I have started using a website called cplusplus.com, it’s been extremely helpful but It feels like it’s not enough.. I read, implement what I have read, but when I try to do it by myself the knowledge is just not there anymore. any tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I need help in converting the Devanagari letter अ to its integer representation. In python, I can easily use the ord() function to convert it to its decimal representation For example:
 ch = 'अ' print(ord(ch)) //Outputs 2309, which is the decimal conversion of its Unicode representation, 0905 
 Also the .encode() function to convert it into its Unicode representation
 ch = 'अ' 
 unicode_rep = ch.encode('ascii', "backslashreplace") print(unicode_rep) //Outputs b'\u0905 of type byte
 However, when I try the static_cast<int> function in C++ it throws a warning:
 int main(){ char ch = 'अ'; int i = static_cast<int>(ch); cout << i; 
 }
 The output:
 unicode.cpp:7:15: warning: multi-character character constant [-Wmultichar] 7 | char ch = 'αñm; | ^~~ 
 unicode.cpp: In function 'int main()': unicode.cpp:7:15: warning: overflow in conversion from 'int' to 'char' changes value from '14722181' to '-123' [-Woverflow]
 -123
 What can I do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm a scientific programmer. I primarily use Python and FORTRAN. I have to write a code that involves solving a finite difference equation on multidimensional vector array. 
 (1) Defining a multidimensional array: The array is electric field with three components (ex, ey, ez) defined at (Nx, Ny, Nz) grid. Where Nx, Ny and Nz are the number of points along X, Y and Z. So if Nx, Ny, and Nz = 10, 9, 8 my array will be [10, 9, 8, 3] shape. 
 Then I have to define gradient along all the three axes and solve some numerical equations which involves matrix multiplications. 
 I have done this in Python and it was straight forward using Numpy Ndarrays. 
 I recently tried porting my code to C++. I realised that defining multidimensional arrays in C++ is not so straightforward. 
 What is the fastest and easiest method to implement such a multidimensional array in c++? 
 Any advice is helpful.

 1. with -Os they are both the same and they use "rep movsd" as the main way to do things.
 2. if you dont include the headers you actually get materially different assembly. it wont inline those function calls and considering they are like 2 istructions thats a major loss
 3. you can actually get quite far with essentially guessing what the implementation should be. they are actually about what I would expect like I seen movsd and thought "i bet you can memov with that" turns out I was right

 Recently after taking a 2w vacation without much work going on (bless Asia’s cable cuts for creating a 300ms+ latency back to Europe) I realize how much of my life has really been consumed by just dev work instead of doing other things that I want like hiking etc. Sometimes it’s just a bug or something I’m too focused on and end up spending a lot of time on, or some new feature that I’m building…
 Anyone else have this issue or have any advice about it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Folks!
 I am starting off with C as my first ever programming language. (I have some prior programming experience with C and Python but never managed to go pass the basics. Hopefully I will get to a point where I can do something useful with these languages around this time)
 Nonetheless, I am following the classic "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. In the introductory chapter (A TUTORIAL INTRODUCTION - Page 6), the first example to print Hello World goes something like this:
 # include <stdio.h> main () { printf("Hello, world\n"); } 
 When I compiled it with the cc or gcc compiler, an error was produced:
 error: return type defaults to 'int' 
 Naturally, I went back to the thought process that I had in my previous attempts at learning C. I simply declared the return type for the main() function to be void and it compiled successfully. The changed code goes like this:
 # include <stdio.h> void main () { printf("Hello, world\n"); } 
 What am I missing out from the example? Has it something to do with the Compiler Version that I am on? Or is it something entirely different?

 Raptor offers similar performance and capabilities to thrust, but offers a more abstract interface. Raptor provides a set of smart containers (vector, array, vector, scalar) and skeletons (map, reduce, scan, filter, sort) that can be applied over the smart containers. Containers can store the data both on the host (CPU) and device (GPU), and expose a seemingly unified memory address space. Skeletons are executed on the device. Containers are automatically and lazily allocated and synchronized whenever a skeleton is executed.

The teacher was a mathematician, but he seemed to me very knowledgeable in the area of programming also. He taught us that it was convenient not to name iterators with only one letter. I found this good advice myself, so i usually name iterators 'ix' instead of 'i', and so on. Why have I never seen this convention anywhere else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even a single line of including a header produces these errors. I've seen nearly the same issue on GitHub and Stack Overflow. I'm using VS Code with LLVM 18.1.5 and GCC 14.1.0 installed from WinLibs.
 I had a similar problem with only the <format> header, but after updating GCC, this applies to all standard headers. Is anyone else experiencing the same issue? Is this due to a conflict between GCC and Clang (libstdc++ versus libc++, perhaps)?
 Edit: Apparently, passing `-D_Float32=float` to clang-tidy supresses those errors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm aware that std::string is preferred over char*, but is it always the case? For example,
 auto str = "Hello world"; 
 "str" type will be a char*, unless we explicitly mention that it's a std::string. So I'm bit confused here the use cases and if there's any downside (in performance) when using std::string over char* (especially for bytes that are will not be modified later).

 I do like Python, but I miss the types. As for TS. . . It's really not even close as using something like CPP or Java. Writing JS/TS classes feels like weenie hut jr. compared to classes in CPP. 
 I hope to work with CPP eventually but I can tell it'll be a while.

 I have monthly 1:1 with my manager and everytime he wants to know whether I'm liking my work. Now so far I have followed a policy of being as transparent as possible at work. So the next time he asks me this, I'm thinking of telling him that I will be looking for opportunities outside since I can't see any opportunities within the company.
 So far, I've had a pretty transparent relationship with my manager (who is also the CTO btw). Do you think telling him that I'm looking for opportunities outside the company can brutally backfire ? I dont have any offers in hand and I may be at the company for a significant amount of time.

 In my member functions, some of them return type 'Vector'. However, i did not specify the parameters for the return type. Thus instead of simply
 template <typename type>
 Vector Vector<type>::operator + (Vector v2) const
 I must declare it as:
 template <typename type>
 Vector<type> Vector<type>::operator + (Vector v2) const
 I was using a "concrete" return type 'Vector', but this type is parameterized, hence why the compiler complains, it doesnt know what parameter to use for the return type. 
 Here is my header file "Vector.h"

 Though if the hubris does overwhelm, pick an easier game genre, Something one person can do, no matter how brilliant you think you are, you really are not. Still it could of been worse I could of chosen a MMORPGGGGGH
 Don't make a major gameplay change midway (I done 2 on this game adventure, turn based -> realtime & dungeons -> Open World). Lesson learnt, If the game ain't happening, scrap it and start something new, don't try to shoehorn what you have into this cause it will bite you in the ass later 
 Don't roll your own code. i.e re-invent the wheel, Sure this is oldhat advice. But take it from an oldfart, dont. I went from my own engine in c++/opengl & my own physics engine -> my engine + ODE -> Unity & C#. I wasn't cool rolling my own, I was just a dick wasting hours, hours that could of been useful realizing my dream 
  
Positive advice:
  
Only 2 rules in programming
 #1 KISS - Always keep it simple, you may think you're smart doing some shortcut or elegant solution, but 50% of the time you're creating problems down the track, why roll the dice, play it smart. OK this is a mantra but #2 is not well known
 #2 Treat everything as equal. AKA - don't make exceptions, no matter how much sense they appear to make, inevitably it will bite you in the ass later
 Now I still violate both the rules even now (after 40 years of programming) So this is do as I say, not as I do thing
 Don't be afraid to go out of your comfort zone. Myself, In the last couple of years, I've (with my GF) had my child, something I swear I would never do (It happened though) & gone to help in Ukraine. Both totally unrelated BTW

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have never used threading before, but I would like to learn. I have a program in C++ which generates small crossword boards and it's quite calculation heavy. It's a backtracking algorithm so basically it explores one path, backtracks, tries another, backtracks, etc. Therefore I could see the benefit of exploring multiple paths at the same time, using threading.
 However in practice I don't really know how much threading would speed things up. Threading is used for I/O operations involving waiting, but there's no waiting involved here, so would it even be useful? Furthermore, how many threads could I get away with creating? I couldn't tell you if 10 or 100 is a good number of threads for one program.

 My major concern with golang would be speed of development cycle and how well would it behave in a startup environvment with ever changing requirements?
 Another thing would be how easy or costly would it be to find good Golang talent with limited budget of a startup?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working as a lead. All my team mates are at least 10 years junior to me. They respect me and I am driving this team. I also get approached frequently for technical issues they face. 
 But I find it hard to mix with them like I can with colleagues my age. They also tend to be serious in front of me and rarely invite me for tea breaks or unofficial lunches they plan.
 My personality is not at all dominating. (In appraisal review, I keep getting comments that I should be more assertive.) I am little introvert but I still try to lighten the environment and for a moment we are good but then after few minutes everything goes back to earlier stage.
 My concern is this will slowly cut me off from the team especially in future when they will not need my help in solving technical issues.
 Has anyone faced such issues? Is there anything I can do about this or should I just accept this and not worry about it?
 Edit: I am the lead and not a manager. It's not an official position. But I am supposed to lead the team because of domain and product knowledge.

 If I read the ASCII logo from a file, and if I try to read it line by line, and print it (left-side) alongside the information (right-side) I think it's possible in that way, but it would be very inefficient. Any ideas how to do it in C? An example would be very nice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am learning C from Ritchie's book (released in 1988) and in the third example in his book, the temperature converter program from fahrenheit degrees to celsius does not work. It is cycled indefinitely at a first line. I am curious as to why this is, because it's odd that someone who developed C would write bogus program in the guide to learn it. I am editing in Visual studio code and GCC compiler and have all the updates installed for C/C++ libraries.
 This is the code I wrote exactly as is in the book:
 #include <stdio.h> main() { int fahr, celsius; int lower, upper, step; lower = 0; upper = 300; step = 20; fahr = lower; while (fahr <= upper) { celsius = 5 * (fahr - 32) / 9; printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius); fahr, fahr + step; } }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 I’ve recently started taking the Nand2Tetris course. I am currently in week 6 of the first course, which deals mainly with hardware.
 This week though, it is required to build an assembler, which is the first software above the hardware. The course teachers say it can be built with any programming language, like Java and Python.
 The thing is, right now I am mostly familiar with C, but I am also not an expert. I’ve programmed in Python on the past, but I will need to refresh, as I have used C more lately.
 But should I build the assembler, and maybe the next required software (I think it is a VM and a compiler), with C? Like isn’t it too complicated because of all the memory management you have to consider, no classes (as opposed to C++) etc.?
 Also, if you’re familiar with this course, I would like to consult with you if you think I should proceed to the second part? Or take CS50x before, which I have heard is very good for starting out with programming? Is Nand2Tetris part 2 recommended in general?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So it is fully possible to use #define with parenthesis to, for instance, make a an add "function" like this:
 #define ADD(x, y) ((x) + (y)) void foo() { std::cout << ADD(3, 7) << std::endl; } 
 My first question here, is this good or bad C++ practice? I've heard that "macros are evil" but don't fully understand why or what it even means.
 On the the real question of the post, is it possible to use #define with curly brackets? I might give some of you a heart attack now so let's just view this as an example. Is it possible to do something like this:
 #define private_namespace{a} namespace{a} private_namespace{ void some_function() {...} int some_other_function() {...} } 
 In this case you might say "Why not just write #define private_namespace namespace?" to which my answer is a) this is more of a hypothetical question for learning purposes and b) then the coder could write private_namespace some_namespace {...} instead of namespace some_namespace {...}.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Yall, 
 I'm curious on your opinions on the right relationship between fullstack developers and sre when it comes to ownership of load balancing and security services (authorization, EDR, etc.)?
 In this case our fullstack team owns development of a customer facing product which includes our SAAS API and various front ends. The API is composed of micro-services. It does biz logic things like user management, fetching results, ingesting media inputs and passing them into our core engine which is owned by MLEs... 
 We are a small startup, I am the first and only devops engineer at the moment. I initially wrote authorization and owned load balancing into the system but out of feeling that I was spread too thin I passed this ownership off to the fullstack team. My sense over the past few months is that the fullstack team shouldn't ideally own load balancing and authorization, they tend to do things really quickly and dirtily and I suppose I'm not fully comfortable with their approach. My sense is that this should be owned by security minded SREs who are already responsible for production.
 Can you guys assist in providing insight into my potential blindspots? What are your thoughts?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ctreg (pronounced cuh-tredge) is a library for compile-time regular expressions the way they were always meant to be: at compile time! It's a macro that takes a regular expression and produces two things:
  
A type containing the compiled internal representation of the regular expression, or as close as we can get given the tools available to us. This means no runtime errors and faster regex object construction.
 A type containing all of the named capture groups in the expression, and a captures method that infallibly captures them. Unconditional capture groups are always present when a match is found, while optional or alternated groups appear as Option<Capture>. This is a significant ergonomic improvmenet over fallibly accessing groups by string or integer key at runtime.
  
Interestingly, we currently don't do any shenanigans with OnceLock or anything similar. That was my original intention, but because the macro can't offer anything meaningful over doing it yourself, we've elected to adopt the principles of zero-cost abstractions for now and have callers opt-in to whatever object management pattern makes the most sense for their use case. In the future I might add this if I can find a good, clean pattern for it.
 This version is 1.0, but I still have plenty of stuff I want to add. My current priority is reaching approximate feature pairity with the regex crates: useful cargo features for tuning performance and unicode behavior, and a more comprehensive API for variations on find operations.

Structure, union and enumeration types may be defined more than once in the same scope with the same contents and the same tag; if such types are defined with the same contents and the same tag in different scopes, the types are compatible.
  
Which means GCC now lets you do this:
 ```c
 include <stdio.h>
 define Resultt(T, E) struct Result##T##_##E { bool is_ok; union { T value; E error; }; }
 define Ok(T, E) (struct Result##T####E){ .is_ok = true, .value = (T) _OK_IMPL
 define OK_IMPL(...) __VA_ARGS_ }
 define Err(T, E) (struct Result##T####E){ .is_ok = false, .error = (E) _ERR_IMPL
 define ERR_IMPL(...) __VA_ARGS_ }
 typedef const char *ErrorMessage_t;
 Result_t(int, ErrorMessage_t) my_func(int i) { if (i == 42) return Ok(int, ErrorMessage_t)(100); else return Err(int, ErrorMessage_t)("Cannot do the thing"); }
 int main() { Result_t(int, ErrorMessage_t) x = my_func(42);
 if (x.is_ok) { printf("%d\n", x.value); } else { printf("%s\n", x.error); } 
 } ```

 But by "merging" the .cpp and .h files in a single module file, that file will contain all the imports / includes, which will increase the chance of circular dependencies.
 I know that we can still use forward declarations with modules, but now we would be required to not only forward declare a class, but also its methods that we want to use.
 What's the best way to avoid this issue when using modules?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm pretty new to cpp and am trying to work out the best design for a problem I'm having. I'm wondering if shared pointers are the way to go. 
 The problem: I have a class that makes an expensive database query during construction. The information retrieved is static though and most of the class functions don't even depend on the data. Furthermore, a class instance might be constructed multiple times during a single call from the upstream application , and each time this expensive and often unnecessary db call is made.
 My idea: Lazy load the db query only when it's first needed and then store the data in a global cache that will exist for the entirety of the application call. I can't control if 10 instances of this class are created, but I can limit to a single db call instead of 10. 
 Is a shared pointer amongst the class instances a feasible and a solution here? My understanding is that the a shared pointer to the cache will keep it alive as I need, but I'm unsure how to pass a pointer between the instances like this. I'm also wondering if I'm overthinking the problem and there is a simpler solution I'm not considering. I'd appreciate any advice or insight, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I want to write my own NES "cartridge decoder" that will serve as a helper tool during development of my NES emulator. One of it's capabilities will be dissasembly of a PRG ROM. However the thing with these ROMs is that data is mixed up with the code and it can look roughly like this:
 <some data>
 <couple of instructions>
 <some data>
 <couple of instructions> 
 And etc. So if you are looking at compiled binary you really have no way of telling whether given byte is treated as instruction, instruction operand (or part of it) or data used by the program.
 I came up with 2 approaches how I could tackle this:
  
Lazy approach - Just interpret everything as instruction (of course by taking their variable length into account)
 Better approach - Interpret the program, not exactly by executing it but going instruction by instruction, tracking where it jumps or which subroutines it calls. While processing branch instructions process both cases. Read interrupt vectors and interpret them as well until reaching RTS instruction. Everything else would be considered raw data and dead code would also fall into that category. Basically disassembler would go instruction by instruction to determine where code execution can lead to distinguish instructions from the data.
  
I never specifically wrote a dissasembler, so I would like to know if my ideas are at least good, or there are better, more reliable approaches to that out there.

Because of the number and type of operations that are required to find, load, and initialize an algorithm provider, the BCryptOpenAlgorithmProvider function is a relatively time intensive function. Because of this, we recommend that you cache any algorithm provider handles that you will use more than once, rather than opening and closing the algorithm providers over and over.
  
This implies to me that you can globally initialize the algorithm handle and reuse it throughout your application in all threads. But since MSDN doesn't say anything about it, I'm not sure whether that's true or if the handle caching guidance applies per thread.
 Can anyone shed some light on this?

 I'm currently using the latest version of Visual Studio Code alongside the following extensions:
  
CMake by twxs
 CMake Tools by ms-vscode
 CodeLLDB by vadimcn
 C/C++ Intellisense, debugging, and code browsing
  
Btw, OpenAL-Soft was added to my engine project which is a library my game includes.
 I'm running:
  
Latest version of VSCode
 Compiler: Clang 17.0.6
 OS: Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4
 OpenGL 4.2
 Windowing: GLFW
 Also using GLAD.
  
I could just delete and rebuild everything every every morning, but doing this would mean rebuilding my entire project. Has this every happened to you?
 Any tips or recommendations are greatly appreciated.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, fellow Gophers!
 I'm new to Go, transitioning from Python where I extensively used Django and FastAPI to build backends. In the Python world, I was used to riding on the shoulders of giants. Python frameworks usually provide built-in tools for authentication—everything from password validation and encryption to token expiration and third-party logins.
 Now, as I start developing my first API with Go Chi1, I've noticed the prevalent advice is to implement features from scratch. This shift has left me anxious about potential missteps and the risk of creating an insecure application.
 Do you all build auth from scratch when using Go Chi, or are there trusted libraries you rely on? How do you manage the complexity and ensure security? 
 1 Choosing Chi over the many other "expressive, lightweight, API router" was already a tough dilemma (and still I don't know if I chose the right tool). I first started out with Fiber until someone told me "I shouldn't because it doesn't use one of standard lib" though, to be honest, I didn't really understand the reasoning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My boss, the tech lead who at one point was the sole developer on the team, keeps handing over his half-assed / half-completed projects to me. 
 He'll do 30-40% of the work, write zero documentation, and then will tell me to finish it without giving me any context. 
 My boss is the kind of guy who has trouble delegating tasks on a product that's his "baby" and really wants to keep his hands in everything that happens.
 I get that as a senior developer it's my job to work on complicated things, but it takes me twice as long just to understand the code he wrote as actually finishing the project. It also makes me feel like an idiot when I have to ask him a hundred questions about what he's already done + why he made particular choices (which are often not well-thought-out). He also often takes a long time to respond (since he's busy working on 5000 other tasks) leaving me confused and frustrated.
 Better yet, if I end up taking a long time to understand what he's done / finish the solution, he'll get impatient and then will try to finish it himself. 
 This jobs has a lot of perks and I'm generally left alone most of the time (which is great), but I'm getting pretty demoralized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've worked in front-end web dev before, although 95% of my experience is in systems, machine learning, and gamedev as a hobby in c++, java, c#, python etc. I've definitely had an interest in doing web development and I have worked in a small team before to do a simple web app, but I found that the process was absolutely agonizing. 
 ​
 Specifically, javascript seems to take my least favorite aspects of all the languages I know, and puts them together in one singular package seemingly designed from the ground up to make development as frustrating as humanely possible. 
 ​
 I'm learning rust now but I consider myself a beginner still, and even though I don't think I'm quite past the initial growing pains with getting used to it, I am enjoying it and I'm all for trying out literally any alternative in existence to using javascript again. 
 ​
 So as someone who knows nothing about it beyond skimming through the first page of google, do any of you actively use rust for front end? What's the current limitations? I can imagine countless benefits to using it over javascript, but are there any drawbacks to using rust for it over javascript? 
 ​
 I know absolutely nothing about it, and my web dev knowledge overall is extremely rusty and likely outdated. But are you somehow working with frameworks like react but with rust? Or bindings? CSS? Any sort of generalized idea of how it works, what the experience is like and maybe some pointers on good resources for getting started would be really appreciated

I'm trying to understand how the serial port hardware interacts with the system clock. From the documentation I've found online, it seem like the serial port derives its clock from the system clock directly, instead of through the timer DIV, like the audio hardware:
 Cycle-Accurate Game Boy Docs, Section 6
 Does this mean that even when the serial port is not enabled (via SC bit-7) this counter is increasing? What happens when the serial port is enabled? Does the counter reset to 0?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
 repo
 This is a proof of concept/Prototype
 Almost a year ago, I started working on a GDScript compiler. And then stopped because getting GDExtensions to work (even in C) was a pain (because it's not documented). This was my first time using rust, so the code was kinda bad. 
 I have revisited the project, but it's a bit different now. Instead of using LLVM to generate machine code, I generate rust, because if I can use rust I will (even for shaders). 
 And with help of gdext, I won't have to deal with GDExtensions.
 Benchmarks
 The rust version (without optimizations) can run 5 times faster in this case nth Fibonacci number.
  GDScript: 390 ms Rust: 77 ms 
 (Code for the benchmark can be seen in addon/bench.gd)
 Features
  
Function
 Calling functions in the same file
 Math
 for loops
 while loops
 if
 variables
 Addon
 maybe I missed something else
  
Limitations
  
Using other Nodes.
 calling function outside the file
 Can generate wrong rust code
 And a lot more
  
FAQ
 Why rust?
 I like it.
 Will this make normal GDScript obsolete?
 No, GDScript is really nice to debug. And fast to iterate.
 Why is GDScript slow?
 IMO, I think the main problem is loops, it's something that any interpreted language fears.
 Why not make a JIT?
 While it will be better for dynamically typed language like GDScript, but it will be harder to implement. Oh, and JIT's won't work on IOS.
 Why not use rust or c++ direly
 Debug in Godot, run with rust. GDScript is easy to debug for normal people, for compiled languages you need to use lldb or gdb.
 Future
  
beg Godot devs for --script-dump-ast
 Better codegen (this that takes AST and makes rust source code)
 Improve the add-on.
  
I won't be working on this for some time. Writing a parser is only fun the first time, not 2 times + other failed attempts with parser generators. Basically, nothing will be done until --script-dump-ast, and then maybe I will continue.
 Maybe this will revive this issue.

 I had a couple of questions that I had trouble finding answers for on Google and was hoping someone could help me understand.
  
In Linux, GCC compiles my c code into an elf file which can then be loaded into memory when executed. Is there a similar process like this for embedded devices? For example, can GCC generate binaries that are flashed onto embedded devices, or do each embedded device have its own compiler?
 
Since Linux syscalls generally don't exist on embedded devices, what c functions can I use when programming for embedded? I'm assuming that glibc wouldn't be available and printf doesn't exist but do utility header files such as stdint.h still exists?
 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The build stage is taking so long (with a timeout set to 1 hour, often reached…)
 package.json contain a lot of caret and tilde ranges which will lead to inconsistent build stage duration since the command ‘npm install’ will always try to fetch the latest version of a package, and if not found it will download it…
 the use of an npm registry did not fix the issue since the process will be highly dependent on the net bandwith the Gitlab runner .
  
What I have been thinking of so far:
  
Use ‘npm ci’ instead of ‘npm install’ basing on a package-lock.json. This method required the manual update of the npm lock file, or maybe with the help of third-party tools/extensions such as Renovate through the scheduling of an update process
 Configure cache on a separate disk? (Not sure about this approach and how it could help me in this case)
  
I posted here in order to get more insights about the matter.

For those of you working for AAA companies (or even III for that matter), what path(s) did you take to get there? Advice for someone trying to break in? Also I understand that right now isn’t necessarily the best time in terms of hiring vs layoffs, but I’m trying to play the long game here. Also, what does it realistically look like to work for a AAA company? Anyway, not looking for anything specific. Just wanting to hear from other industry professionals.

 After having a very harsh life, an opportunity has finally presented itself and I decided to get my CCNA certification earlier this year (on my first try). However, it is still extremely difficult to get my life back on track. As a matter of fact, months are quietly passing by and nobody has called me about a job interview, not even once.
 Of course, that couldn't stop me from being curious about technology (and networking in particular), so I have moved on and continued with acquiring new skills on my own. My next stop was Kali linux (which I love very deeply) and pretty soon I got obsessed with network penetration.

 At first I was using a unique buffer but I then read that it's better for threads to access separate memory locations so i made 3 different buffers, one for each thread, Here's my code and a little explanation. Feel free to destroy me if I misunderstood something, I'm trying to learn so every tip is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I joined this large global company in 2016. It was pretty good back then. Autonomous teams with great developers building great products. My country was very profitable. 
 2018 it is decided that most development work in my country would be moved to India. Our senior developers would now work as architects, product owners and team leads. Most of our great developers decided to jump the ship. I decided to stick around.
 2018-2020 is a disaster. Everything falls apart. Its so bad that there is a new decision to switch back to 100% inhouse development.
 2021, its hard to recruit great developers and we need to recruit a lot of people. Management and HR is not happy with the progress, too many candidates fail the technical interviews, its taking too long to sign new employees. It is decided that there will be no technical interviews from now on, HR will handle 100% of the recruitment process. Focus on "soft values and skills".
 2022, it is still a disaster. We have signed a lot of new emoloyees, most with wrong skillsets due to HR having no clue about what we need. We needed senior software developers and we got database admins, sysadmins, service desk agents etc that wanted to get into software development. 
 2024, we are still in a very bad state, and guess what? The solution is to move development to India again. The history repeats. 
 I should obviously jump the ship, i used to be a developer, now i just spend my time in crisis meetings, escalations, red alerts, meetings with management etc. However i find this mess to be very entertaining. I always enjoy going to work to find out what madness is going on today. Its like a great tv show, i cant wait for the next episode.
 Has anyone been in a similar situation? Enjoying a terrible place to work at? What did you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I'm a relative beginner to C, my goal is to write a web server on Linux myself without looking it up, or without looking up examples online at least, I feel like I would just end up copying it and I want to go about it properly. I think it would massively boost my coding skills as well as help me understand web servers better. 
 I'm curious what your process is for doing this, or what process do you recommend? As far as I understand, the main way to "look up how to use something" like sockets is to use man pages, and do you just reference those and keep looking at whatever you don't understand for the next thing and next thing to etc.? I feel like I have about 50 terminal tabs open because I'm down the rabbit hole of reading man pages, not complaining because I've found out some super interesting stuff, it just doesn't feel super efficient. 
 Let me know if that's just what we do or if you have some other method, I get there's obviously books as well. I'm a bit sick of tutorials and learn how to code sites, especially when I know the basics reasonably well and just want to get onto building something. 
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm on the hunt for a linear algebra library that implements the upcoming std::linalg standard from C++26 (details here). Given that the standard will likely not be widely supported by compilers until around 2030, I'm interested in using a library that aligns with std::linalg now. This would allow for a seamless transition to std::linalg once it becomes broadly available. 
 So far, I haven’t found a library that meets these criteria. I did come across this post, but it wasn’t quite what I needed. If anyone knows of a library that fits this description, I would really appreciate your recommendations.
 Additionally, if anyone is aware of a wrapper for any established libraries like Eigen, Armadillo, BLAS, LAPACK, xtensor, or Blaze that adapts their functionality to align with the proposed std::linalg standard in C++26, I’d be very interested in learning about it. Such a wrapper would ideally allow for easier migration to std::linalg when it becomes standard. Please share any leads or resources you might have.
 Thanks in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been interviewing quite a few people recently for a remote role and noticed most don't bother turning on their camera. It's a bit awkward but I decided to keep mine on anyway.
 Is this very common in your experience?
 I assume they might do it for bias reasons (definitely had women not wanting to get judged because of their appearance and I get that from what I've seen in our field) or just don't feel like it. I didn't push for it as I generally tend to have my team decide by themselves if they turn their camera on during meetings and glad to do as much as possible in Slack. But for a first time meeting people I still find it super hard to... bond with them and then later tell them apart. Or even hire someone without ever having seen their face once.
 Last time I interviewed people for my team a few years ago I didn't notice this, most just seemed to turn on the cam without having it explicitly stated.
 EDIT: 
 For the next rounds I'll definitely see that I explicitly state "video call". I was just surprised people don't do this by default but perhaps I'm just becoming boomer :). But there's a "give a talk and we discuss" round anyway, so I hope at least there they'll turn their cam on.
 I should probably add, this is for a very senior/scientific role, so we also have to meet customers at least virtually, pitch projects, give talks, hold webinars, perhaps go to a conference etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 I’m relatively new to C++ and have a project im working on. The basis of the project is a basketball game where randomized players and their stats are generated through a draft system then stored into multiple text files. 
 I have correlated the players and their attributes using array positions. I have the system set up correctly where I can write the data to the text file and read from it but I am unable to run the code unless I manually go and delete the info from the text file. Only when I do this do the errors disappear.
 It defeats the point if the players stats are not able to be retrieved the first time they were drafted in the game, as I want to be able to implement a save feature where you can pick up where you left off. I have implemented this by creating a main menu, with a switch function, allowing a player to either reset their data by truncating the text files, and undergo the draft process all over again, or continue with the information already in the text file. The issue is however, as I said before, I cannot run this without deleting the data in the file, which I do not want the player to have to do unless they want to reset the game.
 The errors themselves are 2 C2059 errors and Expected a Declaration in the text file themself, which confused me.

 nb-editor: (Typescript + React) editor for nb-crdt (it can be used for other data structures)
 nb-crdt-go: (Go)

I built nbfm to demonstrate a serverless collaborative notion-level note editor only using shared files. All the work is done alone, so the quality may not be perfect and may not be that great.
 But it holds the potential to become an all-in-one workspace where users have full data sovereignty. I strongly believe it is valuable in the era of A.I.

 This seems so odd, even entry roles I was flat out denied, let alone the higher up ones. 
 Now I'm not mad cause I already have a role, but is the market this bad? have we hit the point where CS is beyond oversaturated? my only worry is the big salaries are only going to diminish as people get more and more desperate taking less money just to have anything. 
 This really sucks, and worries me.
 Edit: Guys this was not some peer reviewed research experiment, just a quick test. A few things.
  
I am a U.S. Citizen
 I did only apply for work from home jobs which are ultra competitive and would skew the data. 
  
This was more of a discussion to see what the community had to say, nothing more.

 I was wondering if anyone might be able to share some insight into what went wrong with my latest release? It's been a week so far and the sales are not ideal to say the least. I'm genuinely interested in learning from this since I'm at a loss.
 I tried to make a unique, fun, challenging, and non-linear detective game and was really excited about it. Essentially the more you play, the more the story comes through and the pieces fit together.
 Here are some highlights of everything I've done leading up to release:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am new to c++, mainly a Typescript dev.
 In TS, I can return union types where it can be either `this` or `that`:
 // Typescript function - union return. function cheese(a: string): false | string { if (a.length < 2) { return false; } return a; } 
 In this trivial example, I can return a false OR a string.
 How can I achieve the same thing in C++? It's okay if the whole pattern needs to be different, but I want to be able to return different types from a function... if possible.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, hear me out, we can all have opinions on Zig-the-language (which I haven't touched in months) but this isn't about Zig-the-language, it's the C compiler that comes embedded with Zig-the-toolchain: zig cc. If you ever had to cross-compile some C the traditional way, you know how painful it is. With zig cc it's literally just a single flag away, -target $TRIPLE. That's it. With QEMU user mode and WINE I can easily test my code for Windows and obscurer architectures all within a few minutes in a single terminal session. I don't need to wonder whether my code works on 32-bit big-endian PowerPC or on i386 Windows because I can just check. It just feels like a better frontend to clang, imo.
 (Plus, zig cc also has nicer defaults, like a more debugger-friendly UBSan being enabled by default)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was at 2 companies in the past 7 years.
 First company was bigtech. I kinda just cruised. I would ask for work, and literally my manager would be like *shrug. I never got any projects... never got any tasks... I literally did nothing for 2.5 years but simple bash scripts here and there.
 So I quit and joined another company. I got a bit more work here, more projects, etc. I was able to get a team of 2 junior engineers, we worked on projects here and there
 I didn't "grow" because I was always the most senior.... I had nobody to get guidance or advice from.
 Whenever we built new projects, I basically "architected" it and built it with the team... but... it was 99.9% me teaching them stuff. I never really learned much I feel.
 Even simple basic things like... code standards, I just did what I felt like was the best. For our software design patterns, I used GoF stuff I learned from reading, where it SEEMED like it would be good, but I had no guidance or feedback! I architected a distributed system when we finally got a bigger project and while it worked and scaled, I have no idea if I did it "right"...
 Now that I'm laid off, and looking for a new job... I feel like a serious imposter during my interviews. A) I "architected" and "standardized code on the team" but... it was a team 3 and it feels like bullshit and I don't really know anything. and B) When I get asked about design patterns... sure I "know" the patterns but... I have about as much experience APPLYING them as a newgrad....
 I feel like my 7 YOE knowledge is LESS than a 2YOE who worked on a big team with a senior engineer advising them

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm currently working on implementing Conway's Game of Life in the terminal using C++, and I've encountered a challenge that has me stumped.
 As I dive into building the two-dimensional grid required for the game, I'm faced with a dilemma: should I use a 2-D array or vectors? My goal is to create a grid that can dynamically change its size during runtime, which rules out arrays due to their fixed size. After some research, I've learned that vectors in C++ offer the flexibility I need, allowing me to resize them on the fly.
 Despite dedicating hours to this endeavor, I'm finding the process of dynamically resizing the grid using vectors to be quite daunting. Specifically, I'm struggling to increase the size of the grid by (rows+2) x (columns+2) when certain conditions are met.
 If there's anyone proficient in C++ who has experience with dynamic resizing of 2-D vectors, I would greatly appreciate any guidance, tips, or code snippets you could share to help me overcome this obstacle. Your assistance would be invaluable in bringing my Game of Life project to life!
 Thank you all in advance for your support and expertise.
 Thank YOU!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, ive been reading about poll and epoll and i think i dont really get why epoll is faster than poll, here is my current high level understanding:
 Poll: loops over a list of provided fds, calling a is_ready() fn and updating another list with the fds which is_ready() call returns true
 Epoll: registers all provided fds into a epoll fd, which on new events will wake up epoll_wait(), tho i dont know how does the event triggering works? i read on some high level explanation that its a dedicated thread that loops over the fds, so equiv to poll but it wouldnt make sense - then on new event, a list of ready fds is returned and the wait update its structure with the ready fds, user then just have to iterate over this list of ready fds
 i dont know if its clear, i hope so.
 man epoll() says this: 
 By contrast, when used as a level-triggered interface (the
 default, when EPOLLET is not specified), epoll is simply a faster
 , and can be used wherever the latter is used since it
 shares the same semantics.poll(2)
 I would like to know if my understanding of how poll detects ready fd is good, and how does epoll listen / triggers on new events, as well as why is level triggered epoll is faster than poll even if it seems to me that on level triggered mode epoll does the same as poll (iterates over fds and check if ready)
 thanks in advance for the help

I am currently on chapter 15 on the book, and I think I have a good understanding of the stuff I read up to that point. However, when I try to program anything real, I get very overwhelmed and can't seem to figure things out. I feel as if the libraries I see are either too abstracted to teach me anything about Rust itself, and I have to learn about the library. Or, things are complicated and I see crazy patterns that take me a long time to figure out. What projects can I write to teach me fundamentals?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have this senior dev join us last year. Soon after they joined we learned that they overengineer and overcomplicate absolutely everything. They pushes back on every feedback they gets in the PRs with very very long responses, links to resources, etc. 
 We decided to let them work on a new initiative, so they could take their time to understand our process since there wasn’t a hard deadline on it. The project has become a deviant and a one-off where they didn’t follow any of the patterns we used on any of the other services. Basically you tell them, we need to do C and to get there we need to build A and B. He then goes and builds E, F, G, H and then finally C. You tell him that that’s not how we usually do things, and then they asks you to write the requirements for it, and they will make sure that C matches those requirements… I don’t think anyone else on the team would be able to contribute to this project or support it, which is almost like a legacy service being brand new.
 They don’t get involved in any of the other tasks the rest of the team does, but constantly requires time from everyone to review their PRs. They also started getting very involved with other teams organizing lunch and learns, presentations, discussions and trying to get buy-in from other teams in how they do things.
 This individual is a very smart person and I don’t doubt his technical skills.. but is really a pain to work with him. He seem to be very obsessed with the processes shared with other teams instead of anything related to us. I don’t know if he is trying to set himself up for a promotion or what, but it is becoming exhausting

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So recently I decided I was going to replace my LinkedIn profile pic since my current one is outdated. While I hadn't yet replaced it I left it blank and suddenly received 2 unsolicited messages from recruiters and 2 responses from other job listings in the span of 1 week. For context, I had spent 6 months and ~800 job apps which I know isn't that many but I haven't even gotten a phone screen. My last and only interview was 6 months ago, where I made it to the final round and was rejected because they had an applicant with more experience than me (I had over 2 YOE and it was a junior role FML). 
 Anyway I'm starting to question the timing of these recruiter messages. I don't think there was anything wrong with my profile picture. The only critique I could think of is that it was a bit outdated so I might have looked too young. I don't really want this to turn into a r/RoastMe post so just bear with me and assume I am just an average looking person. 
 I think the more likely scenario is that there is some algorithm that LinkedIn uses that detects when users become less engaged on the platform and then decides to rapidly promote that user into reengaging again. This may come across as tinfoil hatty but I do think this is the most likely outcome since the timing does not make any sense and I haven't read anything to suggest the job market suddenly improved a ton. I am curious if other people have had similar things happen to them like this.
 Also an FYI I am a White Male U.S. Citizen with 2.5 YOE in a popular tech stack in a west coast city.

Trying to find the balance of just enough documentation without over documenting things when i know it may not be really referenced. 
 What is your take on internal documentation for your team - at least when it comes to reference things. Do you also have documentation which is used to help developers whenever they get stuck an issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes I see the following scenario:
 Playtester: The movement feels very stiff.
 Dev: Oh yeah that's intentional because this game was inspired by Resident Evil 1.
 Your playtester is giving you honest feedback. The best thing to do is take notes. You know who isn't going to care about the "design" excuse? The person who leaves a negative review on Steam complaining about the same issues. The best outcome is that your playtester comes to that conclusion themselves.
 Playtester: "The movement feels very stiff, but those restrictions make the moment-to-moment gameplay more intense. Kind of reminds me of Resident Evil 1, actually."
 That's not to say you should take every piece of feedback to heart. Absolutely not. If you truly believe clunky movement is part of the experience and you can't do without it, then you'll just have to accept that the game's not for everyone.
 The best feedback is given when you don't tell your playtester what to think or feel about what they're playing. Just let them experience the game how a regular player would.

create interface for your struct (already really damn tedious)
 refactor code so that the mocked struct is now passed into your unit either through argument or through parent struct (this can be miserable)
 find the previous mockgen command, append the new mock to it, run (surely there is a better way)
  
Also is there no way to mock a function that is not a method? Or what if a function call is hardcoded into the unit you are trying to test. What would you do then?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I'm working with an STM32G070CB microcontroller and facing an issue where the USART2 interrupt isn't being triggered after populating the TDR with the first byte. Despite configuring the USART with FIFO enabled and setting up the correct NVIC priorities, the data isn't being transmitted, and the ISR isn't called. I've checked the usual suspects like global interrupts, USART initialization, and error flags, but the problem persists. Here's a brief overview of my setup: FIFO is enabled for USART2. NVIC is configured with the correct priority for USART2 interrupts. Global interrupts are enabled. USART2 is initialized with the correct settings (baud rate, word length, etc.). Hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) is enabled.

 I think the answer is no they probably won´t even be the same when running only in the same environment and on the same machine. There is nothing like a guarantee that it will have the same address.
 A modern-day OS assigns the memory arbitrarily (within certain sections of course). This technique is called Address Space Layout Randomization. Also gcc or clang uses the --fstack-protector that prevents buffer overflow attacks
 Hence, my final question confuses me and make no sense for me based on this video is how geohot manage to exploit a buffer overflow attack remotely if addresses would not the same. He first did it locally and then remotely. How does he manage to achieve it?

 My questions are: Do you see yourself using such a library if it is "stable" and working? Do you think it is worth spending time improving it?
 The library became my playground to discover a lot of stuff and there a lot of features. UTF-8 support, wide char, UTF-16 and UTF-32 support with libunistring, _Decimal printing, stdfix.h printing, struct tm formatting, full python format specifier support, monetary printing support, configurable multiple ways of printing floating point numbers - using strfromd or RYU library or my own implementation of floating point printing, …]]></summary>

 I'm a rather new IT architect with a software development background of 10 years.
 I work for a university and when I joined, we had one young devops guy who maintained all our stuff, we have a docker swarm and he knew docker well, git well and linux well. 
 Our 3 in-house devs only wrote code, they knew very little about Docker and this one devops guy managed everything after the devs pushed their code. 
 We then hired one more, they were both quite decent and covered everything and when I joined, I had a lot to learn and to do so I didn't have time to get into that topic.
 But then they both left and we hired 2 new ones. They were also not the most experienced, but had about 5 years of experience and seemed smart and interested and knew linux etc.

 If I assign a string value to a regular pointer, no segfault takes place. So why does it happen when I do it with a double pointer?

I decided to take a look and used tcpdump -r <filename> and saw the names of devices from my own local network specifically my printer. I wasn't using wifite on my own network and never used reader. This seems very odd to me. It was placed in my home directory. Where I put other caps when running wifite. I checked the birth date of the file and it was created exactly when i was using wifite. 
 Has any one experienced this or could tell me why packets from my own local network were captured and then the file titled after a program I wasn't using?

Sub reddits that don't have these rules tend to be very low quality constant spam that only contain other devs, who are not your target audience. I do like those subs just for personal validation and talking about our projects as I have no one in real life to do so with, but anyways.
 Where do you find your audience now, on tik tok or something else? I am not a social media or marketing type of guy, but eventually I'll want to let people know my game exists, where is the best place to start? I understand it's not easy and I don't expect it to be and it'll be yet another skill to add to the list, but I'd like to know your opinions on where to go.

Anyways we had a big company wide meeting the same day and someone asked if there would be more layoffs and the guy basically said "I definitely can't promise there won't be but I can say for the life of the company wether that's 5, 10, 20, 100 years from now we will have many many more". 
 I also learned from some of my coworkers who have been here for 3 years that they've had layoffs every year. 
 The layoffs were not due to performance. They are always simply operational cost things aka your team is costing more than value so bye. 
 Idk it's just so icky. I feel like I need to really work hard to avoid getting laid off. Like my job is always at risk and any day I might wake up and oh I got laid off lol. I get business is business but it's just really fucking icky. 
 I really liked this job but now I'm just icked tf out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been working about 10 years at larger tech companies and joined my first startup (a late stage one) several months ago as a Staff dev.
 When I was interviewing they had told me that I would receive X # of options at some strike price and so I negotiated heavily for more options in my package. Little did I know, they were about to announce a funding round, invalidating the previous strike price and the strike price that I would receive has tripled (which I have not yet been granted). Sure I still get X # options however they are now at 3x the strike price. This means that instead of paying say $200k to exercise my options I have to pay $600k if I ever want to exercise (with the risk that it becomes potentially be worthless if it never IPOs).
 Given that I don't see the company realistically going IPO until at least 5+ years, this means if I leave before then I will have to either shell out a large amount of money or just leave my stake on the table. If I just leave it on the table then it only makes financial sense for me to stay at the company the amount of time equal to the amount of options I am willing to exercise.
 Has anyone else joined in the middle of a raise unknowingly and are there other solutions? Has anyone tried to renegotiate their offer package after joining since grants haven't been issued?

 I'm running latest kali linux on a legion 7, vmbox. Im using a Brostrend A1 network adapter.
 I've put it into monitor mode successfully with 'airmon-ng check kill' + 'airmon-ng start wlan0'. I can run 'airodump-ng wlan0' (my adapter doesn't change to wlan0mon, for some reason, despite an iwconfig showing it in monitor mode). I'm able to catch all kinds of aps and clients, bssid's. 
 Okay so I captured my target bssid, I then ran airodump again to find my target clients. I'm pretty sure my phone is hiding it's Mac address, because it doesn't show up under 2.4 or 5ghz packet capture. But despite that I'm sitting with my whole family and no ones showing as being kicked off when I run aireplay-ng. When I run this I've tried deauth against just the full AP, but I've also tried several device Mac addresses that are showing up. It actually runs the deauth successfully. I'm seeing ack results. But yeah despite trying maybe 5 or 6 times on different networks and devices. It'll run, but it won't kick anyone off. 
 Any ideas? I can post some blurred out shots

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm acquainted with great code bases that heavily use Yaml, so I'm not really sure why other people dislike it. Spring Boot was my introduction, so it might be because I've only ever had good documentation when working with it, but when I see it used for K8s, I have no complaints. What's the better alternative that people like using? (I'm particularly looking to hear from people who hate dealing with Yaml)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies upfront for the long post. I'm going through some existential crisis and just felt like writing it out.
 I've been a developer for around 14-15 years and have worked on a lot of different tech and systems and have a good breadth of knowledge i'd say. 
 But i've never really worked on anything with huge amounts of data or low latency requirements or extremely high throughout etc. Have always worked in big orgs and on systems with moderate non-functional specs and lots of business features. Historically i've not been into developer communities or open source contributions (earlier in career due to lack of awareness and now due all sorts of stuff including lack of motivation to do this outside work hours). I'm trying to change this a bit recently by getting more involved in communities in my company.
 Having said that within my teams i've always got good remarks, hikes and considered as a solid all-round senior. Pay was always good and I mostly enjoyed my work (was almost too grateful to even be hired as a SWE at the start). I also keep myself quite updated even though most of that knowledge stays mostly theoretical.
 As I evaluate my career i wonder if I should have seeked out more challenging work? There seems to be an expectation that after all these years one would have atleast tackled some hard technical challenge and I cant seem to think of any. Slowly starting to feel if i'm actually good to even handle anything challenging now and that's not helping my confidence to even look for such opportunities. What if I get an opportunity and fail?
 Just wondering if others have gone through such a phase and found their peace somehow? Or any advice on how to position myself for the next 15 years of my career?

 Then I do blueprint and some c++ which is still my weak point but I'm learning and I understand it quite well.
 I work with houdini for some things but overall I delve into a lot of different skill sets to accomplish so much since I'm usually the only developer being hired for my clients projects.
 Now this isn't an issue since I'm very passionate about all of it and I'm really in love with code at the minute.

Since then, I've gotten emails almost daily from "Streamers" who are asking for a free Steam key. They almost always say something along the lines of "I haven't streamed in a long time but I am wanting to get back into. I heard about your game from a friend and it seems perfect!" and then link to a twitch profile that has been inactive for two years.
 I know that these are likely bots/scammers looking for free steam keys to resell. My game is 2 bucks though...

 The market is bad and it's hard to get a job. But this isn't unique to tech. A majority of skilled jobs are hard to get right now besides traditionally stable fields like medicine or accounting. Go into any other career reddit and it's the same issue. The amount of posts I see about people regretting getting into CS, thinking of switching majors, or just dropping out of college are so near sighted.

 Also, I'm working on porting DirectX-Headers to C, as they are necessary for the samples, but it is still a bit raw, as I'm developing them on an as-needed basis. This port is on this repo: https://github.com/simstim-star/DirectX-Headers-in-C

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use React.js for building web UIs, It's OK but i would much rather write Go. I tend to dislike programming with js, especially with large projects for a variety of reasons, like slow lsp, large imports section, lot's of dependencies, lack of useful primitives, bad error handeling.
 React.js makes it easy to manipulate the page however you want, also it has a lot of component libraries that handle stuff like animations and certain behaviors. 
 I heard there is htmx but apparently, it's supposed to be an ajax library, i don't mind doing fetches and writing javascript for that (much prefer it actually since there is a ton of stuff i would do when i ajax in case of errors, retries, signal abortion...). The javascript i hate writing is usually the dom manipulation javascript that you use to do something in the page. Is there something that handles this stuff that works with Go?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, i'm currently having some issue with Rust, where after each change I make rust recompiles all dependencies. I've found some post on this topic on stackoverflow, but unfortunately the solutions didn't helped in my case or maybe I misunderstood something while trying them out, so I came here to post my issue.
 use bevy::prelude::*; fn main() { App::new() .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins) .add_systems(Update, file_drag_and_drop_system) .run(); } fn file_drag_and_drop_system(mut events: EventReader<FileDragAndDrop>) { for event in events.read() { info!("{:? }", event); } } 
 I simply add an addition space after the ? character in the file_drag_and_drop_system function. Then press ctrl + s to save the change and after that use cargo run / cargo build. In both cases cargo recompiles all dependencies.
 The things I've tried so far:
  
Some people suggested, that the problem is that the build incremental isn't set to true.
 Others said, that setting the CARGO_TARGET_DIR environmental variable to a different folder might solve the problem.
  
config.toml in .cargo folder
 Prior to my issue I also set up the cargo.toml file after the Bevy getting started guide.
 [package] name = "bevy_01" version = "0.1.0" edition = "2021" [workspace] resolver = "2" # Important! wgpu/Bevy needs this! # NOTE: Remember to remove "dynamic_linking" before releasing your game! # Otherwise you will need to include libbevy_dylib alongside your game if you want it to run. # If you remove the "dynamic" feature, your game executable can run standalone. [dependencies] bevy = { version = '0.13', features = ["dynamic_linking"] } # Enable a small amount of optimization in debug mode [profile.dev] opt-level = 1 # Enable high optimizations for dependencies (incl. Bevy), but not for our code: [profile.dev.package."*"] opt-level = 3 
 I'm using VSCode with Rust Analyzer on Windows 10, Rust version v1.79.0-nightly
 Thanks in advance for any help

 If there is no fork, what are other tools being used to create such VM images in the OSS world?

Yeah, i would recommend not launching a steam page if you are intent on looking for a publisher, as the steam page launch is generally a pretty big marketing beat that they'd want some control over.
  
We've been working on a game that we intend to get a publisher for. Our plan was to launch a steam page soon because I heard somewhere way in the past that before you even pitch to publishers, you must provide proof that people are interested in your game. I've read that some even had to have successful Kickstarter campaigns before big publishers took them seriously.
 So I'd like to ask people here who have experienced having their game picked up by publishers, is that really the case?

Any websites, tutorials, or online courses you highly recommend for learning about x86 architecture, ARM architecture, and the translation process itself would be fantastic!
 
Articles or white papers that provide a clear explanation of the different translation techniques (emulation vs static translation) would be super helpful.
 
If there are any must-read books on this topic, please point me in the right direction! I'm open to both beginner-friendly introductions and more advanced texts for when I get comfortable with the basics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe a better thing to ask would be: how do you ensure you’re recognized for the products of your work?
 I’ve had a strange problem for a while now: despite putting in the same hours as my coworkers, and being very productive in terms of tickets, I have for years now been receiving the feedback that I should work with more urgency, and should try to get things done faster. I genuinely do not slack off at all, but the fact that I keep receiving this feedback (and that it has followed me between companies) indicates to me that I’m clearly at least doing a poor job of representing myself.
 For example: once, after a particularly rough sprint a manager had a version of this conversation with me, and we pulled up metrics, and over the course of that sprint I’d completed more tickets than anyone else on the team, and had completed the same number of “urgent” tickets as the rest of the team combined. (And it’s not as though I just pick easy tickets to pump my numbers)
 In one-off situations like that it’s easy to be like, look, I’m sorry I’m giving off this appearance, but if we look at the actual work that got done I think it’s clear I’m pulling my weight… but it’s really not a conversation I enjoy having over and over. Instead I’d really like to just not give off that appearance in the first place.

It feels like it is dependent on the type of game you are making i.e. multiplayer, single player, coop, open world, shooter, rpg, action adventure, survival horror, etc.
 But I certainly could be wrong. Maybe there is a best/universal/one size fits all answer here. Is there a gold standard of game design knowledge that I am missing here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. So going to jump right in I've been inthe same role with the same place since I started being a software dev just under 8 years ago fresh out of a bootcamp. Without being too much a whiner I'll explain
 1.hired in at too high a role. There was one right below the position I was hired in that I didn't even know existed until a few years later which would have been more appropriate, but I made it through.
 2. This one is the most awkward but basically I had a manager who had a terrible rep for not promoting/supporting his female subordinates (which is someone else I didn't find out until much later and after the guy got laid off)
 3. Covid was weird for my company so no a lot of promotions going on for that first year or so.
 4. My spouse died very suddenly 2 years ago and I discovered him (hard story, sorry) and, as you can imagine, that first year or so after I wasn't super focused on career development. 
 So now I'm living in a different place and am thinking about switching up roles at a new company but I don't really know how to plan out my resume. I know the market is hard enough as it is right now so I need all the advice I can get. Thanks all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm the lead for a small team (5 devs), we do upgrades and new features to a set of analysis tools for a couple of customers that we have been working with for years. A junior dev suggested we implement a set of features on our current project that we had done on the last. I explained to him that we didn't have requirements for that and because of differences in the implementation, they wouldn't really work for this customer.
 On Friday he emailed the customer and asked them if they were planning on flowing us new requirements for the features that we discussed because it would make the tool much better. He didn't copy me, but the customer emailed back, copying me, and said they were considering it. I replied that we could discuss it, but gave the reasons why it wouldn't be a good idea for them.
 They also copied our management and our director came and yelled at me for "requirements fishing" - someone at the customer felt we were trying to increase the scope to inflate the contract value. To be honest, my reply wasn't the best (I didn't think it through enough and I can see why they might have thought we were coordinating)
 I'm pissed, if I were management, I'd fire him. To top it off, I think he realized that it's coming back on him, he disappeared and I couldn't find him Friday afternoon. I've got to do damage control with management on Monday - how would you handle this?

SIZIF: price: 0.99$, released in july 2023, currently has 13 reviews.
 
 Both games are endless runners with a minimalistic style, they have the same features, are both the dev’s first game, have good reviews, and have very little coverage on youtube and other social medias.
 So why do you think one has almost 20 times more reviews than the other? I am genuinely curious because it doesn’t really make any sense to me…

Didn't see a good example on how to use the public key passed from the ssh server into the bubbletea app so I made one myself. General idea is to use one's public key over ssh as a user identifier and then assign user roles to gate off content. 
 You can check the repo out here: https://gitlab.com/rdubwiley/texty
 Hope it's useful if someone wants ideas on how to expose their TUI to the web or if someone is thinking of different ways to need user authentication for their ssh app.

 I remember seeing posts on this sub not too long ago about people complaining that they had too little work to do while making 250k TC and working remotely from their fishing boat. Now, the posts have transitioned from the market being terrible to FAANG offshoring/outsourcing jobs, DEI/race wars, and class action lawsuits against bootcamps.
 Man, this place is really something else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My girlfriend (a non-programmer) recently asked me what it means when programmers say that "everything is just binary under the hood". I started telling her how files don't intrinsically "mean" something and that programs simply do something with the bytes.
 For instance, an image utility assumes that if there is a file.png somewhere and its internal binary layout follows the PNG conventions then it must be an image and it will display that image on screen interpreting the bytes as RGBA values. However, other programs may interpret these same bytes differently and do other things with them.
 To demo that concept in the most obvious way, I created snapsound - a CLI (for now) that allows you to transform any MP3 file into a PNG image but retain the ability to play back the original sound. It's as simple as
 snapsound snap song.mp3 # Creates song.png snapsound play song.png 
 If you're curious, the code is completely open source on GitHub. It can be easily installed with go intall.
 As a summation of this little research effort, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it is to write a program that plays sound in Go! The only thing is, I think that github.com/gopxl/beep (one of the deps) requires CGo to build on Linux, but MacOS and Windows are pure Go, no need for anything else (already tested both).

How do you guys usually imagine your code structure beforehand in detail and cleanly. cuz im noticing that I have the same issue at work my philosophy is to think about the task good enough then start implementing as fast as possible so that if I fail, I fail fast and have time to recover, because in my mind there are stuff I wont be able to predict no matter how long I think about it, but my issue is that the amount of things that I cant predict is a lot more than what other developers cant predict, one of those things is overall structure for example (as simple as it may be :) ), so how do you guys approach this sort of tasks, and if you have any advice on how to improve it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been living in a VHCOL city on the west coast for the past few years, working as a software engineer. My company has an office out here, but announced recently they're closing it at the end of the month, after which I'll be fully remote.
 I don't particularly care for the city I live in, and thought that remote work would be a great opportunity to move to a larger city with more energy, namely NYC. I've been floating this idea around my team since the announcement of the closure was made, and haven't gotten any negative feedback around it, so I felt pretty confident about the topic when I officially asked my boss if I could move to NYC after I become fully remote.
 He got back to me a few days later (after speaking with HR), and said that a move is totally doable, if I take a $50k pay cut in my TC. I was pretty floored at this request, especially since by any metric NYC is more expensive than where I currently live, but the rationale is that the pay bands in NYC are ostensibly lower for my job compared to my current city.
 I'm wondering, is this level of pay cut common for a move from the west coast to NYC? It seems totally unreasonable to me, especially after looking at jobs at some of the other tech companies operating out of NYC. Many of these companies actually explicitly state that their pay bands are identical for NYC and the city I live in currently. Does anyone has experience with this kind of move?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've noticed I've been planning my work not just around my calendar but also how difficult the work im trying to do may be. For example, 8 hours of coding in one day is half as productive as 4 hours one day and another 4 hours the next. So I try to spend half a day coding and half a day writing, networking, and applying to jobs. Sometimes reading fits into this but for material that's particularly challenging or math heavy I may dedicate a coding day to that material.
 What makes this tricky is some days my brain works better than others, and it's not entirely predictable. I coded for 12 hours straight on Thursday because I noticed I was having a "good brain day," but Friday passed and it's now Saturday and I barely have enough brain juice to write this reddit post.
 I'm curious if other people plan their work around things like this and what tips/tricks they may have!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've started learning rust, and for the most part when i have done short coding challanges and parsing of data i seem to be able to make the code work properly (after some compiler error fixes). Most short scripts didnt require any use of lifetimes.
 When i try to get into writing my own structs and enums, the moment that the data access isn't trivial (like immutable linked list over a generic type) i hit a wall with the many smart pointer types and which one to use (and when to just use the & reference), and how to think of lifetimes when i write it. Moreover, the compiler errors and suggestions tend to be cyclic and not lead to fixing the code.
 If anyone has some tips on how to approach annotating lifetimes and in general resources on lifetimes and references for beginners i would very much appreciate sharing them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a seasoned engineer with experience with more than one language and lately I am learning go. I am all in.
 One thing I am still getting used to is how the file system API is designed, I might get used to it with time, but for the moment it feels a bit sparse.
 You have os for most things, filepath surprisingly has a Glob function, then a bunch of things implementing io.Reader and io.Writer and so on.
 I tried very hard for weeks to not write to disk in my tests, but it sounds borderline an antipattern at this point. I would have to create a specific struct with all my functionality and a mock for it.
 What I am used to, and thought was a good design, was to have all fs methods to take a fs instance and given that go does do that for few things I was confused when I don't see that as just "the way to do it".
 Also, os.DirFS is admittedly broken for things that require dynamic paths or cross os compat, which makes it hard to use things like MapFS in your tests (MapFS looks so good on paper).
 Is there something I need to learn about this to get more comfortable or did I get to the same conclusion as everyone else?

 There’s something really sick to me on a fundamental level about the idea of people leaving a job after a few years to go from $160k to $180k. It’s hard for me to personally justify being a part of such a huge class divide. 
 Edit: guys I’m not saying juniors are getting paid that. That’s an example of my friend who sent from senior to staff. It’s just an example of “person getting paid 6 figures leaves job to get paid slightly more 6 figures” and how casual it is would be unfathomable to most Americans, and you’re all showing how out of touch you are by ignoring the point and focusing on the numbers lmao.
 I’m not blaming anyone who jumps jobs (I wish we could hop jobs all the time it’s our right as workers) I’m just curious to have a discussion if anyone else feels the same. But I’m already exhausted of Reddit after 10 comments lmao. It is impossible to have a good faith discussion on the internet 😂😂

I wanted to learn development(Server side to be precise) but I feel like everyone is doing NodeJS,Django etc at this point, so I wanted to learn something different. Should I proceed with Go at this point for development ( I heard its good for server side development) or should I stick with more traditional options. Also at later point I want a job too.

 When someone can mostly go into small indies instead of big gamedev corporations like Ubisoft or EA, is getting laid off or getting fired so frequent? 
 Is here anybody, who only worked for small indie companies (with less than 10 people), and get constantly laid off or fired after maximum 2 years? 
 Is here anybody, who could work for one small startup-like indie company for more than 3 years as a programmer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw this company's website, where they claim to provide "a specialized high-performance managed-cloud" with 100% SLA. They have a cloud hosting SLA page, where they state that customers are not eligible for compensation in circumstances beyond their reasonable control. Those are:
  
scheduled maintenance, emergency maintenance, upgrades
 force majeure events, interrupts/delays in telecommunications or third party services
 targeted attacks
 ...
  
I don't fully grasp the concept of SLA yet, but it feels that they just excluded all the possible conditions for downtime, to be able to claim 100% uptime. It looks even worse because they look like "resellers", in the sense that they are offering you a managed experience of somebody else's cloud (companies can do that?), and then they exclude third party interrupts/delays. 
 What do you think of this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I switched my primary language from C/C++ to rust around 5 years back. I have been interviewing lately for a job change. Most of the interviews were 45 min affairs, solving Leetcode style problems (why ?? - that is a separate discussion).
 Sadly, I have come to realize rust is not ideal for this scenario, and going to switch back to C for these coding rounds. Most of these interviews involved working with 2D arrays, linked list, binary trees and such which would be relatively simple in C/C++.
 More context: I have had to spend a good part of the 45 min setting up these primitives, before even trying to solve the core algorithmic challenge. Few reasons:
  
Things like coderpad don't let you use external crates (e.g) there is one for 2D arrays
 Some questions involve removing elements from middle of lists in O(1) time. I had to hand roll a doubly linked list with unsafe pointer usage to achieve that, which itself easily filled the time
  
With C/C++, these interviews used to go lot better, uh. Now I think: use C/C++ for interviews, rust for product development. Any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I heard this metaphor a long time ago. I forget where and from whom. I also forget exactly how it went, but the basic idea was this. Developers are going to want to build their sandcastles. And the idea I think it was trying to express was the desire of software developerss to build the most complete, robust, and elegant solutions they could engineer for the problems they are trying to solve.
 Sometimes this may be good, but the context I think I remember the metaphor in was that of, "project managers are necessary otherwise develops will never make progress towards a end goal, with endless scope creep and analysis paralysis". Thinking about it now, I think this metaphor was being used in reference to the video game industry when I heard it.
 This post is two part, firstly, and mostly for my curiosity, I was hoping you all who are familiar with this expression could remind me exactly how it goes and provide your take on it.
 Secondly, I would like to start a discussion on the topic. At work, I don't really seem to face this issue that often. But when working on a personal project, I seem to almost never get very far because I get stuck in this trance where I am trying to over engineer the first problems I come across with any amount of complexity. For example, I have tried writing a vulkan renderer multiple times now, and each time I get stuck on trying to build a thesis on device and queue selection, coding for every use case that I can imagine, when in reality I only need one or two simple methods for accomplishing this task. So, have any of you also ever struggled with this, and what are some good ways to work around this?

You can use the latest stable version of .NET (8.0). Godot 4.2 will still default to 6.0, but you can edit your .csproj file to change this.
 
Believe it or not, you can use full native AOT compilation with C# in Godot projects. That's right: no more virtual machine IL interpreting JIT nonsense. Real machine code. Interpreted languages require too much imagination.

I have somehow ended up managing a team of 10 persons, mostly vps and some associates. I am director myself and now barely code, although need to debug regularly to help the team when they are blocked.
 Thing is I was a bit naive and thought I had to climb the corporate ladder to increase comp, but I have now realised I would be much happier as an IC. I can now see that some vps are better paid than I thought so I would not mind going down a level and revised down comp.
 I find the management side of things quite draining actually, and I don't feel the numbers add up to justify it.
 Wondering if anyone ever went though the same process? Internally or applied externally for an lower rung role?

 My company has used Udemy for a long time, but I've been in IT for awhile so never used it. On a curious glance, I looked at a Linux course on udemy last week, I've been using Linux for years so didn't imagine I'd learn a bunch. It was amazing! So much interesting stuff I'd never come across before.

 I've been interested in cybersecurity for a long time and even took the CompTIA Security+ certification a few years ago just for fun, but that is the extent of my relevant experience. I want to use this as an opportunity to upskill myself and finally break into a field that I am genuinely passionate about, and I do not mind starting from the bottom. I have enough saved that I can go at this full time, 8-10 hours a day, for the next 4 months. Importantly, I have basically no other commitments.
 I have outlined a plan:
  
 Month 1: TryHackMe + HTB boxes with walkthrough to get the basics down and document all progress. 
 Month 2: Study for and take the PNPT (can't afford the OSCP), continue with HTB and THM. 
 Month 3: Renew Security+ cert and start applying for tons of jobs, keep going at it with HTB and THM. 
 Month 4: Keep applying, and hopefully get some interviews, and keep doing the same stuff and document all progress. And if I get no results maybe try my luck in Bug Bounty hunting.
  
I know this is a massive undertaking, and I realize it's going to be a tough few months. But I've always seemed to learn quickly, and I'm very committed to making this happen.
 I would greatly appreciate any feedback, critique, and advice that could help me in my journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've written pktstat-bpf, a simple replacement for ncurses/libpcap-based pktstat, using Linux eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) program, allowing packet statistics gathering even under very high traffic volume conditions, typically several million packets per second even on an average server. In this scenario (high volume, DoS attacks etc.) typically regular packet capture solutions start being unreliable due to increasing packet loss.
 By default it uses TC (Traffic Control) eBPF hooks with TCX attaching requiring at minimum Linux kernel v6.6 for both ingress and egress traffic statistics. Alternatively it can switch to XDP (eXpress Data Path) hook but with a consequence of losing egress statistics since XDP works only in ingress path. XDP mode due to XDP program to network interface attaching calls requires at minimum Linux kernel v5.9. Some distributions might have backported XDP/TC patches (notable example is Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel) and eBPF program might work on older kernels too.
 When using XDP on SmartNICs (100GE and more) it is possible to run in XDP Offloaded mode where XDP program loads directly on NIC with hardware XDP support and executes without using CPU, allowing wire speed statistics even on 100+Gbps speeds.
 At the end of the execution program will display per-IP and per-protocol statistics sorted by per-connection bps, packets and (source-IP:port, destination-IP:port) tuples, either in plaintext or as JSON.
 Program consists of the eBPF code in C and the pure-Go userland Golang program that parses and outputs final IP/port/protocol/bitrate statistics. Go part of the program uses wonderful cillium/ebpf library to load and run eBPF program, interfacing with eBPF map.
 I would be glad to hear about any improvements, bugs or otherwise. File an issue or ping me in the comments. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apart from using an actual debugger - in some cases you can’t have a debugger attached to the process, or the behavior you’re facing is complex and emergent, and you cannot just put a breakpoint or log statement there. If attaching a debugger is possible, then of course I just attach a debugger.
 Let me share mines:
  
Isolate - if something’s tricky, try to have the simplest isolated reproduction that you can have. This cuts out unnecessary complexity and usually also speeds up iterations.
 Isolate early - it’s tempting to think that “I just need to fix this here, redeploy and it’ll probably work”, but I found that more often than not, I should have isolated the case earlier. It’s balancing between the likelihood of fixing it in place in a couple of iterations with a longer cycle and between investing time upfront in the isolation to have shorter feedback cycle. Also, the skill of efficiently isolating cases is something that improves with practice.
 “Approach from two ends” - I’m not sure if this has a name, sometimes it can be called ‘binary search’. When I tried everything that I could think of but it all doesn’t seem to make any sense, then I step back and try to ‘brute force’ it. This usually starts by taking my problematic case on one end, and a known working example of what I’m trying to achieve on the other end. Then I start modifying on both ends: stripping down parts on the first end, and adding more and more parts on the other end, so that they become more and more similar. At some point, the difference that I didn’t think of pops out. A similar approach also works for example if a new release of an app has a regression, but it’s not clear from the code change why - then we can start producing synthetic approximation releases in a test environment to see where exactly things break. I really like this approach, it really helped me solve cases where I had no idea why things don’t work.

 Someone purchased my game recently and ran it on a very low spec Linux laptop. They knew full well that they didn't meet the system requirements, but wanted to try it anyway. Turned out the game ran pretty awfully on Proton because of their hardware, the framerate skipped wildly around, their progress kept getting wiped out, and certain textures either didn't load or popped in after several minutes.
 I had put off building for Linux until I could boot it up myself on an old PC, so I spent the day trying to debug the issue with them and figure out if there were certain settings that could improve their experience.
 In the end, we couldn't find any fixes. So I took a leap of faith, put all my chips on Godot and just blindly built a Linux version for them without testing it, figuring it probably wouldn't work but was worth a shot.
 It worked PERFECTLY, first try, no issues.
 Love this engine, love you guys. Shown above is me and the new player absolutely dumbfounded by Godot effortlessly taking care of business.

 It was one thing doing a bootcamp in 2021 or even 2022, but operating a bootcamp in 2023 and 2024 is straight up fucking fraud. These are real people right now taking out massive loans to attend these camps. Real people using their time and being falsely advertised to. Yeah, they should have done their diligence but it still shouldn't exist.
 It's like trying to start a civil engineering bootcamp with the hopes that they can get you to build a bridge in 3 months. The dynamics of this field have changed to where a CS degree + internships is basically the defacto 'license' minimum for getting even the most entry level jobs now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There really is too much to know these days, what areas are there to specialize in?
 My thoughts:
 Kubernetes - I can see why some engineers love it. An awesome paradigm at the base layer and so much interesting built on top of it.
 Observability - almost a science in itself and plenty to get into (or related to) be it monitoring, alerting, analytics, service management. 
 Platform management - building out a consumable platform, kinda like being a developer for developers.
 Architect - the problem I have with this is developers are going to have their own software architects doing system design that the may overlap already with the infra side. Also many expect engineers to have software architects skills anyway. So where does that leave the cloud/DevOps architect? I feel there is not much mileage in this path.
 Any others? As each year passes the more I think it is not a good idea to stay in the middle as a generalist and time to pick a path.

 Godot Project Builder is a graphical automation tool for exporting and publishing Godot projects. It supports automated tasks for exports, uploading to popular stores (Steam, GOG, Epic, itch io) and basic file operations, all configured using a convenient GUI.
 It's available as a project (requires at least Godot 4.3 dev6) or executable. You can get it here: https://github.com/KoBeWi/Godot-Project-Builds or in the AssetLib. Includes installable plugin for quick launch directly from your project.
 Project Builder supports exporting projects both from Godot 4 and Godot 3.

 I didn’t know GitHub Actions was free when the repo is public. This makes it SOO much easier to get started with the project, so thank you stranger who suggested this!
 https://github.com/tferrari92/automate-all-the-things
 The Azure DevOps version is still there in its own branch.
 Any other feedback or suggestions are always welcomed! There's always room for improvement.
 Also.. Nirvana Edition with Backstage.io is coming soon!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Recently I joined company with very bad codebase. Plain react with javascript, no standards, no linting or type checking, first changes dating back to 2015. Codebase is editied by everything based on their needs, so you can image quality of the code.
 Converting to typescript is impossible due to scope and lack of human resources. Everyone in the team likes current setup and really not cares about improving. Mgnment wants me to improve everything (they don’t know what, they just want to be sure that project is up to these days standarts) and fix bugs that noone can fix. So naturally other devs are maximum junior-mid level.
 I feel like I am loosing my skills and this is my biggest worry. I am super afraid to become bad at coding after working in these kind of projects. I am literally abandoning typescript and good coding standarts. No one wants to do big improvements or changes, only me. Should I try to do something about it or better not waste my time and switch company? I have joined this company due to pay raise, but it feels like skills cut…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a fairly experienced dev with a broad knowledge so I tend to move around teams as needed. It's kind of my thing and companies like it because I always work on top priorities.
 However this has exposed me to the fact that every single local build never ever works initially. Normally there are some docs slightly out of date, you follow them and error. Some unhappy container, undefined variables, some stuff that doesn't install, unit tests won't run.
 The only way to make it run is to fight through it during long several days of debugging, normally heavily assisted by someone in the team that has the right lore (normally this person is busy for the same reason so can only help here and there) 
 It kills me that in my 10 plus years I haven't seen much progress in this part of the dev cycle. Docker was supposed to fix it but then we made stuff around docker complex. We have fancy complicated and fragil infra. Don't get me started with stuff like bazel. When Mr bazel had enough and leaves the company, it becomes the "we don't know what that does so don't touch it" and it's exactly where it will break when I'm trying to get up to speed. 
 Sorry a bit ranty. 
 Have I been unlucky in my career or have you seen this issue too? Have you found some strategies that solve or help with this?

I also am very confident in my model and rigging skills. While developing games though they tend to feel very sandbox-y and tend to not feel quite as polished as a lot of professionally made games. I’ve added some polish techniques like invisible walls, more linear level design but they still feel “projecty” and not at the level of a product. Any tips and tricks anyone has to make their games feel more professional?

 Please don’t suggest me the ZX spectrum or other Sinclair computers because those don’t have any kind of graphics chip or sound in many cases.
 I am more interested in suggestions around Commodore 64, Apple IIc, IBM XT or similar computers. 
 Thanks in advance.
 P.D. My real goal is to understand how much harder an old school computer emulator is compared to a GameBoy or NES emulator.
 I don’t know if I am being naive but the existence of family basic for the Nintendo Famicom leads me to believe that an old micro computer could be very similar to old consoles in term of emulation

 Hi! I recently (finally!) finished a planned blog post introducing the Lua runtime piccolo and I wanted to share it here. This is not a new project, and I've talked about it before, but it has recently resumed active work, and I've never had a chance to actually talk about it properly before in public in one place that I can point to.
 This is not meant as an advertisement to use piccolo or to even contribute to piccolo as much as it is a collection of thoughts about stackless interpreters, garbage collection, interpreter design, and (sort of) a love letter to coroutines. It is also a demo of piccolo and what makes it unique, and there are some examples for you to try out in live REPLs on the blog post.
 I hope you find it interesting!

 How do you ensure that your monitoring stack is working as expected and you didn't messed up the config?
 If you're using a Saas (Grafana cloud, datadog, whatever) do you have another solution that will alert you in case of an outage?
 Maybe it's just that there's no simple solution that's worth the effort. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I thought this was perhaps just something that is exclusive to the games I am making. So I boot up some games in my backlog, games I haven’t played yet. No luck there. So I boot up some games I played in the past, games that I loved, no luck either. I am a solo game developer, so there’s no escaping the play testing phase. Does anyone else have this problem?

 I'm 7 years into this. I want to exit at 10 years to do something else after paying off my home - paying off the home so that I can afford to go down in income. 
 Right now I'm balancing my full time job with my side gig that I'd like to eventually transition to a full time gig. 
 Anyone else doing this? So many people want to transition into tech that I feel like I hear fewer stories of seasoned tech employees transitioning out of tech, though I know it must be a thing and I am not the only one.

The DMCA takedown request has images of the "infringing works" but all of the claimed assets are from different mod from the same game that my mod is for, none of those assets are in my mod or hosted on my server.
 My hosting company has given me two options: 1) remove the infringing content or 2) reply with a valid DMCA counter-notice and wait 10 days. My problem is that I have no infringing content to remove and I don't want to wait 10 days to bring my server back online.
 Has anyone dealt with false DMCA takedown requests? I would like to be transparent and publicly post the full DMCA request and evidence for my community so they can know what is going on and see that we have infringed on nothing. Is this worth getting a lawyer for? This is a hobby project that doesn't take donations so paying thousands of dollars for a lawyer isn't an option.
 Thanks.

 Now that brings me to the title. 
 If you're someone who does system design interviews for Staff+ positions, what are the reasons you reject them? 
 Assume the scenario where the candidate thinks it went well. Yet you looked for some important things and you reject them. Why?

They apparently had a random in-person meeting with the superior behind my back where they talked status and prioritization. There was no outreach or status inquiry on my end as the lead.
 I don't really know how else to take it. Seems not random to me, and it feels like I'm getting edged out for some reason.
 Have you guys had something like this happen before? Should I position one way or another in response to this?
 I've always ran the meeting in the past, and we're ahead of schedule. It just seems weird that they've taken the reigns and spoken in my place when I was the lead on it. Maybe I'm reading into it but it seems pretty blatant.

 Hi everyone!
 I posted about Luminal a few months ago, and since then we've made significant progress in the CUDA and Metal compilers.
 For those who don't know, Luminal is a a deep learning library that uses composable compilers to achieve high performance. It's entirely written in Rust and orders of magnitude simpler than comparable ML frameworks.
 Recently we've been working on speeding up performance on Nvidia and Apple GPUs, which led us to write compilers capable of generating kernels on the fly. These kernels are compiled once and ran many times, and since the whole compute graph is known at compile time, we can get very aggressive with the kernel optimizations.
 We're adding tons more features (autograd landed a few weeks ago, so training is now possible!) so check out the blog post and the repo if you'd like to know more!

 But in software, things change so fast that you never really get to 'expert' level, and always need to keep learning new things. 
 So how long do people usually keep this going? And does upskilling get challenging with age?
 I've rarely ever worked with engineers who were in their 50s or above, and the few I have worked with seemed like they did struggle.
 Is this a career for the young and not something you should plan to do for the rest of your life?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really love working on Rust up until I have to add async to the mix. Lately I just avoid adding async at all costs because it just comes with so many caveats and gotchas that the effort is sometimes not worth the performance improvement. Some of the things that I absolutely find annoying:
  
async is not part of rust, it's a library. The main one being Tokio with no real alternative. I applaud the work done on this but it all just feels horribly hacky. 
 
any time you have to use async you taint all your functions and types with it. As if dropping a bucket of paint (worse than paint but let's keep it civil) all over your code. It makes refactoring a horrible experience. As you crawl your codebase to make it async you eventually end up with an impossible task and have to find ugly alternatives (looking at you async fn in traits)
 
while the rust compiler has been an amazing tool along the journey, it just fails miserably with async. It won't complain at all if you forgot to remove a blocking fs call in an async context and of course it will fail horribly at run time. And when the program eventually crashes, it will just render the most obscure stacktrace i've ever seen. FAR from the developper experience of vanilla Rust.
 
 Overall for such a great language with so many features, it just feels broken as soon as you put your finger in the async business. I ve been looking at the async improvement proposals but apart from async fn traits, i just don't see anything revolutionary that would make the experience better. 
 At some point, shouldn't it just be part of the language if async Rust is to improve in a major way ? 
 Disclaimer: I am not a Rust expert, but i ve been programming for 25+ years in many different languages.

 As far as I know, it appears to be using rusts type system but with a GC. It might be a good fit for small projects where rust could be overkill. Or maybe as a scripting language.

 Jobs opening on my level (lead security architect, etc) - dozens of apps within hours as far as I can tell. Before I started my current job 5 years ago, I’d get recruiters trying to poach me every single day over LI.
 Also considering the fact that I’ll be pushing 50 soon makes the future looking very very bleak for me.
 Not even mentioning the pay — market has capped it on a level 5 years ago at least.

 He said Sorry we're looking for backend developer and hung up on me.
 I knew the technical discrepancy between engineers and recruiters were there however I didn't suppose the discrepancy could be this large.
 Edit: he might just wanted to hire pure backend developers but again there was no need throw full-stack developers out of the window, some full-stack developers are more backend focused (like me) than others.
 End rant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am writing a C64 emulator as my first real emulator project after CHIP 8. As of now I have implemented the CPU, bank switching and rendering the screen memory. 
 I loaded up the character, basic and kernal roms and it expectedly didn't work right away. I fixed a couple of bugs but it still doesn't work and I feel stuck.
 The code seems to execute normally but at some point it enters this section of code and it is stuck in this loop infinitely: 
 ramtz1 inc tmp0+1 ;move index thru memory ramtz2 lda (tmp0),y ;get present data tax ;save in .x lda #$55 ;do a $55,$aa test sta (tmp0),y cmp (tmp0),y bne size rol a sta (tmp0),y cmp (tmp0),y bne size txa ;restore old data sta (tmp0),y iny bne ramtz2 beq ramtz1 
 It seems to me that the bne size instructions are the only way out of the loop, but I dont get how they would ever trigger. It stores the accumulator value into memory and then just compares the accumulator against the the memory location the accumulator was just stored in. How are they ever not equal?
 I must be missing something.

 I am very new to emu dev and this is my first C++ project, and I am having some trouble getting the basic IBM CHIP8 rom to work. I've linked the repository below to see if someone can tell what is wrong. If you simply compile the program then run "./build/debug/emu roms/ibm.ch8" it should run and show the output. Some of my code is from other projects on the internet and some I wrote myself, but I'm trying to identify what is not allowing it to work correctly. In my execute cycle, I am only running the opcode functions that are required for the IBM rom to make debugging easier. Thank you to anyone who can help.

 I'm having multiple issues, specifically in the PPU. Ice Climber is the most obvious with the title screen demo. But Donkey Kong has a broken main menu with a bunch of blue 0's. The demo has a bunch of magenta 0's at the bottom, and the screen shifts a ton randomly.
 Baloon Fight is the best one, with no obvious glitches.
 This is what I currently have: https://gist.github.com/TaromaruYuki/5c3821a024b6e44a733bf3f67bb6673a
 I'm thinking it's a scrolling issue, or even a nametable switching issue, but I can't find anything.

 Hi again! Last time i posted here was in 2019 I think with my chip-8 emulator. Now I have a created an Intel 8080 emulator!
 It started out as a space invaders emulator but I got more interested in creating a disassembler/debugger and implementing all the instructions instead :)
 For those interested in creating an intel 8080 emulator i have modified the (common?) test cpudiag.bin rom since it assumes the start address is 255 and not 0 which makes all the jumps/calls go to the wrong addresses.
 Links to source code and test rom:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm positively surprised by the performance. It struggled to keep framerate at 10fps. I've refactored bunch of places which had sub-optimal code, but what really done wonders is moving from usage of emscripten_set_main_loop to Emscripten's Asyncify.
 Next steps:
  
Addressing some graphical bugs in other games (I've found some minor ones in Tetris in Excitebike)
 Implementing Controllers
 Implementing other common mappers other than NROM which is implemented at this moment.
 Implementing APU.
 UI tweaks (Right now, the thing that is buzzing me is the label of file input, that cannot be changed and it depends on browser language; Polish in my case, so I'm thinking about making custom one)
