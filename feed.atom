        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i am doing a recursive merge sort for a singly linked list. this is a part of the code i have:
 struct node { int value; node* next; }; ... node* mergesort(node* input, int length) { if(length <= 1) { if(length == 0) { return nullptr; } else { return new node{input->value, nullptr}; } } … } 
 this is the documentation from my professor about that function:
 /* mergesort(input, length) Recursively Mergesort the `input` list (whose length is given by `length`), returning a new sorted list. Must run in O(n log n) time, where n = `length`. Must use O(n) space (returned list is created new). NOTE: The `input` list must not be modified in any way. */ 
 and these are a couple of the requirements for our code:
  
The returned list must be entirely new; none of its ->next pointers should point into the input list.
 Your code must not allocate any dynamic memory other than what is required for the nodes of the returned list. (The test code will destroy this list before exiting, so if run in Valgrind, it should report no memory leaks.)
  
in my professor's test file, the sorted list is destroyed and heap memory is freed. however running the program with valgrind tells me i am leaking 10,115,136 bytes in 632,196 blocks and I cannot figure out why. if anybody could help me out i would greatly appreciate it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to program in c/c++ back in the day (15 yrs ago) but haven't followed the developments since then, so I'm unfamiliar with all the newfangled features in the new c++ standards. I'm reading the book "A Tour of C++" (3rd ed) and this tells me, didactically, what new c++ looks like, but since the best way to learn is to read/execute & experiment with code, I wonder if anyone knows of a good codebase that uses the modern idioms? In particular, I want to see good use of concepts, templates, modern STL usage, "memory-safe" pointer mechanisms. The book is excellent, but it only has code snippets. 
 I'm particularly interested in client/server stuff, so (for example) a socket server/client would be magnificent. This is not to say that other sorts of projects wouldn't be welcome.

The way I would teach myself is to make notes and pratice writing the code presented from scratch without looking at the code. I would keep doing that until I dig it deep into my memory.
 The issue i'm having is that I keep thinking and worrying myself that I will forget everything i've learned and struggling to keep the basic facts in my head such as "What is a variable?" "How do functions work?" and I feel like i'm missing important information.
 Is there any better way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a simple singly linked list, where each node has a next pointer to the next node, and a data pointer to whatever the consumer wants to point to. I want the same linked list implementation to be able to hold both function pointers and data pointers.
 Since void pointers are not allowed to be converted to function pointers in the C standard (I think since processors with Harvard architectures can store instructions and data differently?), my current solution is to create two wrapper structs, one for instruction and data pointers respectively, and then have the linked list node point to the wrapper. 
 Is this the simplest way to go about things? Here are some things I thought about:
  
Section 2.12.3 of the POSIX standard (PDF) says that function pointers should be safely convertible to void pointers and back, but I want to make my program portable to non-POSIX systems if I can help it.
 I thought about simply having a void pointer which could either point to a data pointer or a function pointer, instead of having the struct wrapper. But I don't think this works because we would need to allocate space for the function pointer to live, and malloc only returns void pointers, so we get back to the same problem.
 I could simply having two implementations of a linked list, one that holds function pointers and another that holds data pointers, but I want to share as much code as possible.

Mine uses Vulkan and Imgui and I implemented multithreading. Hardware on one thread, the gui, basic control logic and swapchain stuff runs on the main thread, two for audio processing (one for filling a ringbuffer and the callback for SDL audio output) and another thread for uploading commandbuffers from a queue to trigger the texture upload to the GPU VRAM etc. It's running at roughly 30-35% CPU usage on a 5800x3d. Should I consider optimizing some stuff or is this relatively normal? There is some other stuff going on in the background because I added a debugger, memory observer etc.
 The memory footprint is relatively small, roughly 200MB when running pokemon crystal, 30MB in the menu (no game running)

 I'm looking for a place where I can find collaborators that would help me build a engine/framework, and help me with all the memory stuff. I already posted on a discord server about game dev, but most people seem to be unity programmers or things other than programming.

 I'd like to implement the interfaces that are used in the business logic layer by using template bindinds with concepts, in order to determine at compile time the right interfaces, avoiding to create an interface, a realization of it and then passing the pointer in the constructor. Instead I'd like to:
  
Define the methods of an "interface" that are needed by the business case in a concept.
 Create a concrete implementation of the interface without using inheritance, and so using virtual functions (I'd like to use the methods in critical performance path, where indirection time matters)
 Allowing to unit test the business case, because without a virtual interface I cannot use mock libraries like FakeIT.
  
So my question is: where can I find some good resource about concept and using them for dependency injection?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was working on a personal project yesterday in C++23 and was running into a linker (ld) error stating that my constexpr had undefined symbols. After some digging, I realized that constexpr objects are implicitly inline and must have their definitions visible at every compiler stage.
 That being said, I had to move the function definitions from their .cpp source file into their header file, but I was wondering if there was still a way to keep the definition in a separate file (while preserving their constexpr modifier)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently programming my NES emulator and so far everything is pretty straight forward. I simply emulate every single instruction on my virtual nes and so far it works pretty well. At least in terms of performance.
 But I can't see this approach working for larger machines like the Wii U. Do they translate the assembly, or are they generating some intermediate code that is executed by a virtual machine? I doubt that every single instruction is emulated like on my NES emulator. I can't imagine that this is performant. But maybe I'm wrong. It would be really interesting to know what black magic is used in those emulators.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having a 2024 problem. The issue is that the VS Code console I use to run the code, aka the compiler, does not work as intended for the C exercises in the book. As you may be aware, things like backspace or the EOF is not something that the compiler in VS Code will let me handle, it just handles these things on its own, hence I can't actually check for EOF or a backspace. This is obviously a problem when it comes to these examples and exercises. 
 The question is what are my alternatives here? I want to run this in old c compiler as the book intended without dealing with something way too old and hard to navigate, or like a keyboard-only interface. If its important, I am working in Windows.

 (This does not, so both printfs here are the same string, i expected after the strncpy it to be the same as the temp_string)
 So the last strncpy here does not effect the feeds_temp[j+1][k], the printfs before and after are the same
 SOLVED: i made the temporary string be a char pointer to the original string and then when changeing the original string i forgot that i also change the contents of the temporary string

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The time it takes to reach vblank is seconds which is obviously too slow. I decided to output the time it takes for the main loop to iterate once and it's ~2000ns which is much larger than the 238ns needed for a single cpu & ppu cycle.
 I decided to time my code even when the main loop does no work via:
 while (app.running) { QueryPerformanceCounter(&end_time); delta_time = static_cast<double>(end_time.QuadPart - start_time.QuadPart); delta_time *= 1e9; // nanosecond precision delta_time /= frequency.QuadPart; printf("delta time: %f\n", delta_time); start_time = end_time; } 
 This made no magnitude change to the time which leads me to think that I need to calculate how many cycles have occurred between each iteration (~84) and simulate them.
 Before I go about implementing the above I wanted to check that this is the correct approach?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Personally, I like to run things with zero team building and socialization happening during the work day. I also don't like meetings that aren't directly feeding into meeting some objective or satisfying some stakeholders needs. I also like everything be fully remote. 
 So no team building lunches, games, axe throwing, board game night, etc. No stand ups, no weekly team meetings, etc. Retros are async, design meetings and discussions are scheduled as required around specific topics, and I do optional 15m one on ones with people who like that environment for asking questions or giving feedback. People pair on work when they want, but they can also work alone if they want. Basically just trusting staff to work how they want and achieve whatever is most urgent or needed, and flag stuff when it isn't clear.
 The result I have found is that people on the team can do 4 or 5 hours of work on their own schedule and exceed the output of teams doing +8 hours work in office. So of course I am happy with people taking this extra time and using it for their own purposes.
 However, I know some people really feel like these kinds of team building activities are important for building team cohesion. So, experienced devs, do you prefer to have more team building type meetings and higher contract with your coworkers, such as being in office sometimes and more opportunities to just meet and chat? Or do you prefer this to only be "as needed" as I have tended towards?

 I'm on a Mac and I have both clang and gcc installed. Running make compiles as it should with gcc. But when I added the flag -fanalyzer, I suddenly get this output and error:
 mkdir -p build/./src/ gcc (normal stuff here) clang: error: unknown argument '-fanalyzer'; did you mean '-Xanalyzer'? make: *** [build/./src/test004.c.o] Error 1 
 What is clang doing there? I'm trying to run gcc, and that's what it's been doing just fine so far?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am quite a novice C programmer and one of the biggest difficulties in my C journey so far has been learning how to design APIs (functions, structures, typedefs..).
 I'm taking a course focused on learning C from the bottom up and we are very discouraged from using the standard library in our code, but encouraged to write our own implementations, unless it's for functions that map directly to syscalls or if it's a tremendous task to do so, like malloc.. 
 What it made me realize is that it's very hard for me to come up with good designs, even for small problems, coming up with the right data structures, the right functions that don't take like 5+ parameters, "keeping things simple" as to say, is actually not easy. 
 So, I was wondering if some of you had principles or advice that helped them write "good" APIs, I know it's quite a vague and subjective topic but I honestly feel like there has to be some core principles and guidelines that can help. 
 At least I can speak for myself and say I reviewed some code I wrote a few months ago and thought to myself, why did I write this in such a convoluted way? And most certainly, I am still doing that right now, not even realizing it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I'm working as a C++ dev, and there's a pattern that's everywhere in my company's codebase. But I'm still quite early in my career so tbh it has my doubting myself. I thought this violated strict-aliasing rules so was undefined behaviour, but with how much I'm seeing it in our code it has me doubting myself. As this is written by people with a lot more experience then me.
 If you have a char* or uint8_t* you've read off a socket or character device:
 char buffer[512]; // or std::uint8_t buffer[512] // imagine we're reading from a device or socket into the buffer here... // then later: const std::uint32_t *ptr = reinterpret_cast<const std::uint32_t*>(buffer); const uint32_t n = ntohl(*ptr); // etc... 
 I don't see -fno-strict-aliasing in our compiler flags either. But I thought that while you can cast a pointer to any type to a char/uint8_t pointer, it doesn't work the other way round. The compiler is free to optimise based on that assumption, not to mention issues with alignment, caching etc. 
 If I'm wrong can someone explain where how? I may have misunderstood aliasing rules. Thanks a lot!

 What are the key differences between pointers in Go and C, and why are these differences important?
 I understand that pointers in C allow for direct memory manipulation and can lead to security issues. How do pointers in Go differ in terms of usage and safety? Why are these differences significant for modern programming?

 Hello everyone, I am wondering where IntelX and Google's darkweb monitoring service are getting their lesser known / private leaks? For an example, there is a site called selfstore.hu, an sql dump from their site can be found both on IntelX and Google's darkweb monitoring service but not on any other leak search engine site, only on those two. So where do they get those? Is there some clearner or darkweb forum where people randomly post these for credits (Similary to BreachForums) or just for bragging?
 I want to point out again, these are not from BreachForums. I also tried to look it up in DHT search engines, but I got zero results.
 I appreciate the answers, have a nice day :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I took a Docker course that went over these topics. After finishing it, I was able to understand essentially most of what's covered in this roadmap on a fundamental level. 
 However, I'm not sure how much deeper knowledge I should have for each of those topics, especially for a job. For example, I know how to build docker images using Docker Compose and push them onto DockerHub. I understand how networking works and how to setup persistent volume storage. Would you say this is adequate knowledge for a DevOps role, or should I dive deeper into certain topics? If the latter, what more should I focus on? 
 And considering Kubernetes is quite complicated to learn and grasp, I'm not sure if I should dive deeper into certain things in Docker or move on and focus on Kubernetes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the beginning of the year I have had write C++ in an environment that unfortunately uses the the Dinkumware implementation of the std lib: C++Builder 11. During this time I’ve been bitten by a plethora of in your face bugs that have forced me to invest a bunch of time into understanding and then circumventing the issues. To name just a few:
  
std::optional<bool> doesn’t compile
 std::optional<NonDefaultConstructible> doesn’t compile
 std::visit is broken
 std::variant::operator = will silently mess things up by setting the wrong index
 std::unordered_set::extract will return a handle that when destroyed decrements the number of elements in the collection. So one extract causes two sides decrements.
  
Fortunately, the last version of C++ Builder seems to be moving away from Dinkumware, but until I upgrade, is anyone here aware of a broader list of Dinkumware bugs? Is Dinkumware such a poor quality implementation? Has it always been like that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem (1): The code below uses the following struct: struct Data 1{ struct Data *data1; int data2; int *data3; }; typedef struct Data Data;
 In the code below, declarations for d1, d2, and d3 are missing. (Recall that a variable declaration gives the type and tells the compiler about a variable; e.g., int n; would declare the variable n.) Each of a1 and d2 have one of the following types: Data, Data, and/or Data * First, write three lines of code declaring variables d1, d2, and d3. Then, draw a memory diagram, including clearly differentiating between the stack and the heap, for the snippet of code shown below. d1.data2 = 10; d2 = malloc (sizeof (Data)) ; (d2) .data1 = &d1; d2->data2 = d1. data2; d1. data1 = d2; d1. data3 = malloc (sizeof (int)) ; * (d.data3) = 7; d2-›data3 = d1. data3; d3 = & (d2→>data3) ; I think my answer for the first problem is Data d1; Data d2; int** d3; correct me if I’m wrong but could someone please help with the diagram?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The situation is kind of weird but in a nutshell, tech lead and I (senior level) are friends from college (he’s 3 years older) so we went out for a drink after work one day and he was teasing me a bit about being online more often while doing remote work, something like “dude you be slaking off too much on remote Fridays” (so I can get promoted to staff).
 Somehow, this conversation gets heard by someone in management and after some weird stuff goes on I get put on pip. I talked to the tech lead about it and he was very apologetic to me and mad at management. 
 Recently, I got an offer for the same level at a F100 fintech firm that’s also 3 days in office and slightly better benefits along with 10k more base salary and a comparable bonus structure. I’m super mad at management so I’m thinking about just quitting on Monday with no notice but maybe I’ll screw over my friend a bit too much. Thoughts?

I've reviewed the crash logs generated by game, and it appears there is one particular item, a fountain, that is placed in her game that is causing the crash. The profile.json is encrypted, so I can't just go in there and find that entry and remove it. I'm guessing it uses AES encryption since the crash log mentions Rijndael. What would the best approach be to digging for the key? I've opened up files with ghidra, but for some reason, findcrypt isn't showing up for me to use in analysis. My wife loves this game and I really want to figure this out for her. Is there a better approach to doing this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[so, i got an assignement where i should edit an intial code to print "LIBRARY" in the stdout in the correct order, using fork() and wait().
 this is the resulting code:
 #include <stdio.h>
 #include <unistd.h>
 #include <sys/wait.h> 
 int main() {
 printf("L");
 if(fork() == 0) {
 printf("I");
 if(fork() == 0) {
 printf("B");
 if(fork() == 0) {
 printf("R");
 } else {
 wait(NULL);
 printf("A");
 }
 } else {
 wait(NULL);
 printf("R");
 }
 } else {
 wait(NULL);
 printf("Y");
 if(fork() == 0) {
 printf("!");
 }
 }
 return 0;
 }
 from the above code i got:
 LIBRLIBALIRLYLY!
 which is weird. why the letter B (and other letters) printed so many times instead of once.
 this behavior is changing when adding \n after each character in printf(), like that:
 printf("A\n"); 
 and then i got:
 L
 I
 B
 R
 A
 R
 Y
 !
 i really need an explanation
 thanks in advance

 HR: Bob here is a talented Java developer with 10 years of experience and is eager to learn Salesforce. He’s also a US citizen and with maybe 6 months of training in Salesforce, can do a far better job than someone with just 5 years of ”Salesforce only” experience. Do you want to interview Bob?
 Hiring Manager: No. Bob is not qualified…it’s so hard to find qualified candidates these days. We’ll have to sponsor H1-B visa for “qualified” candidates.
 HR: Ok, we’ll get the process started…it might take 3 months with the hiring and visa process…is that okay?
 Hiring Manager: That’s fine.
 3 months go by…
 HR: we have our candidate and his visa was approved. We had to “change” the job description to suit his exact skill set to submit to the labor department for labor certification. We made sure “no one else” could possibly be remotely qualified for this position except our visa candidate.
 Hiring Manager: Great work!
 HR: Yep, we do this a lot! We know all the tricks.
 Hiring Manager: The candidate will need 3 months to “ramp up”.
 HR: Wait…we could have hired Bob three months ago and he would be half way through getting trained in Salesforce by now.
 Hiring Manager: Forget Bob.
 …months go by… Bob eventually finds work as a Java developer. He never learns Salesforce even though he wanted to….the company is sponsoring the visa holder for a green card…they will be posting his job description on the job board at the back of the building right next to the dumpster (you can’t get to the board…there are some shipping crates blocking it), per the labor certification process (citizens are encouraged to apply)…
 …15 years go by…the visa candidate now has a green card and is ready to move on to greener pastures….he wants to get into AI….he can’t…he’s not qualified…the hiring manager at the AI company will be sponsoring H1-B visa as he can’t find “qualified” candidates.

 I noticed these past year that unless the company is not specifically looking for the "Devops" in name, they will outright not contact you. I applied to multiple positions and almost got every call that was looking for "Devops Engineers", but would get a few answers back if the role was "SRE", "Platform Engineer", or "Software Engineer"; even though the requirements would be identical and my experience 100% matched! I remember I applied to a SRE position where I had every requirement they wanted and they never called me back.
 I wonder if hiring managers are breezing through the resumes and if they see the title of your current job is off they just pass you?
 I am wondering if it would be unethical if you just switch your job title to what they want and explain during the first call you get back that you are technically a "devops engineer" but your experience matches their requirements?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I've been tasked with creating a payment application at my company that acts as an "Adyen wrapper" (and can work with other payment gateways as well). The goal is to develop an abstract API that centralizes payment requests and forwards them to the appropriate payment gateway for processing. Essentially, this is similar to what Adyen does with various payment processors.
 One of our senior developers suggested using a microservices architecture for this project. In this setup, one microservice would receive the payment requests, and there would be separate microservices for each payment method we use. These microservices would then communicate with the respective payment gateways.
 I believe that Adyen and other payment gateways might use a similar approach in their systems.
 Here are my questions:
  
How do payment gateways handle communication between their internal services?
 Is the communication entirely synchronous, with microservices calling each other using HTTP?
 Do they use message queues? If so, how do they ensure the process appears synchronous to the client? For example, when I make a payment request to Adyen, they return the status in the same response.
  
Thanks for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work with C and I have to say, when the topic of how everything is put together when you run a C program comes up, my brain kind of shuts off. I hear mystical terms like linking, compiling, translation units, object files, libraries, headers, includes, etc. etc. and I can't say I have even a decent understanding of any of this. I'm currently working on a task related to a build system that I'm trying to wrap my head around and am thinking my lack of understanding of the fundamentals of how a C program is compiled is a big hindrance. I'd love to dive into this topic to bring up my level of understanding. Any suggestions for books, videos, blogs, or whatever else would be greatly appreciated :)

 I have been using Gameboy Doctor (which uses Blargg’s individual cpu_instrs) and am stuck on Test #7. Specifically, there is a portion where [$EA] A is loaded into (a16) (an address within WRAM), followed by a bunch of loops moving memory between high RAM and WRAM. Then, about 30 instructions later, [$FA] the same portion of WRAM from above is loaded back into A. However, the values are completely different.
 I have checked all opcodes between these, and there is no further modification of this address. My logs and test logs are identical between these. There is no bank swapping, OPCODES themselves look fine, read and write logic looks sound. I am completely out of ideas as to what could be happening here.
 Will post logs when I get home if they are helpful.

This is my first time working at such a small company, and generally at a startup. I joined the company when they were nearing the end of the MVP phase. I've been here for about six months, and everything has gone very well so far. We have successfully met the milestones, increased revenues, and brought the product to a level where the first users can start using it. However, I have some questions and doubts about this.
 I'm afraid that I won't have any work, that there won't be anything to do. I asked the management about this, and they told me not to worry, that the main work is just beginning. Users will start using the product, and we'll start collecting feedback and experiences. From these, there will be a lot of bug fixes, hotfixes, and feature tickets, and eventually, the whole backend will need to be rewritten, etc. I got scared because we progressed so well that we almost ran out of tickets.
 They also said they want to put every financial resources into development and also hiring a new developer this Fall.
 I recently got a raise, and everyone is satisfied with me, but given the current market situation, I am quite paranoid. What would you advise? I'm overthinking it probably.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr - What do you use with THM or HtB to help you remember what they've taught you (specifically when you're early on)?
  
I've been doing Try Hack Me for about a month or so. I've done enough to start to get at the meat and potatoes of hacking, but still far from being able to do it on my own.However, I do have a concern. As I'm continuing my journey on this website, I'm finding that I'm forgetting some things. I'll know the general idea, but not the exact bits of information I'd need in the moment.
 I know the default answer to this is just study, but even if I strap myself to a chair and pin my eyelids open like I'm in Clockwork Orange, I still struggle to remember stuff. I learn best by doing and repetition of the doing, but I'm not sure what I can use aside from THM and Hack the Box. I'm still not at a point to be doing an CTF challenges (as far as I know), so those aren't really an option.
 What I want to know, is what do you guys use in conjunction with these? I looked at the wiki, and I plan on trying some of them out, but I worry that they're going to be too dense/technical for me. Are there any other resources to help familiarize yourself with hacking concepts/tools? Key word being "familiarize". I've done the lessons, but need reminders before I can fully commit it to memory.
 EDIT: I should mention that I do takes notes as I go through the lessons, and it does help, but it doesn't help me full grasp these concepts when it's just simple tidbits of information

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! As far as I can tell, the Intel C++ compiler, icpx, does not support anything in the <bit> header. Specifically, I'd like to use std::endian in my project. Here is an example that fails with icpx -std=c++23. It works with gcc-13.2.0 and clang-17. It is a bit confusing becasue the compiler uses the GCC library which does support this feature. Feature description and search for std::endian.
 ```
 include <iostream>
 include <bit>
 int main() { std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl; if (std::endian::native == std::endian::big_endian) std::cout << "Native is big endian" << std::endl; else if (std::endian::native == std::endian::little_endian) std::cout << "Native is little endian" << std::endl; } ```
 I'm being pressured by management to use the Intel compiler for "customer support" reasons. But this is a four year old feature that doesn't compile... Is supporting the Intel compiler a bad idea?
 EDIT: Thanks to /u/pdimov2 it seems like this was some sort of an issue with my local compiler as it does work in Godbolt.

 In a few years, I should have the opportunity to change jobs and even accept a lower salary (if needed) and still meet my retirement goals.
 That being said, I'd love to hear from other engineers who have made the same switch.
  
How did you make the transition?
 Did you have any gamedev experience at the time you switched careers?
 Any particular skills you had to pick up before becoming a gamedev? After being a gamedev?
 Would you do it again?
 Did you get a job at an established gamedev company first, or did you go off on your own and start your own thing?
 How much of a hit to your total compensation did you take (if at all)?
 Any advice you could give me or someone in similar shoes?

Is there any open-source limiter that limits, for example, when the response time of a specific endpoint increases beyond some threshold? Or maybe we can hook it up to the metrics of the resource causing the bottleneck (ex: user-info-db-cpu) and decide when to start dropping requests?
 And one additional feature might be: automatically enqueue the requests or convert them to Kafka messages for example? I can consider writing such a service if there is no such thing in the market.

 There is one "top-level" .sln file that will build all the child projects into relevant .lib/.dlls or .exe files. With the final output being a collection of .lib/dll and a few .exe files for deployment.
 I've read that CMakePresets.json should be in the top level, however because I want the ability to build each subproject separately, should I give each a CMakePresets.json?
 Below it a rough project outline I've proposed. Is there a better solution for this project outline?
 Additionally, can a top level CMakePresets.json overwrite children - a Directory.Build.props file in a .sln build system can overwrite child config.

 Everything worked OK (or so it seemed) but when I try compile a simple program like the following:
 import std; 
 int main() {
 std::vector<int> v;
 }
 using xmake with the following setup xmake.lua:
 target("test1") set_kind("binary") set_languages("c++23") set_policy("build.c++.modules", true) 
 I get the following error:
 error: module dependency std required for src/main.cpp not found
 Whereas, everything works ok on my homebrew installed llvm 18.1.5 on an Apple Silicon. What am I missing ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an idea that I have never seen implemented or discussed anywhere and I wonder if it would be possible to do it. I'm not talking about motion interpolation for 2D video which you hear a lot about these days. I'm thinking about calculating extra frames by interpolating the 3D coordinates of triangle vertices to boost the framerate of any 3D game without modding it. Even the 60Hz video output of many game consoles would not be a limit, you could just calculate more frames to reach 144Hz or any value your computer can keep up with.
 One crucial thing that needs to be done for this is to identify which vertex in one frame belongs to which vertex in the next. I don't know how the GPU of consoles usually work with triangles and vertices on a technical level. Maybe the games just send the updated coordinates for each vertex, then it would be easy. If games send completely new triangle information (with color and texture information) every frame, then I guess it would be a lot harder. But I think it should still be possible by using some heuristic that looks at the size, texture and change in position and finds a mapping that results a (approximated) minimal overall change in size and position (and no texture change) of triangles. And if the changes become to big (when an object moves or grows really fast) and the mapping becomes too ambiguous, it would not do the interpolation for the affected triangles. That calculation would of course create a performance overhead but I feel like with modern GPUs it should work for old games.
 I understand that creating 60 fps hacks gives better results and is a cleaner approach, but it has to be done individually for each game and is not trivial and I don't know if you even can go beyond 60 fps with this, so I think it would be nice to have this automatic fps increase option in emulators (or even old non-emulated games) to play everything with 144 fps. What do you think of this idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might be just letting of steam but I'd like to hear how people deal with team members that simply refuse to change. The context is that because of various problems and frustrations in the past, we decided (as a team, where I'm the techical lead) to introduce a new git branching strategy using rebasing. Some team members weren't familiar with this so we had some workshops and I wrote up some detailed documentation and everything seemed good.
 But one developer in particular is basically refusing to change and just does what he used to, so it becomes a hassle for him to clean up his branch when he creates a merge request, and this has to be done for him because he claims that rebasing doesn't work for him and he can't force push, etc. This is in addition to him continuing to complain that the new way is wrong.
 It doesn't help that our project manager is seeing this and is starting to suggest we rethink the strategy if there are so many problems, etc.
 I don't want to get into the pros and cons of the branching strategy, because I don't think that's the underlying problem, but how do you guys deal with stubborn developers like this? Otherwise working with him is great, but this issue is really starting to frustrate everyone.
 Any tips or advice would be more than welcome.

 I am on Windows and I program a little in C.
 I have tried programming in VScode but I didn’t like the extensions and clicking a button to “run” the code without it creating a real executable. Felt like something artificial to me. Also I didn’t find info about how to make it so that you can create an executable (maybe I didn’t search enough).
 So I’ve installed WSL and I’m thinking about writing the code in Notepad++ and then compiling it with gcc in the WSL. It feels to me like I have control over the program that way, in terms of compiling, linking, maybe makefile etc..
 What do you guys think? Where do you work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, I understand money reasons, but hear me out. 
 I see lots of games that are clearly made to be played with friends. But they are also not free games, so if you have a group of, say, 2-3 people you might want to play with, that means you have to get 3 copies... Which now makes the total cost a AAA game. 
 And, depending on who you play with, it might just be a fun few hours and never play it again. 
 But we used to have couch play, so you wouldn't need to buy multiple copies of games, just get one and get your friends to your hause and call it a day. 
 So, wouldn't a game that you could buy and get a few codes to give to your friends, but they can only play the game as long as you are playing the game increase sells? 
 I'm talking from a place of ignorance and just from a place of "wow, that game looks fun, but I can't sink 60 bucks to play it for a few hours". It just seems that could fix that issue and the solution seems to be relatively simple. Get the game on steam, give friends code, friends can now only play if you are in a party with them.

 I use it myself, and it works well for my needs.
 The reason I created it, is because I couldn't find any that were small. For example there is MPI, but it is huge and complex. For certain people (me) this is a problem.
 For example, you might want to create a small program that does a lot of things. If you need to include only a few large components, like a compression lib, a message-passing lib, maybe a XML/JSON parser, and each one takes 1MB, now you have a 3MB program, but your code might only take 50KB. It just seems wrong.
 To many people this isn't an issue, but to some of us, its either something we do for fun, or an obsession. Not sure which. But there can be practical needs too, such as c…]]></summary>

 Because of this, I created pwsh migration script. In this script you perserve issue hierarchy, by your choice with either github beta tasklist or task list. It adds labes based on ado tag and work item type (feature,user story...). 
 It maps users based on github username and ado email which you have to provide as a json format. It save issue state, open or closed. Copies comments to github with metadata.
 Since github issues have 50 000 char limit in issues description, html to md is implemented since work item descriptions in ado are saved as html. This can balloon pretty fast if you have tabels in ado.
 Created github action for this script. Is this something that is needed? Should I publish this on on github marketplace?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right, so I know Qt exists, but I'm not entirely sure how sensible relying on it would be. The key point is that I definitely don't need a gigantic swiss army knife GUI framework, I only need the basic stuff - simple layout, a couple of basic widgets, rudimentary window support. Think basic Win32 - toolbars with buttons, menus, some configuration windows with lists and checkboxes, that sort of stuff. Having "native" looking UI (whatever that means these days) is of no concern.
 The important visual bit of the program is going to be a vector based data visualizer and it needs to be very snappy, have very clean looking rendering and very smooth zooming. That's the most challenging bit, I think. As for basic GUI, I've actually made a basic sketch of a GUI builder of sorts a while ago in Lua (just by relying on the existing pixel drawing function and font rendering) and I didn't find it overly difficult.
 The main issues are that I'm unfamiliar with Cpp (I do have some experience with C, I still remember it fairly well), and I'm going to be developing on Windows while having no idea how much work it'll take to build and distribute it on OSX until I've actually progressed a good deal.
 As far as general GUI multiplatform development goes... I dunno, I've spent a great deal of time researching the subject and it seems that no silver bullet exists, not even remotely. Every option has serious cons and issues. Qt, Java, countless web-based frameworks, and then of course every language has its cons too. For instance, I've been tinkering with Dear PyGui lately (Python bindings for ImGui) and Python doesn't seem to have a good distribution system to end users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I got a tip from a helpful community member that someone on Discord asked him to playtest "his" game. The request came with a link to a Blogspot with only one post, containing a description, screenshots, and download link to the demo.
 The problem? The game in question is mine, and whoever did this is definitely did not have my permission to share it. The entire text of the blog post is 100% copy/pasted from my own website. The copypasted description does include a link to one of my own pages (yeah, how lazy is that?), but otherwise it doesn't credit me as the author or link to me at all.
 Judging from the download size, it looks like this only contains my free, years-old demo with only the first few levels - not the paid package with the whole game.
 So, my questions are:
  
How worried should I be about this? Could this be a threat to my sales or my brand?
 
What actions can I take against this plagiarist?
 
What exactly does the plagiarist stand to game by offering a free game demo and asking random people to "test" something they clearly aren't going to be able to finish?
 
Has this sort of thing happened to anyone else?

I already made a nfc buisness card, and a macropad so I have some experience in pcb design. I was wondering if there were any hacking projects specifically that can be made using pcb designing. It can be illegal but need to be on the gray line between illegal or legal, just like pwnagotchi. Some ideas that I already have is this https://www.hackster.io/pablotrujillojuan/hackbat-1dfdbc, I would be grateful towards anyone's input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been a web developer for the last 5-6 years(mainly frontend, but I worked with Node.js and express for a while). I work for a Big Tech company and I earn a reasonable salary. 
 My problem is I'm exhausted and I feel I can't keep it anymore: We have a lot of strict deadlines and everyone works an unreasonable amount of hours.
 Last Friday, I had to work until 4AM to finish an urgent task that just appeared. This week, I worked 10-12 hours days to finish a bunch of important tasks. I'm not the only one - almost all of my team worked until midnight on tasks and codereviewsw.
 I don't know how to handle this because this is the way we worked for the last 3 years. My manager has very good intentions and he is a technical person, but I feel this is part of the problem.
 Our estimates goes like that: We need to build a popup with some tex and 2 buttons and call an API when "confirm is clicked".
 Me: It will take 3-4 days. Let's say 4 to be safe.
 Manager: 4 days for this ? It's simple enough, should be 2 days at most.
 Me: Yeah, but we want 100% coverage unit tests, use feature flags, the API is not ready yet and we use mock data, 2 people should review the code, we deploy on stage and prod, manual test everything (no QA). We even write e2e tests. 
 In reality, even 4 days is not enough because some things are always unclear, and I have to clarify with 2-3 people and propose solutions. The codebase is very big and a lot of code has been untoched for years etc. So I end up working 12 hours/day to respect even the 4 days estimation, knowing my manager thinks is should be 2, which in fact should probably be 6-8 days because I'm not a robot.
 And I can't continue to work like that. I don't have time for myself, let alone personal development and learning new things.
 I don't know what to do. I talked with my manager a lot, and it's true we managed to complete the task in 4 days, but with me working 12+ hours and going above&beyound for this to happen.

 However, I have an array b of size n, and I would like to modify every value in b, i.e. b[0], b[1], ..., b[n-1].
 Is it safe to do fn(b - 1, n) ;? The reason I am worried is because b - 1 is a completely wild address. b could be the address 1 and b - 1 could be NULL for all I know.
 The function does dereference arr[0]. But still is this safe?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've made plenty of emulators. NES, Apple 2, IBM PC, various others. I never really had that much of a problem getting the graphics to look correct, I even eventually figured out EGA/VGA which was a nightmare. I just can't seem to figure out the correct way to draw Pac-Man though! (Testing with Midway arcade ROMs)
 I'm getting the tile data. If I use the two bits per pixel I get from character ROM and just treat that as a grayscale image, I get a totally recognizable display! I see the words on the title screen, I see the maze. That part's working.
  charval = ROM_gfx[val * 16 + idx]; pixel[0] = (charval & 0x01) | ((charval & 0x10) >> 3); pixel[1] = ((charval & 0x02) >> 2) | ((charval & 0x20) >> 4); pixel[2] = ((charval & 0x04) >> 3) | ((charval & 0x40) >> 5); pixel[3] = ((charval & 0x08) >> 4) | ((charval & 0x80) >> 6); 
 Where val is a byte out of the char RAM and ROM_gfx[] is the character ROM array. No problem!
 But what's the correct way to get the full color? There's color RAM just above char RAM. I believe I'm supposed to use the same offset in there for the tile as I do for the char RAM. Then left shift it by 2 and OR the values from the pixel array above?
 Then there's a color ROM and a palette ROM. I thought I was supposed to index palette ROM from the result I got from the above, and then I use that value to index the color ROM which gives me the RGB values?
 That's what I'm trying, and it just looks like a mess. Completely wrong.
 What am I missing? I thought this one would be simple lol. I can't seem to find a clear explanation anywhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I've been weighing my options lately and could really use some advice. I'm stuck between pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity or Computer Science. Money is a big concern for me, especially since my dad is retiring soon leaving me in-charge of being the breadwinner of the family, taking care of both my parents and my sibling who will at one point sooner or later also be going to university...
 Here's the deal: I'm not exactly a math whiz, and the thought of getting tangled up in complex equations in a CS program is daunting. I've heard that Cybersecurity might be a bit lighter on the math, which sounds like a relief.
 But I also want to make sure I'm setting myself up for a solid career path with good job prospects and financial stability on a global scale. So, which field do you think offers a more secure role and better opportunities in the long run?
 Any insights or experiences you can share would be super helpful. Thanks in advance for your input!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all...want to hear some outside advice from people in a bunch of tech subs. 
 I'm in a predicament here. I am currently a junior sysadmin. I just got offered a 60% increase from my current salary at another company. 
 My thing is, I will most likely be learning less stuff at the new job, with not as many tools to play it, and will probably stunt my learning growth with on the job stuff. I would need to work very hard off the clock to keep up with skills and learning new ones, especially if I want to go higher than sysadmin (which I want to do asap).
 Current job, I get underpaid. Im salary and still put in 12 hour days pretty much all the time. I knew that once I took the promotion to junior sysadmin. But saying that, this is a much bigger company that i currently work for, with more access to new tools, more projects, stuff of that nature, so im nervous that I wont be learning as much at the new place than now. 
 I would like to move up to Cloud engineer, and eventually hopefully a devops role if im lucky and work hard enough.
 What do you guys think? Stay? Or go? Obviously the $$$ will help me out TREMENDOUSLY, but I am super worried about plateauing at the new job quickly.
 Whoever reads this, thank you very much for taking ur time to read it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Currently I am working on creating my own custom hashmap implementation. I am also comparing the performance of my implementation against the performance of the ktprime "emhash8" hashmap. Currently, when I test both hashmaps with google's benchmarks library, it shows that my hashmap design is extremely slow, nearly 3 times slower than emhash8 and significantly slower than std::unordered_map , however, when I test all 3 hashmaps CLion's integrated profiler, it shows that my hashmap is faster than the other 2 hashmaps. I initially assumed this was because I ran my hashmap first when I tested with CLions profiler, but the changing the order of the benchmarks doesn't appear to effect the performance. I am not sure which performance metric I should follow here.

 The company wears as a point of pride how many acronyms they use, and people just seem to know what everything stands for because many of them have 20 years at this company or in this industry.
 I've asked for help and was given a few docs that define some of the terms (including a glossary of 600+ company acronyms that still fails to define many of the ones I encounter). How am I supposed to follow along on a Teams call where every sentence has two new acronyms to look up?
 Is this a normal experience at every big company?

 there is an optional attr in the end of some productions, but the documentation doesn't clarify what those are. I don't believe : private is an attribute because the doc doesn't say so and it has its own production.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a server. It need some memory pool that will have spike usage:
 Suppose I allocate 16 GB using mmap. This memory will be not mapped to physical memory until I use it. So let say I begin to use it. Memory pages will be mapped to physical memory, but if I use say 100 mb, only 100 mb will be mapped. 
 Most of the time, 100-200 kb will be used.
 From time to time, the server will need more spike memory, say 11 GB.
 After finishing the workload, I do not need any of this memory.
 Then is a good idea, this memory to be returned to the OS.
 I know this can be done with munmap(). However this suppose to be slow.
 Question is can I do this using madvice(), but in such way, so I will be able to privide the memory again for the next spike?
 Second part of the question, I did some test program, but found is difficult to debug, since both top and pmap give me full amount of virtual memory and not show ammount of mapped pages to physical memory (or maybe I am testing it incorrectly)

The company, A, is pretty big and somewhat regularly acquires other smaller companies and their software. Around a year ago our team randomly received meeting invites to “new hire onboarding” sessions for a much smaller company we had acquired, B. But the thing is the communication from leadership was basically non-existent as to what expectations are and what direction we were heading in.
 This was literally the first we ever heard of it. My manager didn’t even know this was happening at the time or what company B was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm working on adding audio support into my GB emulator, using SDL as the backend. So far it's working with the following audio spec:
 SDL_AudioSpec specification = { .freq = DMGL_AUDIO_SAMPLES * 60, .format = AUDIO_F32, .channels = 1, .samples = DMGL_AUDIO_SAMPLES, };
 However, the audio gets out of sync with the video frames over time and I'm not sure why. If I change the channel count to 2, it stays in-sync, but with gaps in the audio stream because I'm generating mono audio samples. Changing the channel count to 2 an then generating seperate left/right samples reintroduces the sync issue.
 Has anyone seen this before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was surprised to see that the set_low() and set_high() functions in the nrf_hal return a Result type since flipping a register bit seems like a infallible operation. When I looked at the source code, I found this:
 fn set_low(&mut self) -> Result<(), Self::Error> { unsafe { self.block().outclr.write(|w| w.bits(1u32 << self.pin())); } Ok(()) } 
 This seems to me like infallible code that can only return Ok(()). 
 So why would they choose to have it return a Result type? It only seems to be an annoyance since you have to handle the return type by either unwrapping it or assigning it.

The top 30 one has greater national name recognition and cheaper, but the top 100 is smaller, in my hometown, and I think is more student-oriented? Let me know what you guys think.
 Edit: Also, they’re not just any random schools I chose. Both are heavily tech-oriented, just to add context. One is well-known nationally, the other is well-known regionally and maybe semi-nationally.

 Demo Content
 The game is a hybrid action RPG and bullet hell. The demo features three characters and one main infinitely-generated area with 3 bosses. It also includes a sort of prototype infinite scaling endgame for players who have gotten through all of the existing demo content. 
 The demo focuses heavily on loot. Players find randomly generated items with up to 6 modifiers from a pool of potentially hundreds of mods, and can craft those items with really wacky crafting tools in order to gain exponential increases in power.

 First off, I want to thank this community for the incredible response and feedback I received when I first shared about PicoUSB. Your insights and suggestions have been invaluable in shaping the development of this project.
 Since then, I've been hard at work refining PicoUSB to make it even easier to produce and ship. I'm incredibly excited about the progress We've made with PicoUSB. We are now at final Version: V0.6. As always, I welcome your thoughts, feedback, and suggestions as we continue to evolve and improve PicoUSB.

 Background:
 I am new to penetration testing/hacking etc. I've been interested in the field of computers for long, and know basic Python, Java, etc. A short while ago my spare PC's windows did not boot up properly, so I messed around with it and remembered how much I enjoy understanding systems etc. which lead to rediscovering my interest in hacking, cybersecurity, etc.
 Anyway, I am looking for good learning materials, but I am not sure whether books are worth while or if it is better to learn directly from the internet. I usually prefer books, but I also know the world of computing advances fast. 
 My question:
 Are there good books/youtube etc. accounts/websites you would suggest to a beginner?
 Thanks for taking the time to read and respond, I appreciate it.

And to make matters worse it seems like lately each new task is in a repo you haven’t worked in before and the changes being requested are not small changes.
 I assume you all just do what you can but if something doesn’t get done then don’t worry about it? Just curious to hear if any others are in this situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The current issue I am facing is learning to "scale through others". I can handle the technical stuff, I can figure out solutions and paths to complex problems and code them, or if I can't, I know how to find the right people and the right knowledge to see my project through.
 The problem is that there are only so many things one can do, eventually, if the task is monumental, you become a bottle neck. This is where this whole "scaling through others" comes in.
 A good "senior" or "lead engineer" is a force multiplier greater than 1. A bad one is a bottle neck.
 So I was in the unfortunate situation where i had to lead a team who overall lacked the right kind of skillset for what the project demanded. We did deliver on time, but it was very stressful for me, and there's still a lot of things that need to be refined yet. 
 So I guess the question is, how do help your team deliver when they lack a lot of the basics for the given domain? My team was mostly backend and infrastructure engineers, and they now need to work on something related to compilers and software analysis.
 Had it been just me, the project would have taken a month, but with a team it took 4 times longer, and there's still too much friction in certain areas. Granted long term there are 5 engineers who can work on it vs 1, which is positive, but still, it was a struggle.
 I have the hunch that building a core / skeleton and then having people explore / solve isolated problems is the right way to go, but then people find excuses or avoid diving in the codebase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently restructuring my Terraform configuration within a mono-repo to streamline our CI/CD process across multiple environments (test, staging, prod). The goal is to efficiently manage infrastructure provisioning and updates for three distinct applications with (almost) distinct infrastructure residing in separate resource groups in Azure.
 Currently our Terraform configuration resided in one main.tf file.. which is realllly big and annoying to manage.
 I want to split it into environments and modules so i can spin up test infrastructure upon opening a PR for the specific app that has been changed.
 Is it a bad practice to for example structure my terraform dir like this:
 ├───modules │ ├───app1 │ ├───app2 │ ├───app3 └───environments ├───prod ├───staging └───test 
 Because if i read Hashicorp documentation correctly, i feel like they recommended this approach:
 ├───modules │ ├───App1 │ │ ├───postgres.tf │ │ ├───keyvault.tf │ │ ├───servicebus.tf │ │ └───fucnctionapp.tf │ │ └───... │ ├───App2 │ └───App3 └───environments ├───prod ├───staging └───test 
 But i feel like the problem i will be facing if i do this, is that i either end up with a environment directory for each individual app, so prod-app1, stag-app1, test-app1, prod-app2, etc.
 Or i will have to provision all of the apps, for a change to 1 app.
 But i agree with Hashicorp, that in most situations the second approach seems much more scalable and better to manage as your infrastructure grows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am updating a very old C codebase to a modern C++ approach. But this process is not straightforward. This means I cannot transform the C code right away into modern C++ with unit tests and all the code quality tools I would like.
 As long as I'm grooming it up, I tend to make mistakes. Namely I refactor the code before I functionally replace the old code with a modern C++ approach. For instance, I replace statements like
 anOldCStruct->memberfield->memberfield2->value = x; anOldCStruct->memberfield->memberfield2->value2 = y; anOldCStruct->memberfield->memberfield2->value3 = z; 
 into 
 auto* memberfield2 = anOldCStruct->memberfield->memberfield2; memberfield2->value = x; memberfield2->value2 = y; memberfield2->value3 = z; 
 but I run into problems with boolean variables, as I mistakenly remove negative logic ! without noticing. We have pull requests and these mistakes are also not detected, so double human problem here.
 That's why I'm asking this: before I can go full unit testing, does anybody know if there's any tool that can detect from git commit to git commit the change of boolean logic that it's "easy" to miss if you're a human but not if you're a computer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clang, GCC and MSVC appear to disagree on how to handle potential "shadowing" of parameter pack names by dependent types:
 https://godbolt.org/z/PTne4M3oq
 Now, this is the sort of issue that can be easily avoided by using names that do not clash (or writing some wrapper that exposes the dependent type with another name), but I cannot, for the life of me, figure out which compiler, if any, is right according to the standard (so that the bug can be properly reported).
 I would say Clang handles everything according to my intuitive expectations, but I recognize the possibility that it is simply being overly generous with what it accepts. EDIT: EDG also has this behaviour.
 (I realize there is some overlap with /r/cpp_questions since this is technically a question about C++, but, as it has mostly to do with what appears to be an edge case in the standard and its handling by different compilers, I felt it was more appropriate to ask here.)

If I give them a new feature, where the ticket outlines exactly what they need to do, then they can do it no issues. But if I give them a ticket that is "figure out why this is broken" they end up going around in circles for days and making no progress.
 Whatever this skill set is comes very easily and naturally to me, so I'm a bit confused as I assumed it was the same for every developer, but I guess not.
 Its not a knowledge or domain knowledge issue, as right now they are stuck fixing a bug on part of the system they worked heavily on six weeks ago.
 So my question is, what skill is this person missing and what's the best way to learn it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I'm planning on writing a filemodd as my second project in C, so experience is still lacking. I've been reading a lot about file system events [ linux ] and came across Inotify for monitoring file system events. However, I would like to watch and keep track of which process accesses a file being watched. Is this possible without reading the proc fs? I've came across (process control block) PSB, is it possible to read the PCB of a system in user mode without root access?
 NB: Thank you, and I'll be more than grateful if you can point me to right resources!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 95% of cases, needing a process manager, or an init, in a Docker container is an anti-pattern. One container, one application, this is the way.
 However, for the remaining 5%, sometimes, an application can be multiple processes. When that is the case, it can become challenging to manage those processes within a Docker image.
 Usually, I would use a tool like supervisord. But as I was forwarding the container's output (stdout/stderr) to syslog, there was no way to easily filter the logs of each process.
 This is why I took some time to implement procfusion. Just a TOML file to specify the commands to launch, and voilà!
 procfusion is a static Rust binary, ideal for your Docker images that are FROM scratch. No dependency on a shell required.
 I know other solutions exists, if you click the link to the Github repository, there is a small comparison with other tools.
 Feedback would be greatly appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to programming, and projects/tools provided with CMake files are stumping me.
 I've figured out some Lua, python, and Arduino (AFAIU basically modified C++ with a special IDE). With those the process of using source code is relatively simple even with limited understanding, either:
  
Set up dev environment, troubleshoot environmental variables and dependencies, then run some compile command in terminal (my Lua experience);
 Choose directory and copy-paste a command to terminal (my python experience); or
 Open the source with an IDE and use built-in tools to upload to device (my Arduino experience).
  
With CMake, even the official "Basic Starting Point" is a multi-step process filled with concepts I don't understand, which doesn't end in me being able to build someone else's CMake project. Almost everything I read (example) says "I know you're on Windows/OSX, but this is how it works in linux..." and is targeting people developing their own projects.
 A lot of the projects I find provided as CMake directories aren't significantly more complex than projects I successfully use in other formats. I'm talking platform-specific emulators, image conversion tools, etc. Is there any way for a beginner like me to use these, or do I just need to skip them until I've learned a lot more?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context was similar to GDPR, in that after 5 years, apart from back ups, all data relating to an event should disappear. Ie. hard deletion from persistent storage. Now this sounds simple enough: All records in a set of known tables (ie our event tables) with timestamp age > 5 years should be hard deleted. Plus any associated blob storage NoSQL dbs as well (using ids from the relational database). Let's ignore the implications of distributed systems and stay solely within a singular db.
 The tricky part was, how do you stop engineers submitting code that breaks this rule? For a more concrete example, a dev adds a new or modifies an existing sql table FOO with no foreign key to the previously concerned tables, but on event creation, FOO will now have some event related data (possibly transformed/hashed so it's completely unrecogniseable from original event data, but must still be deleted)?
 It's simple to say Code Review, but I'm looking for basically as robust a solution here, preferably as part of the CI pipeline (eg github actions). Here are some things I thought of, but kind of got stumped towards the end when data can't be recognised.
  
Static Analysis to recognise new tables -> code review carefully
 Static Analysis to see if the inputs, are eventually used on any tables not in an existing 'vetted' list (I assume this is possible)
 Stand up a db via docker, then see what tables change when an event is created, if not on a vetted list, alert. This might be through inspection of logs, or using some Change Data Capture lib to help.
  
I really liked the last one, but maybe there's some fundamental stuff I'm missing. Any one want to pitch in?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And finally I got a demo on Steam.
 A little context
 About two years ago I decided to try making a game. It was decided to do a small, but not entirely microscopic project that would bring me satisfaction from its implementation.
 So, throughout these two years, as development progressed, I acquired and improved my skills in order to create something useful. I’m not sure that I expected to do everything much faster, I don’t even remember my initial plans and deadlines, but I already registered the game at 3 demo festivals and successfully canceled the registration, deciding that I could do better. And finally the demo appeared where I had long wanted to see it.
 What is the game about?
 “Defeat/beat people” was conceived as a mixture of tabletop warhammer (in terms of scale it turned out to be more of a kill team offshoot), Xcom and Battle brothers. Naturally, not the ultimate version, but what I can put together on my own, trying to isolate what I like about these games.
 In concept, this is a fairly simple turn-based tactics, without overload with numbers, with customization of units and quick battles that affect the balance of forces within the star system.
 Most of the game was made by me alone. My girlfriend helped with the music, and she has been putting up with this development with me from the very beginning. I was also helped by several people who tested the game and caught bugs when I was no longer physically able to sit at the computer.
 There is still a lot of work ahead. I hope to complete the full version of the game within a few months, but so far the actual development time has always been several times longer than planned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 Novice to C++ here, trying to work with a situation where there are two objects of the same class on the heap. I want to have one of them as the "currently selected" version via its pointer so that methods can be called and variables edited through its methods. With the approach I'm trying If the currently selected object is changed, it seems like any edits made are not kept in memory.
 As an example, the below code (in my mind) should allow the user to swap between two "Fruit" objects which exist on the heap, prompting the user to change the color of the currently selected fruit and automatically swap to the other.
 When I call setColor("green") on apple, after swapping the currentFruit from banana back to apple again if I call getColor() on apple it returns "red", which doesn't make sense to me,
 How can you keep a “Fruit” object in memory that remembers its variables have been changed? Or does this question not make sense in this language and is this approach fundamentally wrong?
 #include <iostream> #include <string> using namespace std; class Fruit { string name; string color; public: Fruit (string n, string c) { setName(n); setColor(c); }; void setName(string s) {name = s; return;}; string getName() {return name;}; void setColor(string s) {color = s; return;}; string getColor() {return color;}; }; Fruit* a = new Fruit("apple", "red"); Fruit* b = new Fruit("banana", "yellow"); int main() { Fruit currentFruit = (*a); bool keepGoing = true; while (keepGoing) { cout << "\nthe current fruit is " << currentFruit.getName() << endl; cout << "\nit is " << currentFruit.getColor() << endl; string newColor; cin >> newColor; currentFruit.setColor(newColor); cout << "\nokay, now "<< currentFruit.getName() << " is "; cout << currentFruit.getColor() << endl; if (currentFruit.getName() == "apple") { currentFruit = (*b); } else { currentFruit = (*a); } } return 0; }

 As you may know, the tech industry has been undergoing significant layoffs in the past couple of years. While you might think it's exclusively because of interest rates, a relatively unknown factor contributing to this crisis is Section 174 of the US tax code.
 What’s Section 174?
 Before 2022, Section 174 allowed companies to fully deduct research and development (R&D) expenses, including software engineer salaries, in the year they were incurred. This incentivized innovation and fueled the rapid growth of tech startups. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 changed the game, which went into effect in 2022. It mandated that domestic R&D expenses be spread over 5 years, significantly incre…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I've been working on open source SDKs for Android and iOS that export OpenTelemetry signals. I'm really excited about this because observability SDKs have traditionally used proprietary schemas, making it hard to export and analyze production data.
 Our mobile-native SDKs use OpenTelemetry Traces and Logs, and capture mobile-specific signals such as network requests, status codes, screen views, error logs, crashes, and more.
 Here’s our github repo: https://github.com/embrace-io
 You can use a generic OTel exporter to send mobile telemetry captured by our SDK to any OTel backend like Jaeger, Zipkin, or Grafana, or send it to Embrace itself. Plus, we’re enabling mobile teams to instrument any software component or service using OpenTelemetry and gather the data in the Embrace backend. This data can be visualized and live alongside data captured by first-party solutions.
 Full disclosure: I work for Embrace.io but would really appreciate your thoughts and feedback

For instance being able to rename certain kind of variables to change the naming convention, updating comments, doing custom rule checks. No matter how complex it is to write the rules, but then the process should be automatic for all the files. 
 I saw some papers about tools used by Google, but no "almost-ready" solution. 
 I was hoping about something based on clang. Suggestions? Using msvc or clangcl atm. 
 I guess in the future we'll have AI to do these things , but we are not there yet...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in FAANG, have almost 5 yoe now. And although I’m confident about my coding abilities, I still feel this with every new project or crash/bug I get assigned.
 I don’t know if it’s imposter syndrome. Basically, it’s hard for me to not feel stressed about the task until I have a plan of action. What this means is that I stay up late until I figure out the puzzle - like what classes I can reference to build this feature, or potential root causes for the crash that I can test out tomorrow. 
 But it’s hard for me to “clock out” mentally from work if I am left with a problem I have no immediate plan of action/solutions for. 
 Has anyone else experienced this? Curious to know if this is a type of imposter syndrome and how to deal with it.

 Is YouTube’s algorithm just letting me down or are all the C videos on that platform really just tutorials for beginners or videos asking if C is obsolete?
 If anyone knows of any channels like the Coding Train but using C, so I don’t have to subject myself to JavaScript, I’d be most grateful for a recommendation.

It is a game inpired by YouTube videos of how people save different animals like Seals tangled in fishnets. I watch Captain Planet as a kid, I was a boy-scout and topic of nature preservation is important to me but I wouldn't call myself an activist and my priority is to make this game fun. I setup Steam page and I gather Wishlists. I don't have marketing budget so I post about my game on various social medias. Most of the times feedback is positive but there are some people who really don't like the idea. But not only that. They call me "leftist r*tard" "NWO shill" and "pinkhair soyboy". Someone even suggested that I should make "H*mas t*rrorist Simulator" next. I don't take those words lightly. All I wanted is to make a game about rescuing animals, I wouldn't in a million years assume that this will be controversial.

 I know the market is worse than normal, but it feels like there's not really a good fit for my exact level of experience. 
 While at my last job I was just as productive if not more productive at pumping out code than the senior devs, I don't really feel 'ready' yet in terms of architectural design and best practices to consider myself senior. All the senior roles are asking for 5-8 YOE anyway which seem to be the majority of positions, and the junior roles seem to be mostly looking for freshers. 
 Got rejected from a few senior roles because I just didn't have the years. Understandable have a nice day. Got rejected from a junior role because the hiring manager said something along the lines of they were "seeking candidates who are at an earlier stage in their career and can grow alongside our team". I understand that you don't want to hire someone overqualified because they might leave soon but what the fuck. 
 Is there some secret word I need to type into Indeed to find the jobs which take people with 2 years of experience? Because I'm apparently too young to be considered senior and too old to be junior.

 (TeaScript is a standalone as well as an embeddable multi-paradigm script language in and for C++.)
 All details to this release can be found in the blog post:
 https://tea-age.solutions/2024/05/15/release-of-teascript-0-14-0/
 Summary of this Release
  
(automatically) compile and execute TeaScript files in the new integrated Tea StackVM.
 Save and Load compiled TeaScript programs as TeaScript Binary files (*.tsb).
 Suspend and Continue TeaScript programs at (nearly) any time by either themselves, by maximum time or instruction constraint or by an external request from another thread.
 Use TeaScript code similar like a coroutine in your C++ Application by yielding values from any place and co-operative / preemptive execution possibilities.
 Nerd feature: program directly in TeaScript Assembly.
 improved debugging capabilities with single stepping, view the callstack, view corresponding source code and more.
 Opt-out header only library usage for save includes and compile time.
  
The TeaScript C++ Library is also on Github:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Preface: I am a complete noob.
 With the move to kubernetes/microservices/containerization why aren't languages that use BEAM more popular? I can understand the desire to make services language agnostic for a number of good reasons, but to me personally that doesn't seem worth the tradeoff of managing a glut of different tools to accomplish essentially the same goal. I haven't invested the time to delve into erlang/gleam/elixir too deeply, but from the outside it appears that concurrency is handled leagues above what is possible with kubernetes. I will still take the time to learn each approach, but I am very curious what everyone else thinks about this.
 Edit: BEAM) is the Virtual Machine associated with Erlang and similar languages

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created a simple REPL in C that reads a line of input and prints it back, while saving the history of inputs entered by the user. Before you judge me as a noob (I don't mind that tbh), listen.
 Why create a stupid REPL?
 Well, creating a basic REPL that reads input until the user hits ENTER is straightforward. However, allowing the user to navigate through input history with the UP and DOWN arrow keys is more challenging because:
  
Immediate Input Handling: You don't get what the user typed until they hit ENTER. This is problematic because users expect the previous command to be displayed immediately upon pressing the UP arrow key.
 Raw Mode and Escape Sequences: To handle user input on each key press, the terminal input must be in raw mode. And once you're in raw mode, say bye bye to the default behavior of the terminal like CTRL+C to exit, CTRL+D to send EOF, or something as simple as backspace handling. You have to handle all of these manually. In fact, you have to responsible for writing back the character that the user types to the terminal.
  
You can read more about raw mode and escape sequences in my notes:
  
Raw mode: https://github.com/biraj21/echo-repl/blob/main/notes/raw-mode.md
 Escape sequences: https://github.com/biraj21/echo-repl/blob/main/notes/escape-sequences.md
  
Btw this stupid REPL is roughly 500 lines of (probably buggy) code!
 Source code: https://github.com/biraj21/echo-repl
 Please go through the README once to understand the behaviour of history in this implementation.
 Motivation? Needed it to follow https://buildyourownlisp.com/ book, and I was unable to build the library suggested there on my Mac.
 Would appreciate your feedback. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently found a bit of a growing bottleneck in our multi-tenant architecture. At the basic level, our multi-tenant system is event-driven and user code can dynamically create event-matching expressions at runtime that need to be evaluated on all incoming events in our event stream. We recently made some big optimizations for matching by turning expressions into ASTs then moving the expressions themselves into in-memory hash maps using xxhash for string matches and btree (shout out to `tidwall/btree`) for number matching and comparison. 
 We thought it was an interesting problem, so I came to share our code and the blog post with more info on how we solved it. Anyone else have any experience with something like this? Something we can improve or do better?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was put on a 60-day PIP at the start of this month for poor performance. I already had documented performance problems and was told that my Python coding skills are inadequete for this job. I am still on my second 3-month trial period because at the end of my first trial period, my manager decided to extend it by 3 months instead of firing me. However, I still ended up getting PIP'd. 
 So my question is: is a PIP considered to be "the end"? I should also mention that my performance goals are to have clean, optimized code (specifically looking at its performance) and not miss any deadlines (we consider the end of a 2-week sprint a "hard deadline".

 Of course, following best practices, we will not be giving him admin access. 
 How do you suggest going about this?
 From prior research, I may do RBAC. AWS Managed policies are too permissive, but what about implementing Customer Managed Policies? Am I in the ballpark? Or not even close?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I first started learning go, I was initially confused by "interface" in go. Like, when I explored the codebase in my company, it was used as something that interface isn't supposed to be. 
 It was after a while I realized interface could also be used as any data type. It was also when I realized go has any data type. 
 But why this way? Why did they have to call any as "interface"? Why didn't they just call it any straight away? 
 I'm also aware at the fact that now go has introduced "any" as any along with generics feature. But iirc it's just an alias of "interface" data type. And I feel lots of devs still prefer to use "interface" instead of "any" to declare the any data type.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I am an asian and English is my second language. Currently working in Australia as a software developer with a 12 years of experience.
 I've already opened up this issue with my TL and CTO during our 1:1 and was told they understand me just fine and that they're happy that I do my job really well, however, I feel it still holds me back to become better at what I do.
 Here are the problems: 1. Collaborating with others - Internally, I understand what the block of code does and what it is for. I don't have any issues communicating this in slack because I get more time to format what I need to say and also use chatGPT to polish it so I can express it more clearly. However, I struggle to verbalise it when I am in the office because I was being conscious with my grammar and the way I speak, sometimes I would overexplain myself to a point I don't understand what I am saying anymore and get lost.
  
Visualising concepts - I struggle to understand what my teammate is saying if I don't have any previous knowledge to it. I feel like I am stupid and wasting their time asking to explain again for me to understand and still don't understand a thing. Furthermore, I don't know what questions to asks so I could at least contribute in our discussion.
  
Anyone have the same experiene and how did you overcome it? I am attending a toastmaster at the end of this month hopinh it would help me.

 Screenshot of what the issue looks like: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/756550550279028737/1240234870731571261/image.png?ex=6645d23b&is=664480bb&hm=ffda7ade3a6be63b65eae24a3fd09f527b511931c2bd89f38e5df9c18c82202c&
 I'm using ImGui docking and I'm trying to get this window on the right (the one that says "Keys Down") to have a transparent background with just the text overlaying the screen. All of the appropriate flags for the window are enabled, no title bar, no decorations and no background. As a result, as long as the window is within the bounds of the main window of the app, it appears as just text without a background, just how I intended.
 However, as soon as I try to drag this window outside the bounds of the main viewport, the dock gets a black background that I don't want there. Does anyone know what might be causing this and how to fix it? I'm rendering this using DirectX10 in case it matters.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, coding newbie here,
 I've recently started learning Rust, mainly because a) it looks more fun than R (is R even considered a programming language? idk) which I begrudgingly use everyday and b) It seems like Rust's main focus is to minimize memory issues during runtime, which is of great interest to me. Right now I'm reading the Rust Book and having a lot of fun, but I know to truly step up my game I need to do a personal project.
 Thing is, I don't know what to do. I came across a random comment from a different subreddit talking about their setup, and it seemed like they made their own music player (I'm not sure if this is the correct term, what I mean is programs like foobar2000, itunes, etc), and that caught my eye. I like music, and I've never had a music player that perfectly suits my needs, so I think it'll be a pretty fun challenge to make one myself, but I'm not sure if it's going to be too hard for me.
 I pretty much have absolutely no coding experience. Yes, I've said I used C/C++ before, and because of my line of work requires some knowledge of Python I learned that as well, but I only know them at a surface level. So going back to the question - Will making a music player be too hard for me? Should I do something simpler first?
 Thanks!

 As long of course the project doesn't have specific constraints (if it needs speed, maybe hashtables for quick insertion, deletion, lookup using std::unordered_map would be a better choice, maybe if we need something with less memory overhead and won't do dynamic allocation, maybe going for std::arrays etc etc)
 It's an honest question since I'm hearing a lot from programmers (Even Bjarne Stroustrup says its a good default unless you have reason not to) that they mostly use vectors in C++ for all types of applications because they're so powerful. 
 Thanks

 I've worked just over 18 months in a team lead position at a prestigious tech company, and despite making more money than ever, it has been the worst 18 months of my life mentally, and it's reached a point where I feel physically sick 24/7. I think I flew too close to the sun making this career move, I don't think I'm cutout for the rapid context switching, people management, meetings, and endless Slack messages. I just want to code again. I'm worried that people will perceive me as a failure for giving up, and that I'm an idiot for walking away from a high paying job at a prestigious company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I take my notes in plain markdown using NeoVim, and I wanted preview the files directly in the terminal. NeoVim itself works, but it wasn't "pretty" enough. I tried Glow, but following links didn't work as I wanted. So I created MD-TUI. It has a file browser which finds all markdown files recursively. Optionally use gitignore to filter out some.
 I decided to write my own grammar for the markdown language, so it does not follow a specification 100%, but create an issue if you feel like it doesn't parse something correctly. Most of the common markdown syntax should be supported.
 If your terminal support some image protocol, it can also display images. Syntax highlighting is supported for some languages, and I am adding more as we speak.
 The biggest feature I have not seen other do, is a "select link" mode which allows you to scroll through the links in the file and follow them. Does not matter if it's a link to a heading, another file, or external URL to a website.
 Would be awesome to hear your thoughts.
 Edit: should have said it does not follow a specification 100%

Let me give you a bit of background: I'm a student currently studying computer science at university. I have this C++ project that I've recently been working on, and I'm using Qt for its interface. It's basically an application that helps you organize files. I'm wondering if any of you would be willing to help me enhance and improve my program to make it more user-friendly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I graduated last May with my Bachelors in Management Information Systems with a focus on Technology and Management. Post graduation I didn’t have anything lined up, so during the summer I worked as a bag boy at a local golf course, then eventually went back to a broker I interned for to work as an office assistant part time all while I continued to job search. Sent out hundreds of applications and got interviews here and there, but no luck getting hired. It was honestly such a draining experience. I couldn’t even get hired for a position paying 45-50k a year and a lot of them were customer service based roles, very entry level. Fast forward to now, I got hired to be an ‘engineer’ but the role is more so a project management role. Absolutely no experience in the field and they are willing to train me. One thing I learned about obtaining a job is it’s all about who you know and if the timing is right. The guy whos position I am taking over got promoted and I happen to know someone within the company which definitely helped. One in-person interview and three weeks later they sent me an offer, which definitely caught me off guard. Nervous to start to say the least, but definitely excited and motivated to get my professional career underway. Wish me luck!

 So if you are struggling with LC just stick with it. I guarantee you it's not an intelligence thing. Several Meta employees have confirmed they basically just memorized the top tagged Meta LC list. These people are not high iq geniuses. If you need to memorize or do the same top tagged problems over and over then do so. Some companies , cough...Meta, expect you regurgitate answers anyways so don't feel guilty or shame with having to memorize answers for the most common LC hards asked in interviews.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you know, one of the main gripes with C++ development is related to compilation time. Compiler vendors constantly strive to make improvements in this area, in spite of new STL features being constantly added. C++26 is going to be quite special in this regard though afaik, having the reflections proposal accepted. Reflections being probably the biggest metaprogramming extensions ever added to the language, even bigger than concepts and require clauses.
 I'm saying this because I was watching this particular talk by Alexander Fokin describing it: https://youtu.be/FqzrQf6Xr8g?si=oe6L0askoOzQjSlC&t=3592 . What immediately caught my attention was the example of how you could implement std::tuple (almost fully) in what? 20 lines of code? For reference, MSVC's implementation is a header with more than 1000 lines of code ( https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/main/stl/inc/tuple ), containing dozens of helper class template instantiated for each instance of std::tuple used in real code. A fair assumption would be that the std::meta version would be far faster to compile, reflections being a very straight-forward way of expressing your intent to the compiler. In real life scenarios this could results in an immense amount of time saved at compilation time. And better yet, the opportunity of rewritting std::tuple would be a big bonus too since none of the standard implementations are optimal ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ilujab/it_turns_out_stdtuple_is_not_a_zerocost/ ).
 Again, I'm not talking just about std::tuple here, I'm assuming there are dozens of STL components that could use being rewritten using reflections, if for nothing else, at least for the sake of compilation time. I'm wondering if this new feature couldn't be the push vendors have needed to take into consideration a real ABI break with one of their future releases, considering the compilation time improvements now available on the table.

 I’ve caught myself playing quite a few hours and I genuinely enjoy my game. But it makes me wonder if I am not being delusional in my enjoyment. So what makes you go: I have a good game loop?
 Play testers seemed to have greatly enjoyed the game but I worry the sample size is too small.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretty much all in the title, I'm a senior dev working on a small team with one other senior dev (just the two of us) and I opened a PR to fix a small bug. My coworker reviewed the PR, blocking it by requesting changes and shortly after opened their own PR fixing the same bug, requesting my review.
 Both PRs fix the bug and are technically correct, just do so in different ways. 
 I feel like this is bad etiquette and am wondering the best way to handle this situation. Its the first time I find myself in this specific situation with this dev, although I will note that they are somewhat opinionated and can sometimes be difficult to work with, but thats normal. Just looking for opinions on if I'm being too sensitive and how I should tackle this situation, if at all.

 In other words and in a more serious tone: is there a "best" general-purpose C++ primitives library that could theoretically become "the new stdlib", if we could magically disregard all existing code?
 Or in yet other words: is there a library, or a set of libraries, that I should seriously consider using instead of stdlib and STL (on performance, ergonomics and usability grounds) in new projects where backward compatibility and simplicity of deployment is not a concern?

I pass that, so I assumed I would go to the tech screen next. A week passes and the recruiter finally sends me an email telling me I need to "continue developing my skills" and no feedback. Their auto-email also mentions that I have a 6-9month reapply waiting period. I'm fine getting denied, but don't tell me to improve my skills when you reached out to me and I haven't even done the interview yet...
 It is insane that some recruiters hold the entry door for some of the highest paying jobs in our field. Guess I now have a re-apply waiting period due to a bad recruiter. 
 P.S> Seems like Big G is even outsourcing recruitment to outside the US. Avoid these recruiters if you don't want to get screwed for no reason.

 Although not directly related to Rust, the concepts approached here showcase some amazing patterns that I would love to see be possible in Rust.
 There has also been some discussion of "Must-Move Types", which can't be dropped.
 To me, the patterns of "Cache Tokens", and "Owned Indexes" are absurdly awesome!
 Tbh, just the idea of having destructors that can take parameters and return values is insane.
 But, like any awesome feature, it has its drawbacks... What do you guys think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 My first job out of college has primarily involved writing code that runs in a real time Linux environment. The code I've written wasn't the kind that focused on being ultra optimized. Instead, the focus was moreso on readability and reliability. We usually are not allowed to use most modern C++ features. Our coding standard is often described as "C with classes."
 I have an interview coming up for a low latency position that also involves distributed systems. What would this kind of C++ development entail compared to what I'm currently doing?
 In other words:
  
What are some high level concepts I might want to familiarize myself with before the interview?
 
More broadly speaking -- if, against all odds, I manage to land the position, what new skills might I be learning? What might I need to study up on in my own time? What would my day to day development look like? How might this differ from the development of an embedded software engineer?
 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the code look at https://godbolt.org/z/rdPnfqnY3.
 When compiling with MSVC, I get the following error:
  
error C3528: 'Is': the number of elements in this pack expansion does not match the number of elements in 'Tuples'
  
In essence, I expand two packs in a single statement:
 else if constexpr ((std::is_void_v<invoke_at_result_t<Is, F, Tuples...>> || ...)) 
 I am not too well versed with the spec to know if it is problematic or not. To me it seems obvious what it should expand to, for example if Is = 0, 1 and Tuples = Tuple1, Tuple2, Tuple3, then it should expand to:
 std::is_void_v<invoke_at_result_t<0, F, Tuple1, Tuple2, Tuple3>> || std::is_void_v<invoke_at_result_t<1, F, Tuple1, Tuple2, Tuple3>> 
 It is stranger that the code compiles with Clang or GCC. What's even more stranger is when I refactor it
 template <class F, std::size_t... Is, class... Tuples> constexpr bool tuple_void_output = (std::is_void_v<invoke_at_result_t<Is, F, Tuples...>> || ...); 
 and then use it as
 else if constexpr (tuple_void_output<F, Is..., Tuples...>) 
 then it also works in MSVC (you can change the define from 0 to 1 to activate this refactoring in the godbolt link). My IDE (CLion) is giving red squiggles though with messages:
  
For the definition of tuple_void_output "Template parameter pack must be the last template parameter"
 When instantiating the template variable: "Template argument for non-type template parameter must be an expression"
  
So my questions:
  
Is there something wrong with my code?
 Which compiler is correct?

 Management has just told us that because we're hourly, we won't be getting paid during this outage. I'm still here at my desk waiting for the servers to come up. I still have to attend meetings on teams when they happen. This can't be legal can it? I'm in the US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, not really a giving up moment but a rather sobering one, I have been learning C# for about 2 years now on and off (whenever time permits) and recently transitioned to C++. I started working with unreal and started messing around and found it rather simple.
 I then asked a programmer friend of mine for some tasks I could do to improve my knowledge, and suggested I try create a single Linked List, after multiple days, nothing, I could not figure it out to save my life. What bothers me is after looking up solutions online it looked like something extremely simple, and i realized just how much unreal does in the backend, now I just feel disheartened with a simple Linked List brought me to my knees. Anyways, not thinking of giving up, just more for those struggling to keep pushing and maybe some words of encouragement if this is the right place to ask/turn to. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought it'd be nice to provide some type of modern wrapper around SDL, and I've been struggling to create a proper wrapper as you'd need to define a custom constructor for it. This is fraught with errors 
 auto make_unique_window(const std::string &title, int x, int y, int w, int h) { auto window = SDL_CreateWindow(title.c_str(), x, y, w, h, SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN); auto custom_deleter_for_sdl_window = [window]() { SDL_DestroyWindow(window); }; std::unique_ptr<SDL_Window, decltype(custom_deleter_for_sdl_window)> some_window; return some_window; } 
 I also thought it would make sense to inherit from SDL_Window to add a constructor.
  class window : public SDL_Window {}; 
 but SDL_Window's definition isn't exposed to the user, and thus, it is an incomplete type. Thoughts on what I could do?
 Maybe something like
 namespace sdl { class window { private: SDL_Window* m_window; public: window(const std::string &title, int x, int y, int w, int h) : m_ window { SDL_CreateWindow(title.c_str(), x, y, w, h, SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN) } {} ~window() { SDL_DestrowWindow(m_window); } }; } // namespace sdl 
 Usage would look like
 auto my_window = sdl::window { "Title", 480, 640, 256, 256 };

 For the past 3 years I’ve deployed complex workloads into AWS Fargate/lambda for a large IoT company. 
 I want to take a step back and grab a really great C++ book. What would you recommend?
 Any other great resources, in a similar vein as the Crust of Rust on YouTube by Jon Gjengset.

 My plan is to duplicate RMQ messages at the beginning of the pipeline, then run the legacy pipeline and the new pipeline in parallel. That way we can ensure data integrity and eventually backfill the old data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When speaking to folks who have deployed Istio in production, I'm always surprised that only a few utilize anything more than mTLS. Sometimes they're not even aware that if they don't change the namespace defaults, they end up with the default service account attached to every pod, which means a single certificate is used for workload authentication—kind of defeating the purpose!
 Anyway, this is my attempt at demystifying Authorization Policies, Request Authentication, and OIDC/JWT user authentication workflows. Additionally, what if you could automatically generate Authorization Policies by letting a Network Mapper analyze your actual application traffic and pull metrics from Envoy directly? This is a very cool open-source project. Check out the details in the guide:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently the CEO and CFO of our mid size startup (300+) company have been bugging the engineers (15 SWEs), with new changes they want to implement. It is a flat hierarchy for the engineers with one Engineering VP. Recently, they told one of my work friends that other departments have people be held accountable for mistakes and publicly talk about “lessons learned” and things to make us grow. They said they have no insight on what the tech team does (we are the only full remote team) and want us to be like the other depts and talk about our failures, what we did wrong, what bugs we caused, and how we fix them. This seems so strange. We will sometimes have these talks internally with our own teammates but to publicly put us on blast in front of the whole company, or at least the top dogs? They don’t even mention our successes, why they hell do they want our failures? But anyway, I have a meeting with these execs tomorrow to “pick my brain” and because I was made aware of this beforehand, I’d love some advice on a good rebuttal that won’t get me fired or have a target on my back.
 Edited to add: The CTO either resigned or was fired, we don’t actually know since it was very ominous and quick. I see now that our CTO did a great job shielding the team from the execs because they are now suddenly joining our meetings and getting more involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in contact with this publisher for several months, they really liked the game but never went on with an offer, saying they needed at least another build update to compare and make an evaluation.
 Months passed and we got back in contact as we had a build update, but once again they didn't go with an offer as they thought we weren't gathering enough wishlists for them to feel confident, they gave us some slides with their in-depth evaluation which we actually appreciated, then basically closed contact as it's clear they're not interested...
 ...Until a new game demo just came out on steam, with a strikingly similar concept, execution, and even short/long descriptions.
 This is supposed to be the debut project of a "three-person team" (just how we presented ourselves to the publisher), "coincidentially" Chinese, but it's impossible to track who's behind.
 What is even weirder is the marketing quality and precision of this game and its usage of Steam algorithm and events, which is too much of a coincidence to assume that they were just doing everything right on the first try as a studio.
 Cherry on the cake is that we received this publisher's report the same day they put their demo out and started engaging with their discord.
 I don't think the concept of "stealing ideas" even exist, my game itself is a re-elaboration of other devs ideas, but the fact that we directly came in contact with this publisher and everything is laid out to look like a coincidence, still makes me feel viciously stolen of something.
 Thanks for reading up to this point.
 Curious to hear any thoughts you have about this.
  
EDIT: I care to specify that I don't have 100% proof that this isn't just the biggest coincidence I've witnessed in my life, it's just an educated guess. The publisher I got in contact with itself said that they're under the "big hand of Chinese gaming", so they don't even need to publish it under their own name.

 So, I'm reaching out to all you fellow Rustaceans – what are some of the most mind-blowing, game-changing, or just plain cool Rust tips, tricks, or patterns that you've come across?
 Maybe it's a clever way to use generics, a surprising application of lifetimes, or a subtle optimization that made your code run like lightning. Whatever it is, I'm eager to learn from your experiences and expand my Rust knowledge.
 Let's share our collective wisdom and help each other become better Rust developers!

However, I noticed that the go-graphql library is not maintained. After some research, I tried using gqlgen, but I didn't like it—it felt cumbersome for creating an MVP. Are people still using GraphQL with Go? If so, how are you using it?

 Starting build...

So I get a build finished successfully, ok cool, it worked. Now let's run it and output hello world. I use '(gdb) Launch' and it tells me that I'm missing a launch task? This is extremely confusing as I've never had this issue even once on Windows.... 
 Here's my launch.json, have no idea what this is or why I need it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I did all the basics of math in school and I took an upgraded course before I could study comp. science at university.
 I was bad at it, and Math doesn't actually interest me. The sciences never did, so it's weird I've landed myself in Computer science, and truth be told, I'm not a particularly skilled programmer either. My field of interest lie in the aesthetics, the creative, and the collaboration of thinking of, and implementing games. I did just well enough in projects that I didn't feel discouraged from the entire field, and now I still want to be a contributor in game dev. That said, I feel like math or just my inattention to detail is a problem.
 During the higher education I encountered a few instances where I would tell someone "Err, so I don't actually know how to write this" and they'd say "It's just phytagoras. I can't tell you what to do." and I had to figure something out on my own to make a cube move on the screen or something, and I ended up kinda not figuring it out, and I think eventually whoever said something about pythagoras did something on his own.
 And it's not like I don't know the pythagoras sentence, it's just that in practice I suck at math and barely know how to apply it. I remember some shit we drew on a blackboard but it doesn't come naturally to me to think mathematically.
 But now I'm facing specific needs like, I wanna figure out how to make an eye shader, cuz I have a 3D model where I'm dissatisfied with how glassy the eyes look. But people give me math stuff to figure it out. I'll be running in circles with some design I'm trying to code until some smart guy shows me some x = y2 + i > 0 ???? math that apparently solves it in one sentence.
 So I'm a bit agitated by my lack of appliccable knowledge. Do you find that Math is important to your average game work? And if I were to learn about how to develop my own shaders, is there some kind of book that could help me?

I've been learning c for some time and I recently had a project idea that might make me slightly better at using C if I implemented some ml algos. So I was thinking of making a decision tree clustering algorithm, where I'll substitute the criterion for measuring the variance with the f score and then use that for clustering algorithm. Just some idea had when I was studying decison trees and I wanna see if it works. 
 Is it even feasible? What approaches would you try? How can I do matrix multiplications and additions? Will I have to use the c for loops for that sort of thing, or is there a library for optimising the additions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I always have a bit of writers block when it comes to this. I should probably just slap on a working title and go.
 I am reading advice that says "Keep the game name short and not to use words a 7th grader cannot spell", but the problem is essentially this:
 1) Every freaking combination of common words are taken and potentially trademarked items (much like you can't get the web domain name you want)
 2) Common words don't fare well as a search term.
 3) Lots of successful games historically have featured a non-word or made up name.
 The title really makes or breaks the game in terms of mood or seriousness. Naming it something ambiguous like Nox Arcanum or Ultima sorta has the benefit that they don't really "say" anything about the game, and do not constrain the developer in terms of story or design.
 And of course I don't want to get sued if something is "too close" to something else. I have this paranoia that corporate behemoths are always going to try to squash indies that aren't inside their financial tent. :D
 What do you guys do? Does anyone else find this decision absolutely paralyzing? I can think of a million parody names and say them in a Beavis & Butthead voice, but coming up with a single serious and marketable name is exhausting.
 Should I just put a number on the end like a username? 😆 Fantasy Adventure 3000?
 I almost think Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was borne of this same frustration. "Let's just string a bunch of crap together that probably hasn't ever occurred in sequence until now" 😆

 I wrote a blog post comparing Loki and Quickwit on a simple log management use case. I'm working on Quickwit engine so I'm obviously biased but:
  
I tried, as best as I can, to balance my view on focusing on the tradeoffs between the two engines: basically Loki is faster at ingestion and Quickwit is faster at query time.
 I met many DevOps who were not understanding the architecture/datastructures/tradeoffs of Loki and Quickwit, I think it's worth sharing the results at it will help users to make the right choice given their use case.
  
And I would love to get feedback on this, the benchmark code is available on github.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working in embedded C. The device receives ascii text one character at a time over a serial port and I would like to recognize when certain regex patterns appear in the stream. The character rate is highly variable and there are other tasks to perform, so I can't simply block on the serial port and collect data as a string.
 What I want is something like PEARL with various rules and actions, but with a one-char-at-a-time input. And it has to play nice with other round-robin tasks.
 The goal would be to do something like stringRecognizer() in the code below. The pattern rules would be regex that are pre-compiled by the lex-generator for (e.g.) recognizing the strings "CAT", "DOG" and "PIG" and returning an appropriate enum value that would trigger an action.
 The function is stateful, so it knows if it has seen (e.g.) C and then A, so a subsequent T would return ACTION_CAT but an R (or anything else) would return ACTION_NOT_DONE and move on. A D would also return ACTION_NOT_DONE but move the state into the DOG rule (so CADOG would eventually trigger the DOG rule). There might be a rule to reset the state machine when a new-line or carriage-return is seen.
 I've looked at lex, flex and re2c but none provides a stateful pattern recognizer. In all cases the state machine pulls data from either a string or an input stream, but is otherwise fully blocking. When the lex() function returns (to main()) all state is lost and restarts when a new string is supplied.
 while(1) { doTask1(); // blink led doTask2(); // read a sensor if (serialInputHasData()) { char c = getch(); action_t action = stringRecognizer(c); switch(action) { case ACTION_CAT: doCatFunction(); break; case ACTION_DOG: doDogFunction(); break; case ACTION_PIG: doPigFunction(); break; case ACTION_NOT_DONE: break; default: break; } } }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some might be aware of the old TomHarte/ProcessorTests repository, which was initially:
  
10,000 tests per opcode, for every 8-bit member of the 6502 family;
 each providing the before and after processor state for that opcode only, along with relevant memory values;
 with captured bus activity;
 expressed in JSON.
  
Over time that repository had become ungainly, covering additional processors and types of test gathered with varying degrees of rigour by a mix of authors.
 That resource has therefore given way to https://github.com/orgs/SingleStepTests/, an organisation rather than a single destination, allowing each repository to be:
  
much more focussed, on either a single processor or a small number of extremely-similar ones; and
 autonomously authored and maintained.
  
The old ProcessorTests repository also lingers there for now, but will be marked as archived in the near future.
 So: check it out if you're working on a new processor emulation. Compared to traditional test programs all collections should be both more comprehensive and more communicative in the case of a digression.
 Also please don't hesitate to contribute if you have the means to do so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have resources on how to go about learning asynchronous programming without multithreading? My previous experience with async programming has been with Go (which uses green threads managed by the runtime) and with Rust (which uses async-await and internally generates state machines that can cooperatively achieve asynchronous execution).
 Obviously, C is pretty bare bones, so I would be implementing the asynchronous mechanism from scratch. However, most resources online only show multithreading as a way to achieve async execution.
 EDIT: I understand that this might actually be impractical, which is why so much engineering effort is contributed to making languages such as Go. I'm mostly just interested in this for educational purposes.

 The arena which owns all the memory is getting initialized and freed automatically with no memory leaks (in fact it's completely hidden from the user). So how is that possible?
 You can do this for almost any type of program but I'll use my arena allocator as an example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think my org would benefit from a real-time linter, and I'm trying to figure out how to introduce it effectively and overcome cultural inertia. 
 The Java code base is 20+yrs old and has its scary places. There's one group of (sharp) senior devs that have been working with it a long time, and a second off-shore group that is significantly less experienced. Experienced group likes one IDE; new group has been told to use a different IDE (and a few rebels (me!) use a third).
 I have two main concerns that I'm hoping the tool can help with: code formatting consistency across multiple IDEs (PR noise), and coding apprenticeship factors ("Don't copy that, it's not a good example"). I am tired of PRs where I'm looking for NPEs, seeing 'if' statements that are 8 levels deep, and getting distracted by code moving from one line to the next because the line continuation moved. I'm hoping a lint-as-you-type tool would help with these types of issues, but I'm a bit overwhelmed on how to push it out. The new group is probably amenable, but the old group maybe not so much.
 Likely a phased approach is best, carrots over sticks, but what to prioritize in phase 1? Server side counts, or just let early adoption happen locally amongst the willing? Identifying & disabling the rules that generate too much noise? Editor freedom?
 Edit: I ran a full scan on the repo today. To give an idea of the scale of the problem: 46K files, 399 modules, 156748 issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is mainly for people working at a large company, as I imagine this would be less of an issue at a startup where everyone knows each other.
 My name is circulated semi-often as someone to contact when help is needed to fix issues in testing environments. From time to time, when someone reaches out to me for help, this is the entire message they send:
  
Hello u/idemockle
  
I have never talked to or heard of this person before, let alone know what they work on, so naturally I don't respond immediately. This greeting message is left to sit for hours before the person tries to reach out again, and most of the time, when they do reach out again, they still do not give any introduction or background into what they want.
 Any tips on how to deal with this behavior? I feel kind of bad just not responding, but I also find it incredibly rude to reach out to someone you don't know for help then make them have to pull teeth to get any information about it. Usually, I don't respond until they give more context (if they ever do).
 I'm curious if others on here have encountered the same thing, if you think not responding is justified, and if not, then what you do to get the information you need in order to help without wasting a bunch of time on a back and forth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have made a prime number calculator and I don't get the speed increase from rayon I'd expect. Here is the simple code behind it:
 let max = args() .nth(1) .ok_or(eyre!("No argument provided"))? .parse::<usize>()?; let mut primes: Vec<bool> = vec![true; max + 1]; primes[0] = false; primes[1] = false; let max_check = (max as f32).sqrt().ceil() as usize; eprintln!("Finding primes up to {}...", max); for i in 2..=max_check { if primes[i] { // Single-threaded let mut j = 2; while i * j <= max { primes[i * j] = false; j += 1; } // Multithreaded using rayon primes .par_iter_mut() .skip(i * 2) .step_by(i) .for_each(|is_prime| *is_prime = false) } } 
 It is a basic Sieve of Eratosthenes.
 In the multithreaded version the work of turning multiples of i into non-primes is spread across all 16 threads of my computer, however the execution time of both methods are essentially the same, even though every core is maxed out in the multithreaded version.
 Any idea why I don't get a 16x speed increase? Does it have to do with rayon or is my code just bad?
 I have about 1 billion booleans in my array, so rayon seems like a good idea

 I'm wondering whether there's JSON libraries can deserialize and point to input buffer(s) when deserializing? 
 Use case: I'm building a system where I get input data by communication channels, pass it to a deserializer function that writes data out to std::string_view. 
 When the callee function use JSON library which copies from the buffer, the std::string_view points to local memory that will be invalidated when it returns the parsed data. 
 I hope I made it clear enough, if not, please inquire.

 Hamza

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I say PM I need the one who is supposed to do requirement analysis and translation. Whatever the title is -- sometimes it's called Business Analyst too I think.
 Basically, I have never met even one good PM (or whatever you call it) in my 6+ years of experience. I think a good PM should worth the salary of one dev + one business side, and probably more if applicable.
 Sometimes I wonder why it is so difficult to grow one good PM. I suspect it has something to do with how corporations grow. In the beginning there is usually no middle man, and devs directly talk to the business. This is fine when it is still small -- but then business grows and experienced devs/business either leave or just care about their own stuffs. Then corp realizes that it needs some middle men -- but they rarely hire devs/businesses from the rank, instead hiring from externals -- those people might be good PM in their previous companies, but they are sort of useless in the new environment because each one has its own communication "flavors". Then it needs another 2-3 years to grow those PMs, but how can they learn effectively if they neither go through business nor dev? It's going to take much longer to learn the rope -- and that's why we see so many echo chambers instead -- it's not their fault, because they are not experienced in this specific environment, what else can they do?
 That leaves my conclusion that a company should always hire PM from experienced internal business or devs instead, and PM should be a senior position -- there should be no "junior" PM positions. What do you think?

 I'm talking about this if statement: if ((y == 2) && (z == 8) && (k == 1)) { //1
 I want to display a '1' on a 7 segment display when an elevator is on the bottom floor. 
 This code is placed in void loop(). 
 The variable y, z, and k all have the correct values when they should, which means that the program should enter the if statement. 
 I don't understand why the program doesn't execute the code inside the if statement. 
 I have tried to write the digitalRead() functions inside the if parentheses but that won't work.

 What is/was the worst company you’ve worked for?

A lot of it I know more or less. But should I have any specific paths completed in THM before I enroll in the PNPT cert? Or am I okay to jump right in? 
 I really just wanna make the step up to (what I consider) level 2 pentesting where it's active directory environments and domain controllers. I'm just not sure if I'm ready or if I should spend time in other areas first. How would you go about it?

We had a ton of fun working on it, got really good feedback on initial marketing and still would like to finish it one day. However the scope was too large, my friend and I both had day jobs at other studios and we were just too busy to finish at the time. "Solo" Failure 1.
 I took a break from development for a while and just did my job at the studio because the halt on that project broke my heart a bit. Then it was time for round two. I started working on an 2D ARPG b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[finally done with the implementation of a single thread TCP server in C, with a basic event loop using the poll system call. it can handle multiple clients simultaneously while staying single-threaded. send a message, get it echoed back.
 source code: https://github.com/biraj21/tcp-server/
 pls note that i'm new to socket programming so the code might be prefect. there's also a client to test the server. check README.
 i'm new to network programming. i've followed Beej's Guide to Network Programming to get started with sockets, and other resources are mentioned in the README.
 summary of what i've done:
  
getaddrinfo() function to fill address details
 socket() system call to get a socket fd
 bind() it to an address and listen()
 event loop: create pollfd structs, starting with socket fd followed by connection fds
 use poll() with 0ms timeout
 process (recv() and send()) ready connections by checking pollfd's revents field
 check socket's pollfd struct to accept() new connections
  
i would appreciate your critiques.
 it's amazing how so many complexities are taken care of by the abstractions in higher-level languages like php and node.js (ik it's a js runtime).
 C ftw 🏎️

A physicist does not need to know the meaning of life and why we exist to understand the laws of physics. They never will. They learn from others or see it with their own eyes. A software engineer does not need to know how electricity works to write software. My point is, every subject matter expert becomes a “tinkerer” when you follow the branches of “but why does it work this way”. There is no point to this post, I was pondering the meaning of life while at the gym. Have fun with these thoughts in your head. :)
 [Edit] The car mechanic part isn’t true, I apologize for not researching this first.
 [Edit] I didn’t mean that learning things that are the “why” does not matter. They definitely do, being a SysAdmin or SWE before devops/cloud definitely makes you valuable. I just wanted you guys to think more about the meaning of life and love that you exist. Most of us probably spend a good chunk of our week working and lose time with family and our ourselves.

 [Edit Last Time] If you’re reading this and are actually getting upset over a reddit post, go touch grass. This was a thought experiment, of course people should learn the fundamentals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Encountering this problem a lot lately:
 Say I have an entity and a kafka topic related to that entity.
 I need to publish an event related to that entity once, and prevent further attempts to publish.
 I can have a "published" column in my db that I check before publishing the event.
 If !published, proceed to publish the event, then update published = true for that row.
 The problem: if my publish succeeds, but my update fails, the column remains false for that row. If another publish attempt occurs, I will read !published again and try to publish when I shouldn't.
 I could update the published column before the publish has occurred, but 1) this is an anti pattern since the publish hasn't occurred yet and 2) if the db update succeeds but the publish fails, I'll again have a column that is inaccurate.
 I suppose in this particular circumstance I could just roll back the db update - but that could also fail.
 If this happens 25,000 times in one day, I need to know which ones are inaccurate etc.
 Are there more sophisticated/elegant ways for handling this sort of problem?
 Edit:
 Thanks everyone for all the feedback. I guess I should add: there is UI involvement here where we want to allow the user to take the action that causes the publish only once. We want to disallow taking that action on the UI more than once. We also want to enforce the constraint in the backend. IMO it is bad design to let the user believe they can take action when they can't. We could let them sit there and click buttons all day and just let the backend decide and return an error code when they shouldn't have initiated the action, or we could stop them from taking the action in the first place which is what we're doing.

 My question is this, when a more mainstream game needs to launch a multiplayer game mode, or expand its current number of servers, how do game studios tend to do that?
 Do they go out and purchase the hardware themselves and run the servers in their office?
 Is it cloud based these days? ie do they find a third party cloud server provider and just upload their game server code then point the clients at it - then presumably pay a fee for server rental?
 How does this differ for smaller scale games?
 Thanks.

 error: no matching constructor for initialization of 'std::lock_guard<std::mutex>' 
 Code in which error is occuring. Also lock_ is mutex type.
 size_t size() const { std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(lock_); return buffer_.size(); } 
 MacOS version: 14.4.1
 Clang version: 15.0.0
 I tried downloading llvm@13 via brew and compiling but it didn't work even though it used to compile with previous MacOS version so I want to know what might be the reason causing this I even tried changing -isysroot, setting LDFLAGS & CPPFLAGS (which brew suggested).
 PS: I know RocksDB-5.8 is deprecated but its just what we are using at work. I also know the code fix for this(removing const) but I want to know why this error is occuring with os upgrade even after I tried with older version of Clang.

Here are my questions : 1) in what sense is dangerous to use the gets( ) function? 2) are there some good options to actually get strings from user?, ive used scanf but it gets weird sometimes, so now tryng fgets but still sometimes act weird with stdin. Also is there a way to remove the '\n' i get when using fgets( )?. 3) why a professor is using a function that souldnt be used from probably more than 10 years? Hope those are not noob questions, any tips is welcome.

 I think Human Diaspora is pretty accomplished, but it's also a few years old now (May 2022). I am pretty sure that a number of other titles have come out since that raise the bar - especially considering how much more interest Godot has gotten in recent months after Unity started having problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I'll try to not make this another post about the job hunt, but was recently made redundant as a Cloud Engineer and was there for two years. I have been deskilled to some degree, but had experience with CI/CD and Azure DevOps for Terraform and Puppet.
 Since I started looking prior to this role, most 'Cloud engineer' titles just wanted some basic understanding of these skills, Now, they're mostly looking for people with fully developed skills and the title seems to have changed from Cloud Engineer to either Platform Engineer or DevOps. 
 I couldn't find a subreddit for cloud engineering or the likes, and mostly did similar things to DevOps (to some degree at least?)
 So I want to ask a few things, if you'd be kind enough to provide your opinion.
  
What exactly does DevOps do in Python/Go? 
 I've got more Azure experience than AWS experience, should I go for a cert in AWS to cover the lack of experience? (It seems AWS is the go to, and I always preferred it. But I can't afford to waste time in the wrong area.)
 If I can build new Docker Images, deploy and maintain, is there anything else that would be required to learn?
 If I have my GitHub linked in my CV, what would you expect to see? Is a tool with GUI for say, monitoring internet connections or retrieving data via an API okay? I suppose this linked to my first question. 
 Puppet or Ansible? Why? 
  
I'd appreciate any response, as I'm feeling pretty down about the situation.

I'm currently working for porting existing libraries like magic_enum, fastgltf and etc (which are used in my private module based projects). Changing dependencies with module is quite easy and giving me much benefits for compile time.
 During porting, I'm curious about which folder is the proper location for module port file (which ends with .cppm or .ixx extensions). At first I think src or module is the answer, because it is not header file and cannot be included. However, I realized that package managers like vcpkg does not install files in those folders, but compile the sources files to static/shared libraries (which ends with .a or .so extensions).
 Some module supporting libraries like Vulkan-Hpp and glm locates the module file in include directory. In this case, vcpkg install the header files to include directory and user can fetch them using ${glm_SOURCE_DIR}/include/glm/glm.cppm to declare module target.
 There are many package managing strategies that are preserving file structures, but I think CMake + vcpkg is the de facto system for C++ developers, so I'm confusing about the proper module exposing method. I want to get your opinions.

 Thing is none of these numbers take living cost into account. Most quant jobs are in London and New York where the living cost is really high.

 The standard was finalized in Feb 2023. GCC has managed to do this in little over a year after the standard came out. This is brilliant and rarely happens with modern compilers.
 Thank you a ton to all the people who contributed to GCC and made all this possible.

 I'm not sure if it is true or I'm just stupid or if it is true is it already known or I found first time? (Impossible)
 Sorry for bad hand writing. The idea is simple something like this:
 We give each other our public keys. You and me accomplish for two numbers (pre-partial-numbers that produce the pre-chain) and then we give each other their encrypted versions and then we have the final-chain (the protocol and client software can have common sorting and hashing as a reducer function... for example into a game card) After all each client software verifies the final chain with public keys of each peer and each peer will ensure that their pre-partial numbers are there inside and it is making the chaos for randomness because the common hasher/reducer function's hash is gonna be unpredictable.
 The fact that's providing this is that when peers encrypt their pre-partial-numbers with their private keys (RSA) there is no any pattern between them to predict and break the protocol safety. (Or there is? Idk.)
 If this whole thing is not bullshit, I will implement it in my game server.
 Thank you.

 Consider the following C++ union: ``` struct Mystruct { char *p; // sizeof(p) == 8, alignof(p) == 8 uint32_t sz; // sizeof(sz) == 4, alignof(sz) == 4 }; // sizeof(MyStruct) == 16 (with padding), // alignof(MyStruct) == 8
 union U { MyStruct s; char buf[16]; }; ```
 My question is can I safely read the last element only of buf[] even when buf[] is not the last written to (active) member of the union? I believe that based on the way unions must work in any compiler implementation this element (buf[15]) can never be overwritten by any write to the MyStruct s. Is that correct?
 The primary objective is to be as space-efficient as possible while also working reliably.
 What I'm doing: This union is the sole data member for a string class (we'll call it MyString). Within that string clas…]]></summary>

I have noticed that historically, if I involve my entire team (4-5 data engineers) early on in the design/prototyping, it turns into this "too many chefs in the kitchen" situation. The project would take forever to complete.
 This past weekend, I was recovering from a surgery, so I decided to "hack" this new project. I terraformed the infrastructure, and creating a workable prototype (limited functionality). I built this entire system in two days. It would have taken my team weeks/months, if they had started working on it from 0%.
 Now, I can delegate the 20% of the work (refactoring, optimzation, etc) to my team and just relax this upcoming quarter. Does anyone else do this type of "runway", getting ahead of the team sprints?

 I still think the main reason is section 174. If software salary and expenses of that are taxable as Research and Expenses, the more software worker and the higher salary of them will mean more tax to the company. That is why after the overhiring, the company needs to pay more taxes. Thus, overhiring is not even the main reason.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 I've written a tool at the company I work at that basically allow you to autogenerate any boiler plate code based off a yaml file and a Jinja template schema. At work, we use to tool to autogenerate C++ classes that have built in serialize/deserialize functionality for all kinds of different message classes that we work with. I've also written templates that can autogenerate Protobuf converters that convert a C++ message object to its protobuf equivalent. This has been super handy for us because we work with many different C++ message classes and hand typing all the converters would be tedious and error prone. 
 My question is: I am debating making this tool open source, but want to see if other people who write C++ encounter similar problems to this and if a tool like this would be valuable and helpful before I spent a bunch of time re-working it and making it available on GitHub. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,So I'm displaying some simple text information, and I was wondering if someone can tell me a better way to do this to be more accurate depending on the changing text. The Log function essentially does this:
 std::cout << std::format("{}\t\t{}\n", LogTypeToString(type), vformat(fmt, args));
 The displaying of the text:
 constexpr auto renderTextSize = sizeof(renderer); Log(LogType::Info, "{:*^{}} OpenGL Information {:*^{}}", "", 16 + renderTextSize, "", 16 + renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, "* Version : {} ({}.{}) {:{}} *", version, glVersion[0], glVersion[1], "", 26 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, "* Vendor : {:{}} *", vendor, 52 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, "* Renderer : {:{}} *", renderer, renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, "* GLSL Version : {:{}} *", glslVersion, 52 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, "{:*^{}}", "", 76 - renderTextSize); 
 As you may see, since the renderer text seems to be the longest by nature I'm trying to use that as the complete width so that this box shape using "*" is always just a space ahead and everything else meets it. I got it to look good with my settings, but I'm wondering how it would look if my information was different. Something tells me it wouldn't make a nice box.
  
[Info] ************************* OpenGL Information **************
 [Info] * Version : 4.6.0 NVIDIA 552.22 (4.6)
 [Info] * Vendor : NVIDIA Corporation
 [Info] * Renderer : NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Laptop GPU/PCIe/SSE2 * [Info] * GLSL Version : 4.60 NVIDIA [Info] **********************************************************
  
EDIT: It's hard to get it to display here, but basically the first line makes as many "*" to the length of the Renderer: text. So that it would complete the so-called "box."
 That's how it displays in the console. Currently, everything is designed with my own hardware information in mind, but I'd like to make it dynamic.Thanks, and have a great day.

It's like C with batteries, but easier. That being said I don't know it yet so I'm sure it will get very complex. I welcome that. I have been also using AI as a consultant or a tutor, (I enjoy programming , I'm not using AI to generate code. You can't learn it that way anyway, and learning it is my main objective) and let me say that is also an amazing tool. Anytime I am unsure about something I just ask the AI and it clears it up. What a great time to learn a new language. I've been having some trouble grasping interfaces, but it's not like I must understand them right now. I'm not a newbie. C was my first language, then Python, C#, a bit of Java, bash, batch, and I used Visual Basic a long time ago, but I usually don't mention that. I welcome any tips you guys may have that could help me understand it even better. I primarily intend to use it for CLI, and web applications. It really impressed me that I was able to take the basic "Go web examples" , and build a small CRUD app with password hasing, templates and database access, just by breaking down the examples. It just works, lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working with Godot for about 3 years now. Over that time I have often found myself on https://godotshaders.com/shader/ looking through their catalogue. I must say, it's sadly not very populated.
 I'm not sure why as the UI and site layout is perfect for it's role, I'd really love to see it used more.
 Are people aware of this site? If so are you willing to donate shader code to it?
 I've seen 20-30 posts sharing shader code over the past 2 days and I feel it rather sad that that code will practically vanish once the posts are thrown to the bottom of the reddit post stack. A lot of them just don't get enough attention to show up in search result so for all intents and purposes they're gone.
 I'd like to urge players to post their shaders on the site - it really is a great archive and I feel it would add a lot more permanency to your contribution. As it stands, posting it to reddit you're limiting yourself (and others) to around a 48 hour window before the post becomes practically invisible to the general public.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context: I am an electronics engineer by education and practice, but I switched to full time software development in 2016.
 By far, C and C++ has been most of my career. Dangerous languages perhaps, but languages that know they are dangerous, and document exactly where the sharp edges are located.
 However, for about a year and a half, I've been branching out and it appears to me that every single language and technology I look at has behaviors that are not defined. They just don't admit to it.
 I opened an issue in docker's documentation because they were missing an explanation for a behavior. Closed as resolved with, paraphrased, "read the repository if you want to know how docker works."
 By that standard, C++ doesn't have undefined behavior either! Just read your compiler's source code and you'll know what happens.
 Same problem with Microsoft's Azure cloud services. Many guides and tutorials but no authoritative source that explains how Azure works, what each option does, and how they interact - or if there is, it's sufficiently burrowed that I've been unable to find it after searching for a while, and their representatives cannot guide me to it either. Dotnet projects? Same issue again, there's any number of properties you can set for your project and you just have to guess from their name what they will do - and don't get me started on the difficulty of writing provably correct golang.
  
I can sign for the correctness of C/C++ software. I might be wrong because mistakes happen, but those are mistakes, not lies.
 I cannot sign off on most other software. If I claim that I know something is correct, I am lying. I don't know. I'm guessing. "It worked so far."
  
I can write software in all these languages, use all these other technologies. I cannot do engineering with them. I wish I could.

 The code is a relatively simple script that fits a quadratic to a few datapoints using gradient descent with an Adam optimizer. I am aware that there are easier ways of doing this, such as with least squares.
 The last few months, I've been working in embedded systems in C, but most of my programming experience is in data science with Rust and Python. This script was just something I wrote to have a bit of fun making C behave more like an OOP language with a task I'm more familiar with.
 I've since rewritten the script in Zig, but I also wanted to try rewriting it with C++. I'd also like to stick to exclusively using stuff from the standard library, if possible.
 Since I don't have much experience with C++, are there any specific features I should try to advantage of here?
 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated
 (for those curious, the data should reflect y = x^2 - 2*x + 1)
 Here is the C code:

 I'm a novice when it comes to C++ and CMake. I created a small project using the libigl library, and used their sample project as a starting point, replacing the main.cpp with my own .cpp file and uncommenting the libigl modules I used in the CMakeLists.txt.
 Now I also want to add fTetWild to my project and use it via function wrapper. That wiki doesn't explain how to do so, but I'm assuming it works just like outlined in the slightly older TetWild project.
 So, what I did is:
  
In my project folder, create an fTetWild folder and put the full fTetWild project in there
 
In fTetWild, create a build folder, go to the build folder and do cmake .. and make. This does a bunch of stuff, some of which is crea…]]></summary>

The ls in the ll integer suffix must have the same case, so u, ul, lu, ull, llu, U, Ul, lU, Ull, llU, uL, Lu, uLL, LLu, UL, LU, ULL and LLU are all valid but Ll, lL, and uLl are not.
 You use octal way more than you think: 0 is an octal constant.
 strtod need not exactly match the compilation-time float syntax conversion.
 The punctuators (sic) <:, <%, etc. work differently from trigraphs; they're handled in the lexer as alternative spellings for their normal equivalents. They're just as normal a part of the syntax as ++ or *.
 Ironically, the Standard uses K&R style functions everywhere in the examples. (Including the infamous int main()!)
 An undeclared identifier is a syntax error.
 The following is a comment:
  
 /\ / Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. 
  
You can't pass NULL to memset/memcpy/memmove, even with a zero length. (Really annoying, this one)
 float_t and double_t.
 The Standard, including the non-normative parts, bibliography, etc. is 540 pages (for reference a novel is typically 200+ pages, the RISC-V ISA manual is 111 pages).
 Standard C only defines three error macros for <errno.h>: EDOM (domain error, for math errors), EILSEQ ("illegal sequence"; encoding error for wchar stuff), and ERANGE (range error).
 You can use universal character names in identifiers. int \u20a3 = 0; is perfectly valid C.

 I’m pretty sure it’s 13.52 mhz mifare, but there appears to be 3 different models, 1k, 2k, and 4K - Im not sure which one. There is zero identifying details on my fob, no text or markings. Please see the attached pictures.
 After looking into a bit it, it appears the promark3 or a service such as “clone my key” / a key duplicating kiosk could work.
 What would be the simplest / not super expensive path forward?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm messing around with C++20 Coroutines and I wanted to get access to the member coroutines class reference in the returned promise_type wrapper.
 This works fine by providing a constructor in the promise_typelike below (Godbolt): 
 struct S; class Wrapper { public: class promise_type { S *_s; public: promise_type(S &s) { _s = &s; std::cout << "S Ref " << "\n"; } /* the rest of the promise type */ }; }; struct S { Wrapper base(){ std::cout << "Base" << std::endl; co_return; } }; int main() { S s; auto foo = s.base(); } 
 However, this fails when you pass in a derived type (Godbolt): 
 <source>: In member function 'Wrapper T::sub()': <source>:41:5: error: no matching function for call to 'Wrapper::promise_type::promise_type()' 41 | } | ^ <source>:14:9: note: candidate: 'Wrapper::promise_type::promise_type(S&)' 14 | promise_type(S &s) | ^~~~~~~~~~~~ <source>:14:9: note: candidate expects 1 argument, 0 provided <source>:11:11: note: candidate: 'constexpr Wrapper::promise_type::promise_type(const Wrapper::promise_type&)' 11 | class promise_type { | ^~~~~~~~~~~~ <source>:11:11: note: candidate expects 1 argument, 0 provided <source>:11:11: note: candidate: 'constexpr Wrapper::promise_type::promise_type(Wrapper::promise_type&&)' <source>:11:11: note: candidate expects 1 argument, 0 provided Compiler returned: 1 
 This can be fixed with concepts (Godbolt):
 template <typename Base, typename Derive> concept IsDerivedFromBaseRef = std::is_base_of_v<Base, std::remove_reference_t<Derive>>; ... template <typename Derive> promise_type(Derive& derived) requires IsDerivedFromBaseRef<S, Derive> { _s = &derived; std::cout << "Derived Ref " << "\n"; } 
 Does anyone know why this is? And is my fix using concepts robust? 
 Cheers
 Edit: 
 This seems to be a GCC bug. On Clang Trunk it works. On GCC Trunk, you get a internal compiler error that has already been reported

 For example, is it always guaranteed that the pointer types int (*)[], int (*)[][1], int (*)[][1][1] (and so on) will have the same representation as int *?
 Use case: Mostly an artificial scenario, but this legitimizes passing pointer-to-element (without conversion) to a function expecting pointer-to-array (or vice-versa).
 void foo(int *, ...); void bar(int (*)[], ...); void baz(int (*)[][1], ...); void test(void) { enum {nrows = 2, ncols = 3}; int arr[nrows][ncols] = {0}; void (*fn)(int *, ...); fn = foo; fn(*arr, nrows, ncols); fn = (typeof (fn))bar; fn(*arr, nrows, ncols); fn = (typeof (fn))baz; fn(*arr, nrows, ncols); }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently developing a prison-escape game, basically very similar to "The Escapists" but in a low-poly 3D setting. The steam shop page exists for a few months, not resulting in many wishlists, which I would expect for a hobby project without marketing (except for a few YouTube shorts (~100-400 views each)).
 So the daily wishlists were around 0-1, mostly 0. Then, a few days ago, I checked the tags again, and compared them to the tags to "The Escapists", since the gameplay is pretty similar.
 Here is my little/big fuck-up: The tag I initially set with the highest priority is (in german) "Ausbruchssimulation", which can also be understood as a game where you/the player has to break out of somewhere. I was kinda wondering why "The Escapists" is not tagged with the same tag, as I would imagine it is the most fitting for this kind of game.
 I looked at the games that were tagged with "Ausbruchssimulation", saw stuff like Pague Inc. etc., and had an epiphany: changed the language to english, "Ausbruchssimulation" is the translation for "Outbreak Sim".
 Yeah, so i removed the tag and (at least for the four days since) this also had an impact on daily wishlists: https://ibb.co/GHgBXxh

I am stuck in my current job because there is nothing more to do. I have revamped the entire infrastructure of my (medium sized - multi million) company, terraforming the infrastructure, managing and improving deployments, improved kubernetes, docker images, pipelines, etc…
 Now my company hired 3 new devops engineers for a different company because they are cheaper but s the tasks go to them. Because of that I had a lot of free time, but I’m actually losing motivation for devops. Automating used to be my passion but now I’m in a bit of a rut
 Due to certain personal circumstances I can’t leave the job at current moment; although I thought about it because I’m kinda reaching the ceiling of this company.
 If anyone has any advice, I would appreciate it

 I am building a Satellite (ST) to Ground Stations (GS) distributed communication system, and I am at the point where I am implementing leader election among satellites and async undirected graph based leader election for the ground stations. The election processes do indeed finish, upon which point the coordinator process (rank n-1) sends out the ST leader to all GS processes and the GS leader to all ST processes respectively.
 Everything works fine for the ST election and message passing, but for some reason, when the coordinator sends out the GS_ELECT event to all ST processes after the GS leader election, the ST processes do not receive the event. I tried logging the probe's tag, and it is just always START_LELECT_ST and no matter what event is sent afterward, it just never changes the status of the probe, neither with GS_LEADER nor with TERMINATE.
 The relevant ST receiving part is on line 200 of the pastebin source code. I am busting my head trying to figure out why this is happening since if I am not mistaken, MPI_Probe and MPI_Iprobe should be seeing the pending new events and grabbing their tags.
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

 Art…
 I chose pixel art because I thought it would be easier than the other art styles. I no longer think this. The idea that “there are only so many ways you can arrange 32x32 pixels” was very naïve. I did however find that this limitation forced me to be creative in a way that didn’t sacrifice consistency, and consistency seemed to be worth a lot more than assets that were individually ‘good’.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to Golang, and trying to build an app that uses 3rd party APIs on behalf of the user. I've seen in the documentation that you should always reuse the clients in order to take advantage of existing HTTP connections. At first, that looks pretty straight forward: initiate a new client at start time, attach it to the server struct and access the client from anywhere, like a singleton.
 Now, say I have a Gitlab client that sends requests on behalf of an user which has provided an access token. I cannot initiate the client at start time and reuse it (setting the token before calling the api) because I could have race conditions where an user ends up with the token from someone else, so sharing an authenticated client seems like a no go. 
 I think I could create a client per http request, making it unique per client, but then if I only make one call to gitlab per request it's the same thing as never reusing the client.
 Do I make sense? How should I go for such use cases?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/godot,
 I've been working on a project called GodotInGameBuildingSystem, aimed at helping developers easily integrate building mechanics into their Godot games. It’s straightforward, open-source, and I hope it can be useful to some of you!
 Features:
  
Dynamic Building: Add robust building functions that allow players to construct and customize their environments.
 Customizable: Adjust it to suit your game’s unique style and needs.
 Written in C#: Currently available in C#, ensuring robust performance and integration.
 Open Source: Free to use and modify under the MIT License—contributions are welcome!
  
Why consider it?
 It’s built specifically for Godot, making integration smooth, and it’s a great way to add interactive elements to your game. I’d love for you to try it out and share any feedback or suggestions!
 Future Plans:
 I am planning to develop a version in GDScript based on community interest. The sooner I see significant interest, the faster I'll work on releasing the GDScript version!
 👉 See it on Asset Store
 Thanks for checking it out, and happy developing!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With recent breakthroughs being made on the N64 scene such as Ship of Harkinian for Ocarina of Time and the now released Zelda64Recomp project for Majora's Mask, discussion has opened up regarding the difficulties of emulating N64 throughout the years and alternative solutions moving forward. While previous projects have brought many games to a playable state over the years, many audio and visual effects end up getting lost lost in translation. With these recops projects, were now able to get fully intact ports of these games in all their glory with plenty of enhancements as well.
  
Zelda64 Recomp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywWwUuWRgsM
  
With there now being a healthy interest for N64 from both fans and developers regarding these recent projects, it got me thinking about other consoles such as the OG Xbox and Sega Saturn that also have a troubled history with emulation progress over the years. How cool would it be to have decomp/recomp projects for games like Jet Set Radio Future and Panzer Dragoon Orta?
 For those of you with experience working on such consoles, how feasible do you see this? Is this something that has piqued the interest of anyone in these communities?
 Looking forward to hear what you guys have to say. Recompilation looks to be a much more accessible alternative to the undertaking that a full decomp entails.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Work for an agency so I generally do client work. I've been with my current client for an unusually long time (years) which is my longest term engagement and they're very happy with me. It's a non-tech company in a lucrative industry.
 The work is generally easy but I am the only developer in the organization. As such, the work I do is often glueing their SaaS products together in some way or building small internal tools for my stakeholders. Don't really exercise my dev muscles often and the easiest (least complicated) solution is often the best one for their needs.
 The pay is great and generally the WLB is comfortable, but I don't work with any other devs and really feel my skills deprecating over time. The pay is at the top-end of what my expected range would be like so it's difficult to make a change without taking a pay cut. I worry that whenever this engagement ends (they always do), I will be a much worse dev than I was prior to working here. However, it's hard to not make hay while the sun is shining, so to speak, and just collect the easy money while it's here.
 What would you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For example, like the title says, if I'm given a bunch of employee unique ID and a number (hours of work) associated which each one of them. How would you solve this?
 I know that std::vector or std::array is pretty standard (storing a string and an integer) and putting them inside a Class. But I'm getting to know std::unordered_map and std::map and they seem be extremely useful in this cases since they store elements as key-value pairs. So it becomes very easy to add, retrieve and manipulate.
 So getting back to the original question, in your expert experience what would be the best way to solve these type of problem? Going for std::unordered_list, using a std::vectors, or anything else? 
 Thanks!
 EDIT: Providing more information: I'll need to add daily new members, and get information from them, so storing large amounts of data. The speed in which it's done it's not really that important.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi DevOps Engineers! 
 I've been playing around with RAG (retrieval augmented generation) with terraform projects to build something useful in the world of DevOps. I've been asking my software friends what pain points they experience in the cloud deployment aspect of DevOps, especially when it comes to creating and managing cloud infrastructure. 
 I wanted to utilize my knowledge in ML and AI to perhaps enhance or improve DevOps workflows but I need to learn and listen to what the actual difficulties DevOps Engineers face in companies that I could perhaps explore as a hobby. 
 It would be amazing if people share problems that DevOps Engineers see could be solved by implementing some codebase integration with RAG and then perhaps using retrieved info with LLMs to make informed decisions? 
 I recently created a short demo which converts natural language queries to a runnable terraform deployment (The agent I coded for this hobby project also fetches relevant config parameters that might be needed for the Terraform Code). I wish I could embed it here but I don't want to link my YouTube for the sake of anonymity. 
 Also, I'm just throwing ideas out here that aren't fully fleshed out and looking for inspiration!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the newest set of bugfixes, the experimental Rust to .NET compiler backend is coming closer and closer to being usable!
 The std built by the project is now functional enough to handle things like creating/writing to files, and writing to stdout / stderr.
 This small snippet of Rust code:
 use std::io::Write; fn main(){ println!("Hello from Rust to .NET!"); std::fs::File::create("/tmp/rust_on_dotnet.txt").unwrap().write_all(b"Hi from Rust, .NET").unwrap(); eprintln!("We are writing to stderr!"); } 
 Can now run without issues within the .NET runtime!
 While this week has been a bit busy for me (first 3 final exams), I still made some progress in other areas too.
 Besides this, I have also eliminated 2 memory corruption errors (one related to closures, one related to small constant values). Those issues were found using valgrind - a memory debuting tool, which I now use to verify the Rust code compiled for .NET behaves correctly (the runtime can run under valgrind, if the right flags are set).
 I have also finished a round of extensive fuzzing (46 434 773 LOC of MIR test programs), which allowed me to find and patch many other issues (mostly related to floating-point numbers).
 Some issues still remain (13 out of 10 000 generated tests still fail, and the fuzzing tool I use does not check for every kind of bug), but a lot more Rust code should now compile properly.
 There is still a lot of work to do, but I wanted to share some of the progress.
 Also, the project has reached 1024(2^10) stars on GitHub! So, I would like to thank people for the amazing reception my project has had!
 If you have any questions/suggestions/whatever, feel free to ask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm new to Go, and was surprised how much boiler plate code was required to use (I guess technically implement) a heap in Go when compared to say Java or C++. I'm trying to understand why this is the case.
 I understand that the sort interface needs to be implemented along with Push and Pop. From my newbie POV it seems that the reason why other languages only require a comparator is because priority queue's in Java and C++ are able to provide a concrete heap implementation through generics? So is this a vestige of pre-generics Go?
 I'd appreciate any discussion as to why this was the choice taken, as I'm hoping to get a better understanding of Go and become more gopher :).

 I had fun making my entry! Photons with 1000x the power. Somehow, my photon-mapper still managed to produce recognizable results.
 I guess most x1000 constants would totally break a game, but I was rather pleased with my experiment. The game felt like wandering the wastelands during a hydrogen bomb detonation. Interesting visuals! 
 Did you participate in the challenge? If so, let's share on this subreddit too!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to use ranger (https://github.com/ranger/ranger) as my terminal file manager for a long time. But the app is really slow. I always thought this is just how terminal apps are like, and not much can be done about that. Ranger is written in Python.
 Then I discovered yazi (https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) which is similar to ranger but it's blazing fast and snappy. It's written in Rust.
 The functionality of these apps is pretty similar, but the snappyness of yazi yet again reminds me how fast and rock solid Rust programs could be. I just don't understand why that's the case though—it's not like these apps do heavy number crunching or systems programming; they essentially provide a skin around terminal utilities such as ls and cd. Why is yazi so so faster then?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have a fairly new CTO thats pushing for various different process changes in dev teams. 
 Two of these is trunk based development and full time pair programming to enable CI/CD. 
 For context my team looks after a critical area of our platforms (the type where if we screw up serious money can be lost and we'll have regulators to answer to). We commit to repos that are contributed to by multiple teams and basically use a simplified version of Gitflow with feature branches merging into master only when fully reviewed & tested and considered prod ready. Once merged to master the change is released to prod. 
 From time to time we do pair programming but tend to only do it when it's crunch time where necessary. The new process basically wants this full time. Devs have trialed this and feel burned out doing the pair programming all day everyday. 
 Basically I ran my team on the idea of trunk based development and they're heavily against it including the senior devs (one of whom called it 'madness'). 
 The main issue from their perspective is they consider it risky and few others don't think it will actually improve anything. I'm not entirely clued up on where manual QA testing fits into the process either but what I've read suggests this takes place after merge to master & even release which is a big concern for the team. Devs know that manual QA's capture important bugs via non-happy paths despite having a lot of automated tests and 100% code coverage. We already use feature flags for our projects so that we only expose this to clients when ready but devs know this isn't full proof.
 We've spoken about perhaps trialing this with older non-critical apps (which didn't get much buy in) and changes are rarely needed on these apps so I don't see us actually being able to do this any time soon whereas the CTO (and leadership below) is very keen for all teams to take this all on by this summer.

 We have just crossed 2k sales 1yr after launch. Most of the recent ones on huge discounts, so we decided today to drop the regular price from 15$ to 5$.
 Background:
 We developed a game with three people for about three years next to our day-time jobs. We thought the idea of combining RPG and a guild collection topic with auto chess combat mechanics would be a fun one. And for a niche audience it actually is! Each positive review on steam makes me happy, and also the negative ones are mostly constructive, or it is just not someone's cup of tea. We don't take it personal. :-)
 Still, we hoped for a bit of a better outcome.
 A lesson learned is that marketability (appeal and readability) of the game is super important, and …]]></summary>

 The YoY number of average daily tech layoffs has declined by roughly 20%
  
Notes on the stats below: the difference in total numbers is due to TrueUp's much larger dataset (it tracks more startups & non-US markets).

 TrueUp.io
  
There are 211K open tech jobs today; there were 163K at the March 3, 2023 low. That said, the peak was 478K in April '22
 In 2023, there were 429K people laid off by 2,001 tech companies (an average of 1,175 people/day)
 So far in 2014, there have been 118K people laid off by 540 tech companies (an average of 891 people/day)
  
Layoffs.fyi
  
In 2023, there were 263K people laid off by 1,191 tech companies (an average of 721 people/day)
 So far in 2014, there have been 81K people laid off by 287 tech companies (an average of 619 people/day)
  
If it doesn't feel like it's improving, hang in there. No market moves in a straight line...but at least the bumpy ride appears to be on the right track!

 Why wouldn't C be more... obvious? Why the assumptions that a C++ environment is suitable for someone wanting to program in C?

Converting a function pointer to an object pointer type or vice versa is conditionally-supported.
  
Are there compilers where it is not supported?
 I have seen only compilers which support it. However, I haven't seen all compilers. My guess, is that the answer comes from an area like the following ones:
  
Maybe a category of compilers does not support it, like e.g. "it is typically not supported when you compile for processor/architecture X".
 It may be supported in all compilers nowadays, but it was not commonly supported say in the 1980s.

 But I'm not very strong in DSA. I got 2 month vacation from my college. I want to advance my DSA skills. From beginning I did DSA in C++.
 Last week I tried doing it in Golang. But I don't like doing it in golang.
 Should I try it in Rust? Or should I continue in C++?

 The checksum sumatory is the two last byte.
 I saw in the manual that the kind of checksum is 4096.
 I try to calculate the checksum 256 with this web but only coincide the first byte and not always.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can join the strings (or anything string-like, string_view or const char*) with a constant delimiter like:
 ``` template <std::ranges::range R> struct SlashJoiner { std::ranges::ref_view<R> view; };
 template <std::ranges::range R> SlashJoiner(R) -> SlashJoiner<R>;
 template <std::ranges::range R, typename CharT> struct std::formatter<SlashJoiner<R>, CharT> : range_formatter<std::ranges::range_value_t<R>, CharT> { constexpr formatter() { range_formatter<std::ranges::range_value_t<R>, CharT>::set_brackets("", ""); range_formatter<std::ranges::range_value_t<R>, CharT>::set_separator(" / "); }
 auto format(const SlashJoiner<R>& joiner, auto& ctx) const { return range_formatter<std::ranges::range_value_t<R>, CharT>::format(joiner.view, ctx); } 
 }; ```
 And its usage would be:
  std::vector words { "abc", "def", "ghi" }; std::format("{::s}", SlashJoiner { words }); // "abc / def / ghi" 
 Now I want to specify the delimiter in Joiner struct, like:
  template <std::ranges::range R> struct Joiner { std::ranges::ref_view<R> view; std::string_view delimiter; }; 
 However, format function must be const, therefore it doesn't let me call set_separator inside of it. What would be simple way for handle this problem?
  
Of course I know fmt::join and its implementation, but I'm curious that is there any fancy solution that using range_formatter's ability by any chance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 I'm looking at the following scenario: A (enterprise) team went the microservices route. Unfortunately there is zero data locality, everything is layered horizontally (persistence service, entity A logic service, entity B logic service, etc) and everything depends on everything else. Services keep each in other sync via synchronous RPC over network. In short, it's a distributed monolith.
 The project has progressed too far to make major architecture changes, and we need to move fast.
 We will soon have the foreseeable issue that keeping state synchronized across multiple distributed services and databases is hard. I shudder to think how the current system would behave during outages, and the many inconsistent states it will get in. I fear that if we don't intervene now, it will turn into a maintenance nightmare on release.
 If you've been in a similar situation, which eventual consistency pattern did you go with, and what was your experience? My main concern is keeping implementation overhead as low as possible. I've thought about the usual at-least-once event-driven + idempotency route, but I'm worried about the overhead during day-to-day development, and amount of changes required to even get started with that. Maybe try 2 phase commits instead?
 If you've been in a similar situation of trying to work with a distributed monolith, I'd be curious to hear what you went with, and what your experience was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have several projects I need to support. Currently the infra provisioning (gcp, kubernetes etc) is in terraform. I’m trying to figure out what practices people use to let developers self manage what the requirements are for each individual project without seeing/interfering with each other.
 I’m imagining perhaps just argocd to monitor some kubectl files stored in each project repo, plus maybe some kind of yaml file to tell me what databases, redis, etc they need provisioned, then based on ci/cd pipeline i just have a job that parses the yaml and generates terraform config in the background? I don’t really want to have all teams messing about in the master terraform repo

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I'm a beginner and currently trying to do an assignment which needs you to read from a text file. I am given a bunch of names and a set of numbers (don't ask what those numbers mean). So the text file looks something like this:
 Michael 0 5 12 6 15 
 Jessica 1 3 4 8 20 
 George Martin 1 3 4 8 20 
 Olivia 2 8 10 12 17
 I have to store a name and the numbers for each participant. I know how to read from a text file, but I have problems with the third name. As you can see the third name has a space in between, but I still have to store it into one variable. This is the part which I am stuck at, since I know that if I write:
 fileIn >> name; 
 fileIn >> number[0] 
 it will store George as a name and then it will try to store "Martin" into the numbers array. What would be your approach in solving this problem? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 Just a basic question I want to ask. Recently, I've been doing some code reviews and playing CTFs, all of which I'm doing on the provided machine over an SSH connection. However, whatever I do on the provided SSH server is getting logged in a file and somewhere else as well, but I don't have access to read or write these logs. Now, every single command that I run on their machine gets logged, and there's a challenge where I have to initiate an SSH connection or run any UNIX commands without them being logged into that file.
 Is there any way to do this? Also, I was thinking if I write a Python or Bash script and then perform tasks on the provided machine, maybe only the execution of the script with its name will get logged.
 Does anyone have an idea or suggestions on HOWTO do this?

At first everything is great. Honeymoon period.
 Then several hardships happened. But since I am still following the team's mission, no problemo.
 Then random reorgs happened. I wasn't impacted so no big deal.
 Then random projects unrelated to the (what I thought to be the main) mission appeared. I start getting confused.
 Then productivity dipped.
 Burnt out.
  
Of course the answer is always to look for a new job. But how can I get better at the timing? Preferably, how can I move on before reaching burnt out? How can I ride the waves better when various random unrelated projects appeared (after all, we are all just a pawn in the cog regardless how many ownerships I shown)?
 Edit: 25 YoE functioning as architect at various large companies. Spearheaded many successful large projects as well as failed projects.

        <updated>2024-05-11T05:11:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The dbg! macro is awesome, but I almost always use println! instead. I lose inline convenience and the automatic label, but I just can't stand pretty printing.
 When I'm trying to print the context of some execution, I'm usually expecting a ton of repetitive text. I find this way easier to read when parallelized; just painless to pattern match, scan over, and read across dimensions. The patterns are automatically provided to you, they're just there.
 What I want is this:
 [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 10] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 1] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 2] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 3] [src\comb.rs:1260:3] count = [7, 0] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 4] // .. 
 versus
 [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 10, ] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 1, ] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 2, ] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 3, ] [src\comb.rs:1260:3] count = [ 7, 0, ] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 4, ] // .. 
 This is actual dbg! output from my program, which also demonstrates how pretty printing can even be unnecessarily confusing. The lines [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count and [src\comb.rs:1260:3] count are very similar, but in the single-line example it's much easier to spot the odd one out.
 I can copy-paste the source code into my own macro, but for a debug tool that I'd wanna use everywhere and anywhere it's just not the same. Is there an environment variable or some way to disable pretty printing everywhere? I've searched, but found none.
 Either way, curious to hear your thoughts on pretty printing for debug output.
 Your dearest friend,
 Yokin

 We build an error handling solution with stack trace for large Rust projects like GreptimeDB. In practices, it display errors like:
 Failed to handle protocol 0: Failed to handle incoming content, query: blabla, at src/protocol/handler.rs:89:22 1: Failed to reading next message at queue 5 of 10, at src/protocol/loop.rs:254:14 2: Failed to decode `01010001001010001` to ProtocolHeader, at src/protocol/codec.rs:90:14 3: serde_json(invalid character at position 1) 
 Previously, errors in Rust mainly report the root cause, but it lacks a lot of context with which developers can debug the error. Moreover, std Backtrace brings a lot of unrelated intermediate stacks and increases a significant runtime overhead.
 Our solution is built upon snafu, which is like a combination of thiserror and anyhow, with less than 1% runtime overhead and binary size.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. So, as a challenge to myself to actually start doing projects in C, I decided to make a ncurses-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Part of the logic involves storing the current state in one matrix, and using that to build a second matrix for the next generation's state. Each cycle, the 'next state' (we'll call it m2) becomes the 'previous state' (m1), and my first implementation simply involved looping through the matrices and overwriting each cell of m1 with the corresponding cell of m2. While this works fine, I wanted to do it more "optimally" by simply swapping two pointer addresses. This is the function that I came up with:
 void swap_ptr(int (**p1)[ROWS][COLS], int (**p2)[ROWS][COLS]) { int (*tmp)[ROWS][COLS] = *p1; *p1 = *p2; *p2 = tmp; return; } 
 The implementation looks like this:
 int matrix1[ROWS][COLS]; int matrix2[ROWS][COLS]; int (*m1)[ROWS][COLS] = &matrix1; int (*m2)[ROWS][COLS] = &matrix2; /* main loop starts, insert Life logic here to populate m2 based on the contents of m1*/ display(*m2); swap_ptr(&m1, &m2); 
 This appears to be working fine, but it's not at all like the methods I found online for the same thing, which instead called for something more like:
 void swap_ptr(int ***p1, int ***p2); 
 Is there something wrong with the way I'm doing it, or is this just one of those funny C things where there's multiple "correct" ways to do something? Thanks in advance!
 EDIT: fixed typos in my code examples.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I am the author of the expriemental programming language specification 3Rus. I have released 0.1 of the specification. This is 10x simpler than C++ as this removes 7 keywords consteval, constinit, constexpr, concept, requires, template and typename. This introduces one new keyword _. Besides few others are introduced but those could be considered as same as older ones e.g. if1 and for1 have similar semantics to if and for. Besides, this removes macros and has reflection. Libraries like CTRE and serialization of any kind would become tremendously easy to achieve in this.
 But I have a feeling that semantics are incorrect and it is not what it appears to be. Please help me find out my mistake.
 This is an incomplete specification and only discusses language semantics from generics and reflection perspective and does not consider other aspects of the programming language.
 Please share your thoughts. https://github.com/HassanSajjad-302/3Rus/tree/0.1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently had a very disappointing and disrespectful experience during the recruitment process with Current (FinTech company). 
 I was assigned a medium level take-home assessment. The recruiter had mentioned that I had a week to work on it, and to email him if I had any questions or concerns on it.
 The take home assessment required a lot of time and effort, but I was able to complete it. It took me about a week to complete. 
 HOWEVER,
 I found myself reaching out to the recruiter to only get completely ghosted from the recruiter.
 The only acknowledgment I received was an impersonal, automated rejection email that offered no personal communication or constructive feedback.
 The best part: I also found out through the submission platform that my work had not even been reviewed! 
 What's the point of asking candidates to dedicate effort to a take-home task if it's going to be IGNORED??? Super disrespectful and unprofessional to request detailed work from candidates and then disregard it entirely.
 I urge potential candidates to be very cautious. Current's hiring approach demonstrates not only a lack of professionalism but also a disregard for basic respect and decency. 
 This experience highlighted a profound disrespect and unprofessionalism that prospective applicants should seriously consider before applying!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm thinking of learning a C++ GUI framework now and I wanted to hear people's opinions on which is best. People say QT is great because it's very fast and has lots of features, but the licensing model makes me a bit uneasy. If I had to some day, how much would I be able to do with just LGPL components?
 GTK is cross platform, but it seems native look is not a priority for them. This leads to strange inconsistencies in different UIs which might confuse users. Is GTK still the best option for performance reasons? Or does QT have better performance too?
 Finally there's wxWidgets. They compile to native toolkits on every platform, so it's probably the best for native look and feel. But is there a performance overhead because of the bindings and platform specific stuff?
 What does everyone think?
 Edit: I thought of another potential advantage of GTK: It has Rust bindings. I don't think any of the others do.

 prototype: char *join_strings(char const *string1, char const *string2) return NULL if allocation fails 
 It doesn't say anything about handling a NULL pointer, It's up to me to decide and justify my choice. So I could either return NULL if any of the parameters is NULL, or I could return a pointer to a copy of the non-null parameter.
 What would an experienced C programmer do instinctively by default?

 I've heard of people doing things like "snapshotting prod database to replicate it in dev/staging" to get the database similar. I've also seen things like "duplicate a function inside of an API call in code, and log the results so you can check the logs to see how things work"...which I guess is kind of a way to "dev with production traffic" but you have to do some sloppy work using production logging to see what happens.
 In the classic dev env -> test env -> staging env -> prod env set up, I'm curious how people here make sure the pre-production environments are similar to prod? How close are you able to get?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work on a shared library. I implemented class and struct like this: 
 namespace cpp_practicing { struct ImageSample { cv::Mat descriptors; }; class PoseEstimator { // some methods ... private: cv::Mat query_image; }; } 
 I import OpenCV headers in my header file:
 #include <vector> #include <filesystem> #include <opencv2/core.hpp> 
 My CMakeLists.txt is following:
 project(camera_pose_estimation_lib) set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -Werror -Wextra -O2 -lopencv_imgproc") # OpenCV find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED) set(OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE "Enable non-free algorithms" ON) INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS}) # Link Conan ... include_directories(${CONAN_INCLUDE_DIRS} "include") # add source files file(GLOB_RECURSE SOURCES "src/*.cpp") add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} SHARED ${SOURCES}) target_link_libraries( ${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${OpenCV_LIBS} ${Boost_LIBRARIES}) ... # add tests add_subdirectory(test) 
 Structure of project:
 ├── CMakeLists.txt ├── conanfile.py ├── include │ └── PoseEstimator.h ├── src │ └── PoseEstimator.cpp └── test ├── CMakeLists.txt └── LibraryTest.cpp 
 When I compile I get following error
 /usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/library_test.dir/LibraryTest.cpp.o: undefined reference to symbol '_ZN2cv3MatD1Ev' /usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libopencv_core.so.409: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status 
 If I comment out line with field query_image in class PoseEstimator everything compiles without errors.
 What can be the problem here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Will try to keep this as short as possible.
 8YoE here, got a new manager. A couple of weeks ago a bug comes up, i fix it, he gives me shit for it, doesn't allow the fix to go ahead, and says i got it wrong.
 He then proceeds to make a deal out of it, intentionally says in the standup, in front of his own boss too how "he was let down, and that feature is broken still".
 Literally less than 2 weeks later, he comes back and asks me to apply the same fix i did initially, because "he evaluated the situation, and found it best".
 He made me look like i have no idea what I'm doing in front of the team and management.
 Dude also micromanages, with things like "i sometimes look at branches, so don't push any code you haven't personally tested, even if it's to a branch you're not intending on opening a PR for" lol.
 A few days ago we had a 1:1, and unprovoked he tells me "you need to know something, I'm the boss! I make decisions, it's my team" this wasn't in response to something i said. No, he literally just stated it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although I don't like to do it, sometimes I need to use friend declarations to give private access to external classes/functions. Whenever I do, those external entities only need access to 1 or 2 members of the private class. But, giving friendship opens up the entire insides to the friends. So, it can become difficult to understand which privates get used externally, without inspecting the friends. To try to keep things sane, I segregate those members to their own private section. Best I can do is put comments to say they are used externally.
 private: // These are used by friends Foo mBar; Some Function(); private: //... Other private sections are not used by friends. 
 I wish C++ supported a 'friend:' access specifier in classes, similar to public/protected/private.
 friend: Foo mBar; Some Function(); private: // ... 
 If a class has a 'friend:' section, then those members are consider private, and they can be accessed by friend classes/functions. If such a section is present, the friend classes/functions are not allowed to access other private sections.
 It would be nice to have limited friendship.

 Code smells are driving me up a wall in our CI pipeline. Can anyone explain to me why the following is good practice? I got this smell from sonarqube.
 "Avoid explicitly specifying the template arguments by relying on the class template argument deduction."
 While I understand you don't have to specify the template in c++17, in what world is this bad practice? This seems insanely pedantic to me for no good reason, but maybe I am missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been programming for a while, but I’m new to devops and deploying a full stack app. Before, I would just spin up a DigitalOcean server, manually pull my code, and just run it using something like PM2. I’m looking for something a little cleaner this time around with CI/CD practices. But, I’m lost on what service to use. There’s so many between Vercel, Render, AWS, Firebase, and more. I have a few services to run, so I’m looking for advice.
 There’s the app built in Expo, which interacts with an API. The API schedules jobs using BullMQ (Which uses Redis), and there’s a lightweight worker that fulfills those jobs (The worker just sends some HTTP requests and interacts with a Postgres database).
 So I have to host - Redis - Postgres (Hosted by Supabase at the moment) - An API (Node) - Worker (Node)
 I was thinking the worker would be a good fit for a serverless function, though I’ve never worked with them. If I go with AWS, Redis and BullMQ can be replaced with SQS, but AWS is also pretty complex for what I feel is a relatively simple app.
 What would you do? Should I just bite the bullet and finally learn AWS properly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been working with C++ professionally for about a decade, but I've been sticking to knowing as much as I need to in order to write correct and readable code. I'm transferring to a team whose mission is basically: be C++ experts for the rest of the organization. So now I need to know why and how I'm doing what I'm doing.
 What would be the most efficient way to fill in my knowledge gaps? I have gaps in more simple things like the nuances of move semantics, and on the other side of the spectrum I'm pretty unaware of more advanced techniques like metaprogramming beyond the simplest use case. I also need to build a better intuition of how a certain line of code would exactly translate to machine instructions, and fold that intuition into how I write code.
 I've been watching some cppcon videos to start, and I think the next step might be to reread all of the basic C++ books to make sure I fill in all of the more basic unknowns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m part of a team, but frankly I’m the one doing the majority of the work. 
 software engineers and managers just come up to me whenever they have issues because they know my team don’t know how to do anything. 
 It comes to a point where even if I go on vacation for a week or so, they’ll halt some processes until I return because they don’t want my team to break stuff.
 Even when I implement stuff and guide them through it so they follow best practices, they mess things up. They just send their PRs to each other and approve blindly.
 This is because the corporate has a new policy of relocating most r&d to a different region to save money. That region, is not qualified for the job to say the least. 
 I don’t want to fight, really. But I just can’t compromise on stuff like that, they keep damaging my work. And I’ve tried so much to align them with basic standards..
 I can’t revoke my own team’s permissions, I have no one to complain to since they relocated my management to the same region as these employees so it’s a cabal. 
 Is the only choice left is to bail ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. I've been working as an embedded software engineer for about 8 years and wanted to move my career in the direction of backend and cloud. I was just rejected from a role after completing a take home assignment writing a simple RESTful API for a microservice managing one resource. The position was a Golang position (which I admittedly have no experience in) but the assignment did not have to be written in Go. I decided to write it in Go anyways because:
  
I would need to learn the language if I were to be hired for the position anyways.
 
It would be nice to learn a new language and it's ecosystem even if I were to be rejected.
 
 So I poured my heart into learning Go and some select frameworks. I honestly thought I did well enough on the assignment considering it's my first real attempt to write something in Go that isn't absolutely trivial. I was not given any feedback for where I went wrong so I'm left in the dark here. Can any of you give me some feedback on my code? Really appreciate the time.
 https://github.com/brandonto/rest-api-microservice-demo
 EDIT:
 I'd like to thank you all for the enormous feedback. It's heavily appreciated. Never thought that I would have received so much in such a short time frame. I think I have a clear understanding of where the weak points lie now for future projects. I'll definitely be incorporating some of the suggestions in future projects. Perhaps even make changes to this one for the sake of completeness.
 As for the job, while I am a bit disappointed after sinking in hours into this project, I'm just treating it as part of the learning experience.
 I probably won't have the time to respond to any new comments. But I'd like to thank everybody again.
 Golang is a lovely language. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, I joined a company that seemed too laid-back. Despite good pay, I have little responsibility and have to share simplest of tasks with other developers, which creates a lot of overhead for "collaboration." My coworkers often take long lunch breaks or disappear during the day, leaving me blocked.
 Unsurprisingly even minor projects take ages to complete, with many people involved. Now the company is struggling with revenue and talking about running out of funding. Meanwhile, we have well-funded competitors that are executing much more effectively
 I'm not sure what to do. The job market is f'ed, and I don't want to go through the grind again. Talking to the tech leadership would likely either be ignored or get me fired, as they are the ones who set up this enrivonment in the first place and don't see the situation the same way I do.
 What would you do if you were in my shoes?

Just recently we started to reach out to people and looking for playtesters. Finally, we got our first one. A YouTube content creator offered to play our game on twitter.
 Anyway
 As he played, he ran into a lot bugs. While annoying, ( everyone wants their game to be as polished as possible when someone plays it) this wasn’t really the surprising part, instead it was immensely helpful. I wrote them all down to be fixed. Some bugs he found I didn’t even know about, nor would I have been able to find them as breaking your own game is harder than you first think.
 Here's the thing that surprised me. It was when he started asking things like
 "How?"
 "What am I supposed to do right now?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently came across this neat ErrorOr pattern, while looking through SerenityOS, which works like this:
 ErrorOr<Foo> GetFoo() { return Foo{}; } auto foo = TRY( GetFoo() ); 
 The ErrorOr<T> is simply a wrapper around their own variant type (exactly like std::variant as far as i can tell) with is_error, release_error, release_valuefunctions as alternatives to std::holds_variant, and std::get.
 The only thing that im not a big fan of is the way that the TRY macro is implemented (simplified):
 #define TRY(expr)\ ({\ auto&& tmp = (expr);\ if(tmp.is_error())\ return tmp.release_error();\ tmp.release_value()\ }) 
 which only works because of GCC statement expressions (and apparently also works on clang but definitely not on msvc)
 I was wondering if anybody knew of a standard compliant way to implement this maco? Or a msvc equivalent implementation that i could just switch over to when compiling on msvc?

 However i’m concerned that if i do copy the code into the repo, then that code will suddenly become property of the company i work for.
 I’m not sure whether to raise the issue or who/how to raise it.
 Has anyone here navigated this issue before?
 Some thoughts are:
  
I could create an open git repo with the code and publish it as a package with the appropriate license, then install that package in the product at work.
 
See if i can rewrite the code so it works the same way but looks a little different somehow/ or ask an LLM to rewrite and mix it up a bit so it’s not the same syntax 
 
Setup a contract that somehow states that both i and the business have a perpetual license to do whatever we want with the code (even writing it down here sounds stupid and is likely impossible/problematic legally)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am a bit confused. I thought you could never reference something below, only above. And when I write a struct underneath my main but try to use it in main then the code fails as expected. 
 However, if we take the following example:
 class some_class { public: void print_hello() { print_out("Hello"); } private: void print_out(std::string s) { std::cout << s << std::endl; } }; 
 This works, and I am so confused. I can write some_class{}.print_hello(); and it will write out "Hello", but I thought this was not allowed because print_hello() is trying (successfully) to use a function declared below it. 
 Could someone help me understand when and why something must be declared before it can be used?

 So I observed a behavior in development teams. I’m not sure if this has an established name. When teams have changing managers, they might end up having to explain basic things about their work to the newcoming manager. The newcoming manager might not actually listen or understand what’s actually going on in the team, and just tries to adapt a methodology they find matching, or what they bring from their previous experience, without assessing how information actually flows, what are the actual dependencies, constraints, etc.
 Developers will easily just get tired of explaining basic things over and over again. And this is where the attitude kicks in:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been working with a pretty ancient windows desktop application whose initial release date predates me. Its development team recently wrapped some of its functionality as an unmanaged dll for us so that we can incorporate it into our aspnet based microservice application. Currently we are using .net's foreign function interface (PInvoke) to call the library, however it is a bit fragile and we have to meet a few odd requirements like using a thread with a non-standard max stack size.
 I am thinking maybe I should wrap the api calls in a separate program (probably written in c++) to execute c++ calls that I will run in a separate process and use ipc to communicate. This will probably be a bit more robust as I can recover from process crashes and do not need to implement a producer/consumer queue with a separate thread etc. to schedule api calls. However I also feel like I am overcomplicating things. Did any of you had to deal with a similar problem? If so, got any recommendations?

 Is there a relatively inexpensive way of creating/obtaining art assets that doesn't involve AI? I have enough vision to check whether the art is of quality and within the realm of what I want - I don't have enough to draw, not at speed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I've been playing around with designing an API in C++20 for an internal project and stumbled upon what seems like a fresh approach to handling event callbacks. I'm excited about it but unsure if it's a well-known technique. I'd love to get your thoughts and insights on it.
 The Challenge:
 Imagine you have a function Process() that needs to keep others in the loop by firing events like Started, Stopped, and Error during its execution.
 Approach 1: Classic Runtime Interface
 In traditional C++ style, you might set up an interface like this:
 ```cpp struct IObserver { virtual void OnStarted() = 0; virtual void OnStopped() = 0; virtual void OnError(std::string const& error) = 0; };
 void Process(IObserver& observer) { observer.OnStarted(); if (something_went_wrong) { observer.O…]]></summary>

 The only time you should sweat deadlines are if you've been being lazy and intentionally unproductive, and cant provide a reasonable explanation on how it got missed.
 Don't spend what should be a relaxing dinner time pondering if you'll sign in two hours early tomorrow to try to meet some c-suites timeline.
 Those deadlines are for your manager to handle. It is not on you barring you intentionally not trying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know why, but for some reason I have to explain to everyone that higher living expenses don't negate the benefit of a higher wage. Double the income with double the expenses also doubles the savings.
 Your take home pay is basically = (Income - Expenses)
 30,000 = 50,000-20,000 for a good mid-west job (really rough, not realistic)
 double both living and income and we get
 60,000 = 100,000-40,000 for a good city job (really rough, not realistic just an example)
 This is something people in companies also don't know, I think we just accept some statements as truth and leave it at that, but it's not true and just requires basic math. If both of the only variables go up, then any result of that variable will also shoot up, so THP = (Income-Expenses) is the same as 2THP = 2(Income-Expenses).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data suggests employees are feeling trapped and ready to quit. 85% of professionals are looking for a new job. The current regime of low attrition is ready to break as job satisfaction ticks down. Employers seem convinced they're back in control of the market however they're soon going to be faced with massive turnover and the costs that go with that. As this turnover ramps up employers will be once again competing with each other to attract and retain talent. The pendulum swung too hard and too fast back to employers and now it's likely to swing back just as hard. The volatility in the job market is set to continue for years to come and this is a real opportunity for those unphased by it.
 My question for many of you is: Are you looking for a job and why? Planning to hold on for dear life? Are you burnt out?

 i dont know what more to say, because i have no idea why its not working. for the sake of this reddit post, ive gotten rid of the if/else which gets rid of the targeted name because that works, its just the scanning which is a problem.
 i havent tried formatting code before so if i do it wrong lmk

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is actually insane how many people are doing this , so after I posted on /INAT in like 10mins I got Two people on discord trying to scam me to pay 200$ -> 250$ for Ai generated art , btw they take zero effort coming up with the images as a portfolio each image with completely different art style and they dont even rename the image they leave the 11efa8adf4d35f69d60261cf676c8a2a type name , and you can just reverse search with google image and they will 90% come up in pinterest (some of them don't because they are Ai generated) .
 (a bit of contest they showed me your usual Ai generated looking art, then I asked them for pixl art and they literally just Googled PIXL ART and just sent me the first images that came up ,and one of the even sent me image with the Ai logo on it and he deleted it too fast so I couldn't take screenshot )
 So until now it's okay but when I started confronting them ,they started to deny and when I pulled up the screenshots of reverse searching they told me that ,no we made them long time ago and when keept denying it .
 eventually they admitted that they used images from pinterest for the pixl art but not the other "Ai generated looking art " and i kept pushing them until they stopped talking to me ,and one of them literally said "If you use my artwork elsewhere, I will report you." and asked me if I am algerian for some reason which I am , maybe he thought he would scare me or something like that ,And they went to my reddit post and Down voted it to try hurting me or whatever xd .
 Conclusion :
 Those scamers have insane resilience.
 But actually on the serious note, always look out for new made Discord acounts and basically all Ai generated looking art , and of course always reverse search them to make sure

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science and expect to graduate in the next six months. My background includes an undergrad degree in Computer Science and several software engineering internships. I have a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming using Java, as well as web and mobile development with technologies like React and Node.js.
 While I consider myself proficient in developing products, I’m aware that the rise of workflow automation might impact the relevance of some skills I currently possess. To stay ahead, I’m planning to deepen my expertise in C programming and explore branches such as embedded programming and advanced uses of C/C++.
 I have a decent handle on solving LeetCode problems and a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms. However, I aim to achieve a deeper understanding of programming and want to have skills that can make me a better developer and a valuable employee.
 I’m here to ask for advice and pointers from those with more experience. Should I focus on C/C++ for embedded systems, or are there other areas within systems programming I should consider? I am also taking a Computer Systems course on the side. I appreciate all the feedbacks I can get - roadmaps, youtube series, project ideas, literally anything. Thank you. 
 PS - I am also trying to explore if I really like programming in C in long-term so I want to go in-depth. I can put in work but I am not sure about the path to follow.

It's of course a lot easier to do this when you have a matrix of dimension 2^n, so I could pad this with zeros to make it 128x128 instead. Is there a way to do this simply? What sides does the padding with zeros go on? 
 Also, I am currently using a vector of vectors to store my matrix essentially. Does this make a difference to how I would go about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm trying to follow the Vulkan tutorial, yet I'm coding in C instead of C++. Additionally, I'm coding in Visual Studio with the horrible MSVC compiler which doesnt allow me to simply write `VkPhysicalDevice devices[deviceCount]`.
 No problem, I thought, I'm just going to use malloc.
 Yes problem. For whatever reason, this fails spectacularily (Access violation writing location ...), no clue why.
 uint32_t deviceCount = 0;
 vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(*instance, &deviceCount, 0);
 VkPhysicalDevice *devices = malloc(sizeof(VkPhysicalDevice) * deviceCount);
 vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(*instance, &deviceCount, devices);
 Whereas this works fine.
 uint32_t deviceCount = 0;
 vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(*instance, &deviceCount, 0);
 VkPhysicalDevice devices[2]; // in my case deviceCount is 2
 vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(*instance, &deviceCount, devices);
 From my understanding, there shouldn't be a difference as arrays are basically pointers to memory space anyways... Can anyone explain?

(Clocked in a total of 95 interviews and over 1200 applications before I finally got an offer.)
 Now, roughly 4 months into the new position, our CEO is stepping down to a different role, and our CFO is leaving altogether. The CFO has been in the position for only 7 months.
 Am I right to be paranoid about the company's stability, or am I overreacting?

It can also print out the function that wraps over it and the function that wraps over the function that wraps over it... spreading out the whole calling hierarchy onto the terminal. In this way, when debugging, I can quickly locate which line is doing the complaining by clicking the link on my terminal.
 The code is here: https://github.com/Yifeeeeei/butterknife
 A quick example here, the comments show the output:
 package main ​ import ( "github.com/Yifeeeeei/butterknife" ) ​ func main() { a := "a" b := "b" butterknife.Print(a, b) // [main.go:10 main.main] ab ​ butterknife.Println(a, b) // [main.go:13 main.main] a b ​ butterknife.Printf("a:%s ,b:%s\n", a, b) // [main.go:16 main.main] a:a ,b:b ​ caller() } ​ func caller() { c := "c" d := "d" butterknife.PrintHierarchy(c, d) // [main.go:19 main.main] // [main.go:25 main.caller] // cd ​ butterknife.PrintlnHierarchy(c, d) // [main.go:19 main.main] // [main.go:30 main.caller] // c d ​ butterknife.PrintfHierarchy("c:%s ,d:%s\n", c, d) // [main.go:19 main.main] // [main.go:35 main.caller] // c:c ,d:d } ​ 
 Right now it only supports 12 different styles (print with fmt/log, print/printf/println, with/without hierarchy), but I may add more functionalities to it later.

 I'm a frontend engineer / programmer with 10 years' experience in Unity, 8+ shipped games, and a few years of unreal 3-5 experience from side projects over the years.
 I was laid off twice last year, and I have not gotten as much as an interview in 6 months of applying since. I can't keep going like this, hoping something is going to work out.
 I paid (finally in full) $150,000 for a Software Engineering degree from RIT that did not have 1 class explaining what a server was or teaching us web development (weirdly we had one class Enterprise Architecture class teaching patterns like Join tables with no context for how to write database queries).
 What's left of the industry has forced me out. I will never give up gamedev as a hobby, but I need a way to make money. Every software engineering job I can find now is an unrecognizable alphabet soup of technologies, usually requiring senior developers with backend experience.
 What do I do? Where do I start learning to make myself marketable?
 (P.S. giant middle finger to every live service for soaking up every moment and dollar from the players they exploit, driving the success / profitability bar so high that nothing I recognize as a game will have a fair shot of being funded by a major publisher ever again)

The notion that Rust is a tough language puts people from even trying, including my past self. This is particularly relevant for those who, like me, have primarily worked with GC'd languages (I've only ever completed one semester course in C++ and never used it professionally).
 For me, the learning curve for Rust wasn't as steep as it was for other programming paradigms I've used extensively, such as logic or pure functional programming. It only took me an evening or two to get somewhat comfortable with Rust, and within a week I was able to finish the book and complete a couple of projects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi so I've seen a lot of posts discussing similar questions about the best CI/CD but what confuses me is that people a lot of times suggest GitLab CI and GitHub Actions, are they meaning that they should change SCM providers as well? Or are they saying they should create a copy of their repository in GitLab/GitHub and pay the costs of two providers just to use the pipeline? Currently I'm in a team using Jira and Confluence so I think it makes sense for us to go with BitBucket since code review can easily be done in a way that ties to user stories and it is discounted with our other Atlassian products. Why don't more people that use Jira use BitBucket? And what is the best option for a company using Jira? Do we copy our BitBucket repo to GitLab, do we use GitLab and use a Jira integration but still not have our code review be able to be tied to user stories, or do we use a CI/CD manager like Jenkins which most people agree is complex to manage? What are other people doing for this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

This PM consistently schedules last minute meetings and meetings scattered throughout the day, making it extremely difficult to get into flow state and get any actual work done. The PM consistently wants to meet AFTER a meeting with the client so that I can help them understand what happened and fill out their status report since they are not technical and don’t understand what is going on. This happens multiple times a week. Projects are now having to be extended, part of which is because of the fact that my time is consistently being wasted in meetings, or meetings to discuss meetings from earlier. I’ve spoken to my manager about this, and my manager supports me managing my own time. What should I do to set the expectation that I will not use half of my week on meetings that are a waste of time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I'm working on a CPP application which generate some QML code. My software is a TTRPG CharacterSheet editor, where users can design the charactersheet. There is a UI to design it then you can generate the QML code, and the user may want to do some modifications on the generated code (I need the code to be well-indented).
 I'm looking for any tips or methods to generate this code and replace placeholders with value.
 Currently, I'm using QString and arg parameters. But I find this solution complex to maintain and the code is kind of ugly.
 One example: The imageField ```cpp bool QmlGeneratorVisitor::generateImage(FieldController* item) { if(!item) return false;
 QString text("%4ImageField {//%1\n" "%5" "%4 source: %2.value\n" "%4 color: \"%3\"\n" + getPageManagement(item, m_indenSpace) + "%4 readOnly: %2.readOnly\n" + generatePosition(item) + "%4}\n"); m_out << text.arg(item->label()) //%1 .arg(getId(item)) .arg(item->bgColor().name(QColor::HexArgb)) .arg(m_indenSpace) //%4 .arg(m_isTable ? QStringLiteral("") : QStringLiteral("%1 id: _%2\n").arg(m_indenSpace).arg(getId(item))); return true; 
 } ``` %1 -> name of the field %2 -> id of the field %3 -> background color %4 -> indentation space %5 -> generation of the QML id (based on item id)
 Do you have any solution or tips: could be a way to organize or even some libraries…

The dream is to write an emulator for the NES, but I don't have a lot of experience with low level programming, so I started with Chip-8, since it is pretty much the "Hello, World" of emulators.
 I just pushed the final commit of my project on GitHub. I would very much like some feedback on it. Even nitpicking is welcome. Anything I can use when I eventually start working on an NES emulator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was laid off while I am pregnant (4 months). Received a good severance (12 weeks). Started applying, but I am getting no call backs. I am only applying for remote since I assume they wouldn’t want to hire me pregnant.
 My resume( format got a little bit screwed since I anonymized it)
 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FkoQ5xQxubdE5n8-LV-u2X8XxIS1rehGZycyiW-2Fas/edit
 Any idea why I am not getting any call backs. When I applied in 2021, my resume was way worse than this yet I got 5 interviews the first week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically every language I've worked with so far has been ok with dependency management. You need a library, you install that library, you use it. Sometimes there's version conflicts and such, but that's not what I'm talking about here. In Python: pip install; in JS: npm install; in Rust: add it to Cargo.toml; Java: POM File. These are what I worked with, and I know there's other ways to do it in each one, but still, it's basically "hey, I need to use this" "ok". But with cpp, every single time I've had to deal with some dependency it's been a huge effort to try and relearn cmake, or having to go manually after library files, have compilers screaming at me that it can't find something that's RIGHT THERE. 
 So, what's the deal? Is there something I'm missing here? I really hope so, please let me know how wrong I am.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure if this question is quite r/ExperiencedDevs enough, but hoping so since I really would like some input from everyone.
 I've got 7 years of experience and a strong resume. Historically, I've had no problem getting a job quickly. I've been looking for half a year now and nothing. I'm wondering if the salaries have fallen enough that I need to lower my expectations or if the job market really is just that tight right now. I also do have the slight complication of I'm trying to find a job that's just a smidge out of my current wheelhouse - is that just not an option right now?
 Not looking to vent or anything -- just want some advice from people who have done this recently to put together a plan of action. Don't currently have a job, so waiting until the market changes isn't an option.
 The real question I'm asking though -- those of you who have gotten a new job in the last 6 months or so -- What was your prep like? What were the offers like? How is anybody getting new positions right now?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm planning to start adding audio rendering into my Gameboy emulator and have a few questions:
  
For some background, my emulator assumes that all devices will be clocked every machine cycle (70224 cycles/frame). So, I'm using that clock to determine when to generate the next audio sample. Is there a better way to do this?
 Currently I generate an entire frame of audio data and then sending that data to SDL when it renders the video frame (~60 audio frames/sec). But I'm having issues finding a good sample rate that divisible by the machine cycles. I did find 264 machine cycles/audio sample, which gives 266 audio samples/frame -> 15,960 audio samples/sec. But this doesn't seem optimal. Any suggestions on how I could improve this?
  
Edit: Fixed units in 1. from cycles/sec -> cycles/frame

 In my experience these can be heavy compute cost wise and this can also add up maintenance wise. I've in the past merged a few of these environments to reduce maintenance cost.
 How do you work around this?

 I always used Valgrind to detect memory errors and it works fine IMO but it's a bit slow, hence,
 i decided to try Gcc Sanitizer which seems to be more fast but there are some cases for which it doesn't detect memory leaks.
 For example, I had a global variable in my program which was heap allocated and gcc sanitizer can't detected it.
 For other cases instead, it works.
 Had anyone a similar experience ?
 Best regards.

 I'm based in the UK/europe, so for American readers just replace the numbers in your brain with a higher equivalent, rather than commenting on the actual numbers. Because the numbers aren't the point. Just think of "what you personally consider a high salary".
 My previous job paid very well. I was making more than £100k + decent benefits, which is something like top 1-2% of UK salaries. And in my head this number was a representation of success. Most people don't earn that much so I must be more successful than most people. I've never thought of myself as materialistic but I enjoyed feeling that …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever I had an experienced technical project lead, things have been incredible. 
 Whenever I’ve had non-technical managers doing their Agile thing, I’ve HATED my life. 
 Technical leads would jump straight into a problem and either unblock us or understand immediately why things are taking so long or why something can’t be done. They are focused on quality, they care about the software and where it is going. Non-technical managers want things done in X amount of time and you need to explain to them like they’re 5 why it hasn’t been done yet. 
 How am I supposed to respect someone and essentially report to them when they know nothing about technology? 
 These are roles to whip the employees to work harder, slaves overlooking other slaves. They’re there to force devs to give themselves deadlines and burn themselves out. 
 Yes, there are also technical managers who aren’t good managers. Imo you need to be both good at management and good at technology, if you’re good at just one of these, you’re automatically not good enough. Your lack in the other area will show up. The definition of a leader, to me, is someone you look up to, who can do at least everything that you do and more. 
 This industry is a bit of a joke, not surprised that people can’t take us seriously when we call ourselves “engineers”. It seems like everyone who knows how to send an email and takes one course can come in and start managing projects. No wonder this industry is flooded and sinking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I came up with this error-handling pattern in C:
 The return type of a function is a struct with an "is_error" bool, and a union of the error, or the data you want to return. The error can contain an enum so the specific errors can be resolved in code, and a char* to a descriptive error message for easier debugging. What do you think? Do you use something similar, or have a better way of handling errors?
 Here's some example code which can be run in godbolt:
 ​
 #include <stdlib.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdbool.h> #define _STRINGIFY(x) #x #define STRINGIFY(x) _STRINGIFY(x) #define ERROR_STRING(string_literal) "ERROR in "__FILE__ " line #" STRINGIFY(__LINE__) string_literal typedef struct { bool is_error; union { struct { enum {MakeEggs_error_TemperatureLow, MakeEggs_error_…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a senior dev at my company and was pulled onto a project to deliver a more complicated requirement. While doing this, I realised the more junior dev had missed a lot of functionality and requirements in his build. So he was taken off the project and I was assigned to do a non-billable rework.
 For context, I am a Salesforce developer and the project is complex integration. The client insisted we use a 3rd party tool and deliver the project using SSIS packages. I was not involved at the start or in the sales cycle so had no opportunity to argue against this. I have no experience using SSIS packages and neither does anyone in our company. This isn't a project we should have taken on. 
 I have been working for a couple of weeks to try to save the project but at this point I don't think I can do it. I don't have enough knowledge on SSIS packages and the 3rd party software the client wants us to use. I have learned a lot about them but at this point, the skills required to deliver are not ones I have and I don't have a lot of time to really learn them. 
 Does anyone else have experiences like this? I pride myself on being able to teach myself and adapt so it doesn't feel great to admit I'm not capable.
 UPDATE: There is some really great advice in this thread and it's good to know I am not the only one this has happened to. I took some of the advice here on board and had a meeting with my deliver director and PM lead where I explained the problem and gave some solutions rather than a flat out "I can't do this". These included me taking extra time to learn about SSIS, hiring a contractor or restructuring the project into a more manageable phased approach. Now it is up to them to have the difficult conversation with the customer!

 My game is a point and click adventure, so I’m in pretty niche territory, but I’m fairly pleased with the momentum so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since I started making games, people around me are creating "Game Ideas" and asking me to implement them. Without any context. Without understanding market, game design and mechanics, scope and cost. It's especially irritating because mostly family and friends have that "great ideas" and I can't tell them to go away (usually).
 To anyone doing this and not understanding why gamedev usually don't pick up your ideas.
 Everyone have "ideas". I can literally from the top of my head in 1h give you 20 games ideas. 1 idea every 3 minutes. But ideas without full context, are not worth much. It's because every idea need days or weeks of actual work to create a design and validate if it's a good to make a game from it. With mechanics working together, with story, with scenario, with checking if similar games exist, with validating if mechanics are really working, if they are fun. And most of the time because of details in game design it will turn out "the idea" is not working. If you come to a gamedev with an "idea", understand that what really gamedev sees is not a solution, but a problem. You are basically asking someone to spend dozens of hours, maybe days or weeks to validate if "the idea" makes sense.
 If you want to cooperate with someone making games, make a full game design instead**.** Do the leg work. Prepare full concept. Check market. Play many games in genre of game from your "idea". Validate the concept as much as you can. Find assets. Learn what GDD is. If game is story driven - learn how to write. Write short stories first and check with audience your writing. Then write a story for your "idea". I mean - depending on the game type, spend at least 100-300h of work before you start talking to someone making games. Then be prepared to put another hundreds of hours of working closely with a gamedev.
 Ideas are cheap. 1 "idea" is created in 3 minutes.
 Full concepts are worth much more. But still the biggest cost is in making a game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The best convention I suppose is the one that is currently being used in the project. But when starting a new project or writing your own hobby code that you want to look professional, and you want to be up to date, which of the following should be done for C++?
  
snake_case vs CamelCase: Seems everyone agrees on CamelCase for naming structs and classes, but for namespaces, functions/methods, and fields/variables I have seen both and am I bit confused as to which is "best" or most "standard."
 m_variable vs _variable vs variable: a) When implementing member variables of a class, is there a standard for starting with m_, _, or nothing? b) Should a public member start with uppercase a la C# properties? c) Are the answers the same for structs?
 variable_ptr vs variable: When a variable is a pointer, what is the standard to add _ptr to its name, not add _ptr to its name, or do whatever increases readability the most for that specific code snippet?
 g_variable vs variable: When a variable is global for a file, is it standard to add g_ in front of its name?
 get_/set_variable() vs variable(): When implementing getter and setter functions, is it typically better (or more standard) to include "get" and "set" in the function name or to just write out the name? E.g. get_success_count() vs success_count().

 HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40304549
 Excerpt:
  
Choosing colocation for the infrastructure was the right decision for Ahrefs. Reflecting on the past six years, the data centers with our own servers and network cost us $122 million, a figure that would have ballooned to an astronomical $1.1 billion if we had opted for the cheapest AWS cloud offering. Our powerful on-prem servers enable our developers to focus on enhancing our products for clients, rather than getting caught in a never-ending cycle of trying to optimize cloud costs with little hope of success.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was refactoring my asset code in my engine and noticed that objects were randomly being destroyed and I completely blanked on how ownership, references, and non reference/pointer values work which I think is the issue I'm running into. I have a global struct with a few containers for each asset type and then a load function for each asset type ``` struct Assets { std::map<size_t, Model> models; std::map<size_t, Texture> textures; std::map<size_t, ShaderProgram> shaders; };
 ShaderProgram loadShader(Assets& assets, const std::string& vertexPath, const std::string& fragmentPath); Model loadModel(Assets& assets, const std::string& filePath); Texture loadTexture(Assets& assets, const char* filePath);
 ``` These functions hash the filepath (which is the new thing I was trying out) to use as a unique id and then if not already loaded loads it and returns the asset. I believe everything is being copied right now so I'm not working with the original object which causes them to constantly be deleted and not be rendered on screen so to fix this I just need the maps to store a smart pointer and the load functions return a smart pointer?
 For future reference is there a way to remember this sort of stuff for example whenever an object is needed outside the scope should I be working with pointers?

In the last chapter about the Unix system, there is a part about building the fopen function with system calls. In this, we use some kind of internal flags, for example, _READ instead of O_RDONLY. In the implementation, it uses both the POSIX and the internal flags. As I understand it, it uses both because in order to detect if some FILE has write privileges, for example, you can intersect bits, and if the intersection is different than 0, it has the privilege. However, this breaks when using O_RDONLY because it has the value 0, so it is not possible to detect if a combination of flags has the O_RDONLY flag with this aproach.
 So my question is, why does POSIX start with 0 instead of 1 and shift the rest by 2*n?
 (Maybe the answer is obvious, but I don't see it.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had my 1 on 1 with my manager today. We have had an open for another senior engineer on my team, so I was asking about the status of it. For almost a year I've been a part of a leadership program to help get me promoted to lead. I've gotten a lot of positive feedback along the way and told that I'm making great progress. According to my manager, because of some of the work that we have coming up in the near future 1. that senior role that I mentioned got bumped to lead (we already have a lead) and 2. they made a pitch for me but ultimate was denied by my skip because there's a "local" candidate in the pipeline.
 All things considered I'm taking it in stride. I wasn't expecting to be promoted this soon anyway and this unfortunately lines up with the company direction of moving to more in-office / hybrid. There are a bunch of people that were hired (and still are) remote - seniors / leads / principals / managers / directors - one of whom is my manager. Most people still don't go into the office except on rare occasions like vertical get togethers where remote folks fly in too.
 I really enjoy working for the company that I do, so the game plan for now is just to keep kicking butt and make myself undeniable for promo. Looking elsewhere for a lead / staff job has crossed my mind, but I have an agreement with myself that I'll wait until 5 years before doing that (currently sitting at 3 and some change at my current level). Moving back to where the company is based out of has also crossed my mind - I used to live there, but moved back to my home state to be closer to family during the pandemic.
 I'm curious - have y'all run into similar situations? How have you handled it? Also, I have a 1 on 1 with my skip level in a month who denied my promo. Any tips? They're new to me because of a re-org, so it'll be the first time we've met. I've known of them for a while.

 I’ve been working on my next project, "Planetaries," an open-world sci-fi TD survival game. You’re probably wondering what the TD part is all about. Well, it’s a significant aspect of the game where you defend your base and earn Tech Points to unlock new technology in your tech tree. However, it’s not a necessity; you can choose to farm your own way, explore, or complete contracts to obtain technology. The game also supports multiplayer.
 Teaser:
 In the teaser footage, I’m showcasing some of the environments, gathering mechanics, alien life, points of interest, combat, player base interactions, character movement, overall feel, and theme of the game.
 Feedback:
 I’d like to hear your thoughts on all these aspects, including the graphics.
 Development Teaser [on the Steam page]:

 Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

 ch = 'अ' print(ord(ch)) //Outputs 2309, which is the decimal conversion of its Unicode representation, 0905 
 Also the .encode() function to convert it into its Unicode representation
 ch = 'अ' 
 unicode_rep = ch.encode('ascii', "backslashreplace") print(unicode_rep) //Outputs b'\u0905 of type byte
 However, when I try the static_cast<int> function in C++ it throws a warning:
 int main(){ char ch = 'अ'; int i = static_cast<int>(ch); cout << i; 
 }
 The output:
 unicode.cpp:7:15: warning: multi-character character constant [-Wmultichar] 7 | char ch = 'αñm; | ^~~ 
 unicode.cpp: In function 'int main()': unicode.cpp:7:15: warning: overflow in conversion from 'int' to 'char' changes value from '14722181' to '-123' [-Woverflow]
 -123

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm a scientific programmer. I primarily use Python and FORTRAN. I have to write a code that involves solving a finite difference equation on multidimensional vector array. 
 (1) Defining a multidimensional array: The array is electric field with three components (ex, ey, ez) defined at (Nx, Ny, Nz) grid. Where Nx, Ny and Nz are the number of points along X, Y and Z. So if Nx, Ny, and Nz = 10, 9, 8 my array will be [10, 9, 8, 3] shape. 
 Then I have to define gradient along all the three axes and solve some numerical equations which involves matrix multiplications. 
 I have done this in Python and it was straight forward using Numpy Ndarrays. 
 I recently tried porting my code to C++. I realised that defining multidimensional arrays in C++ is not so straightforward. 
 What is the fastest and easiest method to implement such a multidimensional array in c++? 
 Any advice is helpful.

 2. if you dont include the headers you actually get materially different assembly. it wont inline those function calls and considering they are like 2 istructions thats a major loss
 3. you can actually get quite far with essentially guessing what the implementation should be. they are actually about what I would expect like I seen movsd and thought "i bet you can memov with that" turns out I was right

 Most interesting is how file structure, partitioning and layer interaction is organized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Folks!
 I am starting off with C as my first ever programming language. (I have some prior programming experience with C and Python but never managed to go pass the basics. Hopefully I will get to a point where I can do something useful with these languages around this time)
 Nonetheless, I am following the classic "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. In the introductory chapter (A TUTORIAL INTRODUCTION - Page 6), the first example to print Hello World goes something like this:
 # include <stdio.h> main () { printf("Hello, world\n"); } 
 When I compiled it with the cc or gcc compiler, an error was produced:
 error: return type defaults to 'int' 
 Naturally, I went back to the thought process that I had in my previous attempts at learning C. I simply declared the return type for the main() function to be void and it compiled successfully. The changed code goes like this:
 # include <stdio.h> void main () { printf("Hello, world\n"); } 
 What am I missing out from the example? Has it something to do with the Compiler Version that I am on? Or is it something entirely different?

 Raptor offers similar performance and capabilities to thrust, but offers a more abstract interface. Raptor provides a set of smart containers (vector, array, vector, scalar) and skeletons (map, reduce, scan, filter, sort) that can be applied over the smart containers. Containers can store the data both on the host (CPU) and device (GPU), and expose a seemingly unified memory address space. Skeletons are executed on the device. Containers are automatically and lazily allocated and synchronized whenever a skeleton is executed.

 Also when initializing two variables, i and j, and trying to print a[7] and a[8], both will print 0 on my VS code, but prints values of j and i respectively. On an online compiler, the output changes each time it is run.

The teacher was a mathematician, but he seemed to me very knowledgeable in the area of programming also. He taught us that it was convenient not to name iterators with only one letter. I found this good advice myself, so i usually name iterators 'ix' instead of 'i', and so on. Why have I never seen this convention anywhere else?

 I had a similar problem with only the <format> header, but after updating GCC, this applies to all standard headers. Is anyone else experiencing the same issue? Is this due to a conflict between GCC and Clang (libstdc++ versus libc++, perhaps)?
 Edit: Apparently, passing `-D_Float32=float` to clang-tidy supresses those errors.

 So far, I've had a pretty transparent relationship with my manager (who is also the CTO btw). Do you think telling him that I'm looking for opportunities outside the company can brutally backfire ? I dont have any offers in hand and I may be at the company for a significant amount of time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I lead a team of 8 people in a large company (more than 10k employees). My manager was out on vacation for 2 weeks and before she returned, I went on vacation for 2 weeks. So there’s an overlap of 1 week where we were both on vacation. Both vacation times were planned a month or two ago. 
 There are a couple of key initiatives for our company that my team is working on, and I’ve notified in an email about who to reach out to in my absence, while copying the respective individuals. My automated out of office response also mentions these individuals.
 My team was merged under her a few months ago and she doesn’t have a lot of understanding of our product/service. 
 She returned this week and has been reaching out to me via text asking me to look at my Teams chat/email and provide updates on various topics which she needs to pass on to her boss and a couple of other key stakeholders. I understand her situation and indulged her the other day, but now this is becoming an every day thing.
 How do I be supportive of her situation while also not rubbing her the wrong way? Given the market situation, I don’t want to be fired for sounding rude when asking them not to bother me during my time off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[*SOLVED*
 In my member functions, some of them return type 'Vector'. However, i did not specify the parameters for the return type. Thus instead of simply
 template <typename type>
 Vector Vector<type>::operator + (Vector v2) const
 I must declare it as:
 template <typename type>
 Vector<type> Vector<type>::operator + (Vector v2) const
 I was using a "concrete" return type 'Vector', but this type is parameterized, hence why the compiler complains, it doesnt know what parameter to use for the return type. 
 Here is my header file "Vector.h"
 #ifndef VECTOR_H #define VECTOR_H #include <cmath> #include <stdio.h> #define PI 3.14159265 #define RadConv PI/180.0; #define DegConv 180.0/PI; template <typename type> class Vector { private: type x1; type x2; type x3; bool Is3dVector; public: Vector(t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't do it. I'm actually not joking, If I had a time machine to 15 years ago, sigh
 Though if the hubris does overwhelm, pick an easier game genre, Something one person can do, no matter how brilliant you think you are, you really are not. Still it could of been worse I could of chosen a MMORPGGGGGH
 Don't make a major gameplay change midway (I done 2 on this game adventure, turn based -> realtime & dungeons -> Open World). Lesson learnt, If the game ain't happening, scrap it and start something new, don't try to shoehorn what you have into this cause it will bite you in the ass later 
 Don't roll your own code. i.e re-invent the wheel, Sure this is oldhat advice. But take it from an oldfart, dont. I went from my own engine in c++/opengl & my own physics engine -> my engine + ODE -> Unity & C#. I wasn't cool rolling my own, I was just a dick wasting hours, hours that could of been useful realizing my dream 
  
Positive advice:
  
Only 2 rules in programming
 #1 KISS - Always keep it simple, you may think you're smart doing some shortcut or elegant solution, but 50% of the time you're creating problems down the track, why roll the dice, play it smart. OK this is a mantra but #2 is not well known
 #2 Treat everything as equal. AKA - don't make exceptions, no matter how much sense they appear to make, inevitably it will bite you in the ass later
 Now I still violate both the rules even now (after 40 years of programming) So this is do as I say, not as I do thing
 Don't be afraid to go out of your comfort zone. Myself, In the last couple of years, I've (with my GF) had my child, something I swear I would never do (It happened though) & gone to help in Ukraine. Both totally unrelated BTW

 class Trace {

 std::uniform_real_distribution<> dist{ 0.0, 1.0 };

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have never used threading before, but I would like to learn. I have a program in C++ which generates small crossword boards and it's quite calculation heavy. It's a backtracking algorithm so basically it explores one path, backtracks, tries another, backtracks, etc. Therefore I could see the benefit of exploring multiple paths at the same time, using threading.
 However in practice I don't really know how much threading would speed things up. Threading is used for I/O operations involving waiting, but there's no waiting involved here, so would it even be useful? Furthermore, how many threads could I get away with creating? I couldn't tell you if 10 or 100 is a good number of threads for one program.

 It would consist of a back office and public facing website that serves data managed in the back office.
 It would not have any performance critical parts, such as realtime computing, concurent actions or server to server communication.
 My major concern with golang would be speed of development cycle and how well would it behave in a startup environvment with ever changing requirements?
 Another thing would be how easy or costly would it be to find good Golang talent with limited budget of a startup?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working as a lead. All my team mates are at least 10 years junior to me. They respect me and I am driving this team. I also get approached frequently for technical issues they face. 
 But I find it hard to mix with them like I can with colleagues my age. They also tend to be serious in front of me and rarely invite me for tea breaks or unofficial lunches they plan.
 My personality is not at all dominating. (In appraisal review, I keep getting comments that I should be more assertive.) I am little introvert but I still try to lighten the environment and for a moment we are good but then after few minutes everything goes back to earlier stage.
 My concern is this will slowly cut me off from the team especially in future when they will not need my help in solving technical issues.
 Has anyone faced such issues? Is there anything I can do about this or should I just accept this and not worry about it?
 Edit: I am the lead and not a manager. It's not an official position. But I am supposed to lead the team because of domain and product knowledge.

It is cycled indefinitely at a first line. I am curious as to why this is, because it's odd that someone who developed C would write bogus program in the guide to learn it. I am editing in Visual studio code and GCC compiler and have all the updates installed for C/C++ libraries.
 This is the code I wrote exactly as is in the book:
 #include <stdio.h> main() { int fahr, celsius; int lower, upper, step; lower = 0; upper = 300; step = 20; fahr = lower; while (fahr <= upper) { celsius = 5 * (fahr - 32) / 9; printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius); fahr, fahr + step; } }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 I’ve recently started taking the Nand2Tetris course. I am currently in week 6 of the first course, which deals mainly with hardware.
 This week though, it is required to build an assembler, which is the first software above the hardware. The course teachers say it can be built with any programming language, like Java and Python.
 The thing is, right now I am mostly familiar with C, but I am also not an expert. I’ve programmed in Python on the past, but I will need to refresh, as I have used C more lately.
 But should I build the assembler, and maybe the next required software (I think it is a VM and a compiler), with C? Like isn’t it too complicated because of all the memory management you have to consider, no classes (as opposed to C++) etc.?
 Also, if you’re familiar with this course, I would like to consult with you if you think I should proceed to the second part? Or take CS50x before, which I have heard is very good for starting out with programming? Is Nand2Tetris part 2 recommended in general?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So it is fully possible to use #define with parenthesis to, for instance, make a an add "function" like this:
 #define ADD(x, y) ((x) + (y)) void foo() { std::cout << ADD(3, 7) << std::endl; } 
 My first question here, is this good or bad C++ practice? I've heard that "macros are evil" but don't fully understand why or what it even means.
 On the the real question of the post, is it possible to use #define with curly brackets? I might give some of you a heart attack now so let's just view this as an example. Is it possible to do something like this:
 #define private_namespace{a} namespace{a} private_namespace{ void some_function() {...} int some_other_function() {...} } 
 In this case you might say "Why not just write #define private_namespace namespace?" to which my answer is a) this is more of a hypothetical question for learning purposes and b) then the coder could write private_namespace some_namespace {...} instead of namespace some_namespace {...}.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Yall, 
 I'm curious on your opinions on the right relationship between fullstack developers and sre when it comes to ownership of load balancing and security services (authorization, EDR, etc.)?
 In this case our fullstack team owns development of a customer facing product which includes our SAAS API and various front ends. The API is composed of micro-services. It does biz logic things like user management, fetching results, ingesting media inputs and passing them into our core engine which is owned by MLEs... 
 We are a small startup, I am the first and only devops engineer at the moment. I initially wrote authorization and owned load balancing into the system but out of feeling that I was spread too thin I passed this ownership off to the fullstack team. My sense over the past few months is that the fullstack team shouldn't ideally own load balancing and authorization, they tend to do things really quickly and dirtily and I suppose I'm not fully comfortable with their approach. My sense is that this should be owned by security minded SREs who are already responsible for production.
 Can you guys assist in providing insight into my potential blindspots? What are your thoughts?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ctreg (pronounced cuh-tredge) is a library for compile-time regular expressions the way they were always meant to be: at compile time! It's a macro that takes a regular expression and produces two things:
  
A type containing the compiled internal representation of the regular expression, or as close as we can get given the tools available to us. This means no runtime errors and faster regex object construction.
 A type containing all of the named capture groups in the expression, and a captures method that infallibly captures them. Unconditional capture groups are always present when a match is found, while optional or alternated groups appear as Option<Capture>. This is a significant ergonomic improvmenet over fallibly accessing groups by string or integer key at runtime.
  
Interestingly, we currently don't do any shenanigans with OnceLock or anything similar. That was my original intention, but because the macro can't offer anything meaningful over doing it yourself, we've elected to adopt the principles of zero-cost abstractions for now and have callers opt-in to whatever object management pattern makes the most sense for their use case. In the future I might add this if I can find a good, clean pattern for it.
 This version is 1.0, but I still have plenty of stuff I want to add. My current priority is reaching approximate feature pairity with the regex crates: useful cargo features for tuning performance and unicode behavior, and a more comprehensive API for variations on find operations.

 include <stdio.h>
 define Resultt(T, E) struct Result##T##_##E { bool is_ok; union { T value; E error; }; }
 define Ok(T, E) (struct Result##T####E){ .is_ok = true, .value = (T) _OK_IMPL
 define OK_IMPL(...) __VA_ARGS_ }
 define Err(T, E) (struct Result##T####E){ .is_ok = false, .error = (E) _ERR_IMPL
 define ERR_IMPL(...) __VA_ARGS_ }
 typedef const char *ErrorMessage_t;
 Result_t(int, ErrorMessage_t) my_func(int i) { if (i == 42) return Ok(int, ErrorMessage_t)(100); else return Err(int, ErrorMessage_t)("Cannot do the thing"); }
 int main() { Result_t(int, ErrorMessage_t) x = my_func(42);
 if (x.is_ok) { printf("%d\n", x.value); } else { printf("%s\n", x.error); } 
 } ```

 But by "merging" the .cpp and .h files in a single module file, that file will contain all the imports / includes, which will increase the chance of circular dependencies.
 I know that we can still use forward declarations with modules, but now we would be required to not only forward declare a class, but also its methods that we want to use.
 What's the best way to avoid this issue when using modules?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm pretty new to cpp and am trying to work out the best design for a problem I'm having. I'm wondering if shared pointers are the way to go. 
 The problem: I have a class that makes an expensive database query during construction. The information retrieved is static though and most of the class functions don't even depend on the data. Furthermore, a class instance might be constructed multiple times during a single call from the upstream application , and each time this expensive and often unnecessary db call is made.
 My idea: Lazy load the db query only when it's first needed and then store the data in a global cache that will exist for the entirety of the application call. I can't control if 10 instances of this class are created, but I can limit to a single db call instead of 10. 
 Is a shared pointer amongst the class instances a feasible and a solution here? My understanding is that the a shared pointer to the cache will keep it alive as I need, but I'm unsure how to pass a pointer between the instances like this. I'm also wondering if I'm overthinking the problem and there is a simpler solution I'm not considering. I'd appreciate any advice or insight, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I want to write my own NES "cartridge decoder" that will serve as a helper tool during development of my NES emulator. One of it's capabilities will be dissasembly of a PRG ROM. However the thing with these ROMs is that data is mixed up with the code and it can look roughly like this:
 <some data>
 <couple of instructions>
 <some data>
 <couple of instructions> 
 And etc. So if you are looking at compiled binary you really have no way of telling whether given byte is treated as instruction, instruction operand (or part of it) or data used by the program.
 I came up with 2 approaches how I could tackle this:
  
Lazy approach - Just interpret everything as instruction (of course by taking their variable length into account)
 Better approach - Interpret the program, not exactly by executing it but going instruction by instruction, tracking where it jumps or which subroutines it calls. While processing branch instructions process both cases. Read interrupt vectors and interpret them as well until reaching RTS instruction. Everything else would be considered raw data and dead code would also fall into that category. Basically disassembler would go instruction by instruction to determine where code execution can lead to distinguish instructions from the data.
  
I never specifically wrote a dissasembler, so I would like to know if my ideas are at least good, or there are better, more reliable approaches to that out there.

 When I goto interviews now I try to let them know I made some small apps and iPhone games and have a github they can check out. I really am hoping that will put me in the front of the pack.
 I know some people say coding is just a job and you don't NEED to enjoy it but when you have 2 people working together who both find what they do interesting I think it can make the job alot more enjoyable.

Because of the number and type of operations that are required to find, load, and initialize an algorithm provider, the BCryptOpenAlgorithmProvider function is a relatively time intensive function. Because of this, we recommend that you cache any algorithm provider handles that you will use more than once, rather than opening and closing the algorithm providers over and over.
  
This implies to me that you can globally initialize the algorithm handle and reuse it throughout your application in all threads. But since MSDN doesn't say anything about it, I'm not sure whether that's true or if the handle caching guidance applies per thread.
 Can anyone shed some light on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As mentioned in the title, for some reason, every time I re-open Visual Studio Code, I have to delete my project's build folder and clean and rebuild. If I don't, I get a black screen and the game locks up eventually.
 After deleting the build folder, clean and rebuilding, the issue never happens again until I re-open VS Code.
 I'm currently using the latest version of Visual Studio Code alongside the following extensions:
  
CMake by twxs
 CMake Tools by ms-vscode
 CodeLLDB by vadimcn
 C/C++ Intellisense, debugging, and code browsing
  
Btw, OpenAL-Soft was added to my engine project which is a library my game includes.
 I'm running:
  
Latest version of VSCode
 Compiler: Clang 17.0.6
 OS: Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4
 OpenGL 4.2
 Windowing: GLFW
 Also using GLAD.
  
I could just delete and rebuild everything every every morning, but doing this would mean rebuilding my entire project. Has this every happened to you?
 Any tips or recommendations are greatly appreciated.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, fellow Gophers!
 I'm new to Go, transitioning from Python where I extensively used Django and FastAPI to build backends. In the Python world, I was used to riding on the shoulders of giants. Python frameworks usually provide built-in tools for authentication—everything from password validation and encryption to token expiration and third-party logins.
 Now, as I start developing my first API with Go Chi1, I've noticed the prevalent advice is to implement features from scratch. This shift has left me anxious about potential missteps and the risk of creating an insecure application.
 Do you all build auth from scratch when using Go Chi, or are there trusted libraries you rely on? How do you manage the complexity and ensure security? 
 1 Choosing Chi over the many other "expressive, lightweight, API router" was already a tough dilemma (and still I don't know if I chose the right tool). I first started out with Fiber until someone told me "I shouldn't because it doesn't use one of standard lib" though, to be honest, I didn't really understand the reasoning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My boss, the tech lead who at one point was the sole developer on the team, keeps handing over his half-assed / half-completed projects to me. 
 He'll do 30-40% of the work, write zero documentation, and then will tell me to finish it without giving me any context. 
 My boss is the kind of guy who has trouble delegating tasks on a product that's his "baby" and really wants to keep his hands in everything that happens.
 I get that as a senior developer it's my job to work on complicated things, but it takes me twice as long just to understand the code he wrote as actually finishing the project. It also makes me feel like an idiot when I have to ask him a hundred questions about what he's already done + why he made particular choices (which are often not well-thought-out). He also often takes a long time to respond (since he's busy working on 5000 other tasks) leaving me confused and frustrated.
 Better yet, if I end up taking a long time to understand what he's done / finish the solution, he'll get impatient and then will try to finish it himself. 
 This jobs has a lot of perks and I'm generally left alone most of the time (which is great), but I'm getting pretty demoralized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've worked in front-end web dev before, although 95% of my experience is in systems, machine learning, and gamedev as a hobby in c++, java, c#, python etc. I've definitely had an interest in doing web development and I have worked in a small team before to do a simple web app, but I found that the process was absolutely agonizing. 
 ​
 Specifically, javascript seems to take my least favorite aspects of all the languages I know, and puts them together in one singular package seemingly designed from the ground up to make development as frustrating as humanely possible. 
 ​
 I'm learning rust now but I consider myself a beginner still, and even though I don't think I'm quite past the initial growing pains with getting used to it, I am enjoying it and I'm all for trying out literally any alternative in existence to using javascript again. 
 ​
 So as someone who knows nothing about it beyond skimming through the first page of google, do any of you actively use rust for front end? What's the current limitations? I can imagine countless benefits to using it over javascript, but are there any drawbacks to using rust for it over javascript? 
 ​
 I know absolutely nothing about it, and my web dev knowledge overall is extremely rusty and likely outdated. But are you somehow working with frameworks like react but with rust? Or bindings? CSS? Any sort of generalized idea of how it works, what the experience is like and maybe some pointers on good resources for getting started would be really appreciated

I'm trying to understand how the serial port hardware interacts with the system clock. From the documentation I've found online, it seem like the serial port derives its clock from the system clock directly, instead of through the timer DIV, like the audio hardware:
 Cycle-Accurate Game Boy Docs, Section 6
 Does this mean that even when the serial port is not enabled (via SC bit-7) this counter is increasing? What happens when the serial port is enabled? Does the counter reset to 0?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
 repo
 This is a proof of concept/Prototype
 Almost a year ago, I started working on a GDScript compiler. And then stopped because getting GDExtensions to work (even in C) was a pain (because it's not documented). This was my first time using rust, so the code was kinda bad. 
 I have revisited the project, but it's a bit different now. Instead of using LLVM to generate machine code, I generate rust, because if I can use rust I will (even for shaders). 
 And with help of gdext, I won't have to deal with GDExtensions.
 Benchmarks
 The rust version (without optimizations) can run 5 times faster in this case nth Fibonacci number.
  GDScript: 390 ms Rust: 77 ms 
 (Code for the benchmark can be seen in addon/bench.gd)
 Features
  
Function
 Calling functions in the same file
 Math
 for loops
 while loops
 if
 variables
 Addon
 maybe I missed something else
  
Limitations
  
Using other Nodes.
 calling function outside the file
 Can generate wrong rust code
 And a lot more
  
FAQ
 Why rust?
 I like it.
 Will this make normal GDScript obsolete?
 No, GDScript is really nice to debug. And fast to iterate.
 Why is GDScript slow?
 IMO, I think the main problem is loops, it's something that any interpreted language fears.
 Why not make a JIT?
 While it will be better for dynamically typed language like GDScript, but it will be harder to implement. Oh, and JIT's won't work on IOS.
 Why not use rust or c++ direly
 Debug in Godot, run with rust. GDScript is easy to debug for normal people, for compiled languages you need to use lldb or gdb.
 Future
  
beg Godot devs for --script-dump-ast
 Better codegen (this that takes AST and makes rust source code)
 Improve the add-on.
  
I won't be working on this for some time. Writing a parser is only fun the first time, not 2 times + other failed attempts with parser generators. Basically, nothing will be done until --script-dump-ast, and then maybe I will continue.
 Maybe this will revive this issue.

 I had a couple of questions that I had trouble finding answers for on Google and was hoping someone could help me understand.
  
In Linux, GCC compiles my c code into an elf file which can then be loaded into memory when executed. Is there a similar process like this for embedded devices? For example, can GCC generate binaries that are flashed onto embedded devices, or do each embedded device have its own compiler?
 
Since Linux syscalls generally don't exist on embedded devices, what c functions can I use when programming for embedded? I'm assuming that glibc wouldn't be available and printf doesn't exist but do utility header files such as stdint.h still exists?
 
 Thanks

 Here's an example of Python challenges for comparison. That list goes from beginner level to hard, but there's no reason we have to vary the difficulty by that much.

 I was wondering, since MinGW GCC is also available on Linux, can I build the cross-compiler such as host=x86_64-w64-mingw32, build=x86_64-linux-gnu and target=tricore? Basically building a cross-compiler using a cross-compiler..
 I know it sounds silly, but would be really helpful since our CI runs on Linux and I want to automate the process. Sorry if it's not the proper subreddit for such questions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The build stage is taking so long (with a timeout set to 1 hour, often reached…)
 package.json contain a lot of caret and tilde ranges which will lead to inconsistent build stage duration since the command ‘npm install’ will always try to fetch the latest version of a package, and if not found it will download it…
 the use of an npm registry did not fix the issue since the process will be highly dependent on the net bandwith the Gitlab runner .
  
What I have been thinking of so far:
  
Use ‘npm ci’ instead of ‘npm install’ basing on a package-lock.json. This method required the manual update of the npm lock file, or maybe with the help of third-party tools/extensions such as Renovate through the scheduling of an update process
 Configure cache on a separate disk? (Not sure about this approach and how it could help me in this case)
  
I posted here in order to get more insights about the matter.

For those of you working for AAA companies (or even III for that matter), what path(s) did you take to get there? Advice for someone trying to break in?

Also, what does it realistically look like to work for a AAA company? Anyway, not looking for anything specific. Just wanting to hear from other industry professionals.

 After having a very harsh life, an opportunity has finally presented itself and I decided to get my CCNA certification earlier this year (on my first try). However, it is still extremely difficult to get my life back on track. As a matter of fact, months are quietly passing by and nobody has called me about a job interview, not even once.
 Of course, that couldn't stop me from being curious about technology (and networking in particular), so I have moved on and continued with acquiring new skills on my own. My next stop was Kali linux (which I love very deeply) and pretty soon I got obsessed with network penetration.

 At first I was using a unique buffer but I then read that it's better for threads to access separate memory locations so i made 3 different buffers, one for each thread, Here's my code and a little explanation. Feel free to destroy me if I misunderstood something, I'm trying to learn so every tip is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I joined this large global company in 2016. It was pretty good back then. Autonomous teams with great developers building great products. My country was very profitable. 
 2018 it is decided that most development work in my country would be moved to India. Our senior developers would now work as architects, product owners and team leads. Most of our great developers decided to jump the ship. I decided to stick around.
 2018-2020 is a disaster. Everything falls apart. Its so bad that there is a new decision to switch back to 100% inhouse development.
 2021, its hard to recruit great developers and we need to recruit a lot of people. Management and HR is not happy with the progress, too many candidates fail the technical interviews, its taking too long to sign new employees. It is decided that there will be no technical interviews from now on, HR will handle 100% of the recruitment process. Focus on "soft values and skills".
 2022, it is still a disaster. We have signed a lot of new emoloyees, most with wrong skillsets due to HR having no clue about what we need. We needed senior software developers and we got database admins, sysadmins, service desk agents etc that wanted to get into software development. 
 2024, we are still in a very bad state, and guess what? The solution is to move development to India again. The history repeats. 
 I should obviously jump the ship, i used to be a developer, now i just spend my time in crisis meetings, escalations, red alerts, meetings with management etc. However i find this mess to be very entertaining. I always enjoy going to work to find out what madness is going on today. Its like a great tv show, i cant wait for the next episode.
 Has anyone been in a similar situation? Enjoying a terrible place to work at? What did you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I'm a relative beginner to C, my goal is to write a web server on Linux myself without looking it up, or without looking up examples online at least, I feel like I would just end up copying it and I want to go about it properly. I think it would massively boost my coding skills as well as help me understand web servers better. 
 I'm curious what your process is for doing this, or what process do you recommend? As far as I understand, the main way to "look up how to use something" like sockets is to use man pages, and do you just reference those and keep looking at whatever you don't understand for the next thing and next thing to etc.? I feel like I have about 50 terminal tabs open because I'm down the rabbit hole of reading man pages, not complaining because I've found out some super interesting stuff, it just doesn't feel super efficient. 
 Let me know if that's just what we do or if you have some other method, I get there's obviously books as well. I'm a bit sick of tutorials and learn how to code sites, especially when I know the basics reasonably well and just want to get onto building something. 
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm on the hunt for a linear algebra library that implements the upcoming std::linalg standard from C++26 (details here). Given that the standard will likely not be widely supported by compilers until around 2030, I'm interested in using a library that aligns with std::linalg now. This would allow for a seamless transition to std::linalg once it becomes broadly available. 
 So far, I haven’t found a library that meets these criteria. I did come across this post, but it wasn’t quite what I needed. If anyone knows of a library that fits this description, I would really appreciate your recommendations.
 Additionally, if anyone is aware of a wrapper for any established libraries like Eigen, Armadillo, BLAS, LAPACK, xtensor, or Blaze that adapts their functionality to align with the proposed std::linalg standard in C++26, I’d be very interested in learning about it. Such a wrapper would ideally allow for easier migration to std::linalg when it becomes standard. Please share any leads or resources you might have.
 Thanks in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been interviewing quite a few people recently for a remote role and noticed most don't bother turning on their camera. It's a bit awkward but I decided to keep mine on anyway.
 Is this very common in your experience?
 I assume they might do it for bias reasons (definitely had women not wanting to get judged because of their appearance and I get that from what I've seen in our field) or just don't feel like it. I didn't push for it as I generally tend to have my team decide by themselves if they turn their camera on during meetings and glad to do as much as possible in Slack. But for a first time meeting people I still find it super hard to... bond with them and then later tell them apart. Or even hire someone without ever having seen their face once.
 Last time I interviewed people for my team a few years ago I didn't notice this, most just seemed to turn on the cam without having it explicitly stated.
 EDIT: 
 For the next rounds I'll definitely see that I explicitly state "video call". I was just surprised people don't do this by default but perhaps I'm just becoming boomer :). But there's a "give a talk and we discuss" round anyway, so I hope at least there they'll turn their cam on.
 I should probably add, this is for a very senior/scientific role, so we also have to meet customers at least virtually, pitch projects, give talks, hold webinars, perhaps go to a conference etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 I’m relatively new to C++ and have a project im working on. The basis of the project is a basketball game where randomized players and their stats are generated through a draft system then stored into multiple text files. 
 I have correlated the players and their attributes using array positions. I have the system set up correctly where I can write the data to the text file and read from it but I am unable to run the code unless I manually go and delete the info from the text file. Only when I do this do the errors disappear.
 It defeats the point if the players stats are not able to be retrieved the first time they were drafted in the game, as I want to be able to implement a save feature where you can pick up where you left off. I have implemented this by creating a main menu, with a switch function, allowing a player to either reset their data by truncating the text files, and undergo the draft process all over again, or continue with the information already in the text file. The issue is however, as I said before, I cannot run this without deleting the data in the file, which I do not want the player to have to do unless they want to reset the game.
 The errors themselves are 2 C2059 errors and Expected a Declaration in the text file themself, which confused me.

nb-crdt: (Typescript) CRDT data structure and interfaces for interacting with it
 nb-editor: (Typescript + React) editor for nb-crdt (it can be used for other data structures)
 nb-crdt-go: (Go)
 nbfm: (Go + Wails + nb-editor) alpha version file manager
  
I built nbfm to demonstrate a serverless collaborative notion-level note editor only using shared files. All the work is done alone, so the quality may not be perfect and may not be that great.
 But it holds the potential to become an all-in-one workspace where users have full data sovereignty. I strongly believe it is valuable in the era of A.I.

 This seems so odd, even entry roles I was flat out denied, let alone the higher up ones. 
 Now I'm not mad cause I already have a role, but is the market this bad? have we hit the point where CS is beyond oversaturated? my only worry is the big salaries are only going to diminish as people get more and more desperate taking less money just to have anything. 
 This really sucks, and worries me.
 Edit: Guys this was not some peer reviewed research experiment, just a quick test. A few things.
  
I am a U.S. Citizen
 I did only apply for work from home jobs which are ultra competitive and would skew the data. 
  
This was more of a discussion to see what the community had to say, nothing more.

 I've worked in two different codebases so far, and like many other C++ devs I find myself frustrated and almost a little insecure inside about how little I know about these features. I'm aware of their existence and "what they do, kinda, sorta...", but I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title. God this is driving me insane. We have an application, FooCRUD, that has an extensive bootrunning process that takes ~15 mins. I'm trying to debug some changes that I'm making, which involve interplay between the frontend and backend. I keep on waiting those 15 minutes and then seeing, okay, this issue still isn't fixed, or now FooCRUD is failing because I imported FooVisual version 4.6.1 instead of 4.6.0, or I forgot a ")" somewhere, and now I have to bootrun again. This story is running way over the allotted hours and I am super embarrassed right now.
 Is "we should make our applications easier to ****ing test" a thing you can agitate for? Obviously actually doing that is going to take a lot of developer time, which a team lead may not be able to justify to stakeholders. Is it a design principle that good devs care about, and if so does it have a name and is there any literature on this?
 Maybe this is a junior-level question and I should've figured out a generalizable approach years ago. Idk I just wanted to vent. I've dealt with similar things before with e.g. debugging SQL stored procedures or big data pipelines. 5 YOE mid here

I was going to start using it but didn’t know if it would be good to use, only for the fact it seems to be beginner level which is good, but doesn’t give you an idea what to do after to keep growing your skills and knowledge. I’ve heard learncpp is good so should I just do that? Any advice is welcomed. Thank you.

 I was wondering if anyone might be able to share some insight into what went wrong with my latest release? It's been a week so far and the sales are not ideal to say the least. I'm genuinely interested in learning from this since I'm at a loss.
 I tried to make a unique, fun, challenging, and non-linear detective game and was really excited about it. Essentially the more you play, the more the story comes through and the pieces fit together.
 Here are some highlights of everything I've done leading up to release:
  
3 years of effort with 2 years of full time dev working on this game. Invested $1k into hiring proper voice actors.
 2 years ago participated in a Steam Next Fest to gather wishlists.

 In TS, I can return union types where it can be either `this` or `that`:

 In this trivial example, I can return a false OR a string.
 How can I achieve the same thing in C++? It's okay if the whole pattern needs to be different, but I want to be able to return different types from a function... if possible.

If you ever had to cross-compile some C the traditional way, you know how painful it is. With zig cc it's literally just a single flag away, -target $TRIPLE. That's it. With QEMU user mode and WINE I can easily test my code for Windows and obscurer architectures all within a few minutes in a single terminal session. I don't need to wonder whether my code works on 32-bit big-endian PowerPC or on i386 Windows because I can just check. It just feels like a better frontend to clang, imo.
 (Plus, zig cc also has nicer defaults, like a more debugger-friendly UBSan being enabled by default)

 First company was bigtech. I kinda just cruised. I would ask for work, and literally my manager would be like *shrug. I never got any projects... never got any tasks... I literally did nothing for 2.5 years but simple bash scripts here and there.
 So I quit and joined another company. I got a bit more work here, more projects, etc. I was able to get a team of 2 junior engineers, we worked on projects here and there
 I didn't "grow" because I was always the most senior.... I had nobody to get guidance or advice from.
 Whenever we built new projects, I basically "architected" it and built it with the team... but... it was 99.9% me teaching them stuff. I never really learned much I feel.
 Even simple basic things like... code standards, I just did what I felt like was the best. For our software design patterns, I used GoF stuff I learned from reading, where it SEEMED like it would be good, but I had no guidance or feedback! I architected a distributed system when we finally got a bigger project and while it worked and scaled, I have no idea if I did it "right"...
 Now that I'm laid off, and looking for a new job... I feel like a serious imposter during my interviews. A) I "architected" and "standardized code on the team" but... it was a team 3 and it feels like bullshit and I don't really know anything. and B) When I get asked about design patterns... sure I "know" the patterns but... I have about as much experience APPLYING them as a newgrad....
 I feel like my 7 YOE knowledge is LESS than a 2YOE who worked on a big team with a senior engineer advising them

 I'm currently working on implementing Conway's Game of Life in the terminal using C++, and I've encountered a challenge that has me stumped.
 As I dive into building the two-dimensional grid required for the game, I'm faced with a dilemma: should I use a 2-D array or vectors? My goal is to create a grid that can dynamically change its size during runtime, which rules out arrays due to their fixed size. After some research, I've learned that vectors in C++ offer the flexibility I need, allowing me to resize them on the fly.
 Despite dedicating hours to this endeavor, I'm finding the process of dynamically resizing the grid using vectors to be quite daunting. Specifically, I'm struggling to increase the size of the grid by (rows+2) x (columns+2) when certain conditions are met.
 If there's anyone proficient in C++ who has experience with dynamic resizing of 2-D vectors, I would greatly appreciate any guidance, tips, or code snippets you could share to help me overcome this obstacle. Your assistance would be invaluable in bringing my Game of Life project to life!
 Thank you all in advance for your support and expertise.
 Thank YOU!

 Poll: loops over a list of provided fds, calling a is_ready() fn and updating another list with the fds which is_ready() call returns true
 Epoll: registers all provided fds into a epoll fd, which on new events will wake up epoll_wait(), tho i dont know how does the event triggering works? i read on some high level explanation that its a dedicated thread that loops over the fds, so equiv to poll but it wouldnt make sense - then on new event, a list of ready fds is returned and the wait update its structure with the ready fds, user then just have to iterate over this list of ready fds
 i dont know if its clear, i hope so.
 man epoll() says this: 
 By contrast, when used as a level-triggered interface (the
 default, when EPOLLET is not specified), epoll is simply a faster
 , and can be used wherever the latter is used since it
 shares the same semantics.poll(2)
 I would like to know if my understanding of how poll detects ready fd is good, and how does epoll listen / triggers on new events, as well as why is level triggered epoll is faster than poll even if it seems to me that on level triggered mode epoll does the same as poll (iterates over fds and check if ready)
 thanks in advance for the help

I am currently on chapter 15 on the book, and I think I have a good understanding of the stuff I read up to that point. However, when I try to program anything real, I get very overwhelmed and can't seem to figure things out. I feel as if the libraries I see are either too abstracted to teach me anything about Rust itself, and I have to learn about the library. Or, things are complicated and I see crazy patterns that take me a long time to figure out. What projects can I write to teach me fundamentals?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have this senior dev join us last year. Soon after they joined we learned that they overengineer and overcomplicate absolutely everything. They pushes back on every feedback they gets in the PRs with very very long responses, links to resources, etc. 
 We decided to let them work on a new initiative, so they could take their time to understand our process since there wasn’t a hard deadline on it. The project has become a deviant and a one-off where they didn’t follow any of the patterns we used on any of the other services. Basically you tell them, we need to do C and to get there we need to build A and B. He then goes and builds E, F, G, H and then finally C. You tell him that that’s not how we usually do things, and then they asks you to write the requirements for it, and they will make sure that C matches those requirements… I don’t think anyone else on the team would be able to contribute to this project or support it, which is almost like a legacy service being brand new.
 They don’t get involved in any of the other tasks the rest of the team does, but constantly requires time from everyone to review their PRs. They also started getting very involved with other teams organizing lunch and learns, presentations, discussions and trying to get buy-in from other teams in how they do things.
 This individual is a very smart person and I don’t doubt his technical skills.. but is really a pain to work with him. He seem to be very obsessed with the processes shared with other teams instead of anything related to us. I don’t know if he is trying to set himself up for a promotion or what, but it is becoming exhausting

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So recently I decided I was going to replace my LinkedIn profile pic since my current one is outdated. While I hadn't yet replaced it I left it blank and suddenly received 2 unsolicited messages from recruiters and 2 responses from other job listings in the span of 1 week. For context, I had spent 6 months and ~800 job apps which I know isn't that many but I haven't even gotten a phone screen. My last and only interview was 6 months ago, where I made it to the final round and was rejected because they had an applicant with more experience than me (I had over 2 YOE and it was a junior role FML). 
 Anyway I'm starting to question the timing of these recruiter messages. I don't think there was anything wrong with my profile picture. The only critique I could think of is that it was a bit outdated so I might have looked too young. I don't really want this to turn into a r/RoastMe post so just bear with me and assume I am just an average looking person. 
 I think the more likely scenario is that there is some algorithm that LinkedIn uses that detects when users become less engaged on the platform and then decides to rapidly promote that user into reengaging again. This may come across as tinfoil hatty but I do think this is the most likely outcome since the timing does not make any sense and I haven't read anything to suggest the job market suddenly improved a ton. I am curious if other people have had similar things happen to them like this.
 Also an FYI I am a White Male U.S. Citizen with 2.5 YOE in a popular tech stack in a west coast city.

Trying to find the balance of just enough documentation without over documenting things when i know it may not be really referenced. 
 What is your take on internal documentation for your team - at least when it comes to reference things. Do you also have documentation which is used to help developers whenever they get stuck an issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes I see the following scenario:
 Playtester: The movement feels very stiff.
 Dev: Oh yeah that's intentional because this game was inspired by Resident Evil 1.
 Your playtester is giving you honest feedback. The best thing to do is take notes. You know who isn't going to care about the "design" excuse? The person who leaves a negative review on Steam complaining about the same issues. The best outcome is that your playtester comes to that conclusion themselves.
 Playtester: "The movement feels very stiff, but those restrictions make the moment-to-moment gameplay more intense. Kind of reminds me of Resident Evil 1, actually."
 That's not to say you should take every piece of feedback to heart. Absolutely not. If you truly believe clunky movement is part of the experience and you can't do without it, then you'll just have to accept that the game's not for everyone.
 The best feedback is given when you don't tell your playtester what to think or feel about what they're playing. Just let them experience the game how a regular player would.

create interface for your struct (already really damn tedious)
 refactor code so that the mocked struct is now passed into your unit either through argument or through parent struct (this can be miserable)
 find the previous mockgen command, append the new mock to it, run (surely there is a better way)
  
Also is there no way to mock a function that is not a method? Or what if a function call is hardcoded into the unit you are trying to test. What would you do then?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I'm working with an STM32G070CB microcontroller and facing an issue where the USART2 interrupt isn't being triggered after populating the TDR with the first byte. Despite configuring the USART with FIFO enabled and setting up the correct NVIC priorities, the data isn't being transmitted, and the ISR isn't called. I've checked the usual suspects like global interrupts, USART initialization, and error flags, but the problem persists. Here's a brief overview of my setup: FIFO is enabled for USART2. NVIC is configured with the correct priority for USART2 interrupts. Global interrupts are enabled. USART2 is initialized with the correct settings (baud rate, word length, etc.). Hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) is enabled.

Hopefully it might be useful to others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assuming we have a vulnerable c program and we found a buffer overflow vulnerability on the program and created an exploit on that. Can the same exploit be executed if the vulnerable c program runs on a different machine? Will memory addresses be the same?
 I think the answer is no they probably won´t even be the same when running only in the same environment and on the same machine. There is nothing like a guarantee that it will have the same address.
 A modern-day OS assigns the memory arbitrarily (within certain sections of course). This technique is called Address Space Layout Randomization. Also gcc or clang uses the --fstack-protector that prevents buffer overflow attacks
 Hence, my final question confuses me and make no sense for me based on this video is how geohot manage to exploit a buffer overflow attack remotely if addresses would not the same. He first did it locally and then remotely. How does he manage to achieve it?

 If I assign a string value to a regular pointer, no segfault takes place. So why does it happen when I do it with a double pointer?

Anyways we had a big company wide meeting the same day and someone asked if there would be more layoffs and the guy basically said "I definitely can't promise there won't be but I can say for the life of the company wether that's 5, 10, 20, 100 years from now we will have many many more". 
 I also learned from some of my coworkers who have been here for 3 years that they've had layoffs every year. 
 The layoffs were not due to performance. They are always simply operational cost things aka your team is costing more than value so bye. 
 Idk it's just so icky. I feel like I need to really work hard to avoid getting laid off. Like my job is always at risk and any day I might wake up and oh I got laid off lol. I get business is business but it's just really fucking icky. 
 I really liked this job but now I'm just icked tf out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been working about 10 years at larger tech companies and joined my first startup (a late stage one) several months ago as a Staff dev.
 When I was interviewing they had told me that I would receive X # of options at some strike price and so I negotiated heavily for more options in my package. Little did I know, they were about to announce a funding round, invalidating the previous strike price and the strike price that I would receive has tripled (which I have not yet been granted). Sure I still get X # options however they are now at 3x the strike price. This means that instead of paying say $200k to exercise my options I have to pay $600k if I ever want to exercise (with the risk that it becomes potentially be worthless if it never IPOs).
 Given that I don't see the company realistically going IPO until at least 5+ years, this means if I leave before then I will have to either shell out a large amount of money or just leave my stake on the table. If I just leave it on the table then it only makes financial sense for me to stay at the company the amount of time equal to the amount of options I am willing to exercise.
 Has anyone else joined in the middle of a raise unknowingly and are there other solutions? Has anyone tried to renegotiate their offer package after joining since grants haven't been issued?

 What's your golden rule for generating a custom word list for a target? Whether it's an individual or organization. I.e first.last<year> first.last<season><year> etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I write a small tool to print process memory usages, memory mappings and real-time process network connections. Those information could be important when debugging OOM situation because it is hard to collect those data once the process is killed. Users can use this to collect process information on a suspicious OOM process and once the process is killed then users can use the data that memdoor collected to debug what's going on.

 I'm running latest kali linux on a legion 7, vmbox. Im using a Brostrend A1 network adapter.
 I've put it into monitor mode successfully with 'airmon-ng check kill' + 'airmon-ng start wlan0'. I can run 'airodump-ng wlan0' (my adapter doesn't change to wlan0mon, for some reason, despite an iwconfig showing it in monitor mode). I'm able to catch all kinds of aps and clients, bssid's. 
 Okay so I captured my target bssid, I then ran airodump again to find my target clients. I'm pretty sure my phone is hiding it's Mac address, because it doesn't show up under 2.4 or 5ghz packet capture. But despite that I'm sitting with my whole family and no ones showing as being kicked off when I run aireplay-ng. When I run this I've tried deauth against just the full AP, but I've also tried several device Mac addresses that are showing up. It actually runs the deauth successfully. I'm seeing ack results. But yeah despite trying maybe 5 or 6 times on different networks and devices. It'll run, but it won't kick anyone off. 
 Any ideas? I can post some blurred out shots

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies upfront for the long post. I'm going through some existential crisis and just felt like writing it out.
 I've been a developer for around 14-15 years and have worked on a lot of different tech and systems and have a good breadth of knowledge i'd say. 
 But i've never really worked on anything with huge amounts of data or low latency requirements or extremely high throughout etc. Have always worked in big orgs and on systems with moderate non-functional specs and lots of business features. Historically i've not been into developer communities or open source contributions (earlier in career due to lack of awareness and now due all sorts of stuff including lack of motivation to do this outside work hours). I'm trying to change this a bit recently by getting more involved in communities in my company.
 Having said that within my teams i've always got good remarks, hikes and considered as a solid all-round senior. Pay was always good and I mostly enjoyed my work (was almost too grateful to even be hired as a SWE at the start). I also keep myself quite updated even though most of that knowledge stays mostly theoretical.
 As I evaluate my career i wonder if I should have seeked out more challenging work? There seems to be an expectation that after all these years one would have atleast tackled some hard technical challenge and I cant seem to think of any. Slowly starting to feel if i'm actually good to even handle anything challenging now and that's not helping my confidence to even look for such opportunities. What if I get an opportunity and fail?
 Just wondering if others have gone through such a phase and found their peace somehow? Or any advice on how to position myself for the next 15 years of my career?

I heard about your game from a friend and it seems perfect!" and then link to a twitch profile that has been inactive for two years.
 I know that these are likely bots/scammers looking for free steam keys to resell. My game is 2 bucks though...

 The market is bad and it's hard to get a job. But this isn't unique to tech. A majority of skilled jobs are hard to get right now besides traditionally stable fields like medicine or accounting. Go into any other career reddit and it's the same issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use React.js for building web UIs, It's OK but i would much rather write Go. I tend to dislike programming with js, especially with large projects for a variety of reasons, like slow lsp, large imports section, lot's of dependencies, lack of useful primitives, bad error handeling.
 React.js makes it easy to manipulate the page however you want, also it has a lot of component libraries that handle stuff like animations and certain behaviors. 
 I heard there is htmx but apparently, it's supposed to be an ajax library, i don't mind doing fetches and writing javascript for that (much prefer it actually since there is a ton of stuff i would do when i ajax in case of errors, retries, signal abortion...). The javascript i hate writing is usually the dom manipulation javascript that you use to do something in the page. Is there something that handles this stuff that works with Go?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, i'm currently having some issue with Rust, where after each change I make rust recompiles all dependencies. I've found some post on this topic on stackoverflow, but unfortunately the solutions didn't helped in my case or maybe I misunderstood something while trying them out, so I came here to post my issue.
 use bevy::prelude::*; fn main() { App::new() .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins) .add_systems(Update, file_drag_and_drop_system) .run(); } fn file_drag_and_drop_system(mut events: EventReader<FileDragAndDrop>) { for event in events.read() { info!("{:? }", event); } } 
 I simply add an addition space after the ? character in the file_drag_and_drop_system function. Then press ctrl + s to save the change and after that use cargo run / cargo build. In both cases cargo recompiles all dependencies.
 The things I've tried so far:
  
Some people suggested, that the problem is that the build incremental isn't set to true.
 Others said, that setting the CARGO_TARGET_DIR environmental variable to a different folder might solve the problem.
  
config.toml in .cargo folder
 Prior to my issue I also set up the cargo.toml file after the Bevy getting started guide.
 [package] name = "bevy_01" version = "0.1.0" edition = "2021" [workspace] resolver = "2" # Important! wgpu/Bevy needs this! # NOTE: Remember to remove "dynamic_linking" before releasing your game! # Otherwise you will need to include libbevy_dylib alongside your game if you want it to run. # If you remove the "dynamic" feature, your game executable can run standalone. [dependencies] bevy = { version = '0.13', features = ["dynamic_linking"] } # Enable a small amount of optimization in debug mode [profile.dev] opt-level = 1 # Enable high optimizations for dependencies (incl. Bevy), but not for our code: [profile.dev.package."*"] opt-level = 3 
 I'm using VSCode with Rust Analyzer on Windows 10, Rust version v1.79.0-nightly
 Thanks in advance for any help

 QEMU with command-line is quite verbose and tedious and I found the wrapper of HCL via Packer a bit more configuration friendly.
 If there is no fork, what are other tools being used to create such VM images in the OSS world?

Yeah, i would recommend not launching a steam page if you are intent on looking for a publisher, as the steam page launch is generally a pretty big marketing beat that they'd want some control over.
  
We've been working on a game that we intend to get a publisher for. Our plan was to launch a steam page soon because I heard somewhere way in the past that before you even pitch to publishers, you must provide proof that people are interested in your game. I've read that some even had to have successful Kickstarter campaigns before big publishers took them seriously.
 So I'd like to ask people here who have experienced having their game picked up by publishers, is that really the case?

Any websites, tutorials, or online courses you highly recommend for learning about x86 architecture, ARM architecture, and the translation process itself would be fantastic!
 
Articles or white papers that provide a clear explanation of the different translation techniques (emulation vs static translation) would be super helpful.
 
If there are any must-read books on this topic, please point me in the right direction! I'm open to both beginner-friendly introductions and more advanced texts for when I get comfortable with the basics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe a better thing to ask would be: how do you ensure you’re recognized for the products of your work?
 I’ve had a strange problem for a while now: despite putting in the same hours as my coworkers, and being very productive in terms of tickets, I have for years now been receiving the feedback that I should work with more urgency, and should try to get things done faster. I genuinely do not slack off at all, but the fact that I keep receiving this feedback (and that it has followed me between companies) indicates to me that I’m clearly at least doing a poor job of representing myself.
 For example: once, after a particularly rough sprint a manager had a version of this conversation with me, and we pulled up metrics, and over the course of that sprint I’d completed more tickets than anyone else on the team, and had completed the same number of “urgent” tickets as the rest of the team combined. (And it’s not as though I just pick easy tickets to pump my numbers)
 In one-off situations like that it’s easy to be like, look, I’m sorry I’m giving off this appearance, but if we look at the actual work that got done I think it’s clear I’m pulling my weight… but it’s really not a conversation I enjoy having over and over. Instead I’d really like to just not give off that appearance in the first place.

It feels like it is dependent on the type of game you are making i.e. multiplayer, single player, coop, open world, shooter, rpg, action adventure, survival horror, etc.
 But I certainly could be wrong. Maybe there is a best/universal/one size fits all answer here. Is there a gold standard of game design knowledge that I am missing here?

 1.hired in at too high a role. There was one right below the position I was hired in that I didn't even know existed until a few years later which would have been more appropriate, but I made it through.
 2. This one is the most awkward but basically I had a manager who had a terrible rep for not promoting/supporting his female subordinates (which is someone else I didn't find out until much later and after the guy got laid off)
 3. Covid was weird for my company so no a lot of promotions going on for that first year or so.
 4. My spouse died very suddenly 2 years ago and I discovered him (hard story, sorry) and, as you can imagine, that first year or so after I wasn't super focused on career development. 
 So now I'm living in a different place and am thinking about switching up roles at a new company but I don't really know how to plan out my resume. I know the market is hard enough as it is right now so I need all the advice I can get. Thanks all!

I explained to him that we didn't have requirements for that and because of differences in the implementation, they wouldn't really work for this customer.
 On Friday he emailed the customer and asked them if they were planning on flowing us new requirements for the features that we discussed because it would make the tool much better. He didn't copy me, but the customer emailed back, copying me, and said they were considering it. I replied that we could discuss it, but gave the reasons why it wouldn't be a good idea for them.
 They also copied our management and our director came and yelled at me for "requirements fishing" - someone at the customer felt we were trying to increase the scope to inflate the contract value. To be honest, my reply wasn't the best (I didn't think it through enough and I can see why they might have thought we were coordinating)
 I'm pissed, if I were management, I'd fire him. To top it off, I think he realized that it's coming back on him, he disappeared and I couldn't find him Friday afternoon. I've got to do damage control with management on Monday - how would you handle this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was doing some market research for my next game and came upon those two games:
  
Vojo: price: 0.99$, released in march 2022, currently has 237 reviews.
 
SIZIF: price: 0.99$, released in july 2023, currently has 13 reviews.
 
 Both games are endless runners with a minimalistic style, they have the same features, are both the dev’s first game, have good reviews, and have very little coverage on youtube and other social medias.
 So why do you think one has almost 20 times more reviews than the other? I am genuinely curious because it doesn’t really make any sense to me…

Didn't see a good example on how to use the public key passed from the ssh server into the bubbletea app so I made one myself. General idea is to use one's public key over ssh as a user identifier and then assign user roles to gate off content. 
 You can check the repo out here: https://gitlab.com/rdubwiley/texty
 Hope it's useful if someone wants ideas on how to expose their TUI to the web or if someone is thinking of different ways to need user authentication for their ssh app.

The player deliberately makes incorrect choices to entice you to play the game, but the ad is fake and the game is a pay-to-play base-building a la Clash of Clans.
 So what are those ads? If I were to guess, they are games thrown together in 15 minutes in a game engine like Unity just to make the ad. Would I be correct?

 I remember seeing posts on this sub not too long ago about people complaining that they had too little work to do while making 250k TC and working remotely from their fishing boat. Now, the posts have transitioned from the market being terrible to FAANG offshoring/outsourcing jobs, DEI/race wars, and class action lawsuits against bootcamps.
 Man, this place is really something else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My girlfriend (a non-programmer) recently asked me what it means when programmers say that "everything is just binary under the hood". I started telling her how files don't intrinsically "mean" something and that programs simply do something with the bytes.
 For instance, an image utility assumes that if there is a file.png somewhere and its internal binary layout follows the PNG conventions then it must be an image and it will display that image on screen interpreting the bytes as RGBA values. However, other programs may interpret these same bytes differently and do other things with them.
 To demo that concept in the most obvious way, I created snapsound - a CLI (for now) that allows you to transform any MP3 file into a PNG image but retain the ability to play back the original sound. It's as simple as
 snapsound snap song.mp3 # Creates song.png snapsound play song.png 
 If you're curious, the code is completely open source on GitHub. It can be easily installed with go intall.
 As a summation of this little research effort, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it is to write a program that plays sound in Go! The only thing is, I think that github.com/gopxl/beep (one of the deps) requires CGo to build on Linux, but MacOS and Windows are pure Go, no need for anything else (already tested both).

How do you guys usually imagine your code structure beforehand in detail and cleanly. cuz im noticing that I have the same issue at work my philosophy is to think about the task good enough then start implementing as fast as possible so that if I fail, I fail fast and have time to recover, because in my mind there are stuff I wont be able to predict no matter how long I think about it, but my issue is that the amount of things that I cant predict is a lot more than what other developers cant predict, one of those things is overall structure for example (as simple as it may be :) ), so how do you guys approach this sort of tasks, and if you have any advice on how to improve it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been living in a VHCOL city on the west coast for the past few years, working as a software engineer. My company has an office out here, but announced recently they're closing it at the end of the month, after which I'll be fully remote.
 I don't particularly care for the city I live in, and thought that remote work would be a great opportunity to move to a larger city with more energy, namely NYC. I've been floating this idea around my team since the announcement of the closure was made, and haven't gotten any negative feedback around it, so I felt pretty confident about the topic when I officially asked my boss if I could move to NYC after I become fully remote.
 He got back to me a few days later (after speaking with HR), and said that a move is totally doable, if I take a $50k pay cut in my TC. I was pretty floored at this request, especially since by any metric NYC is more expensive than where I currently live, but the rationale is that the pay bands in NYC are ostensibly lower for my job compared to my current city.
 I'm wondering, is this level of pay cut common for a move from the west coast to NYC? It seems totally unreasonable to me, especially after looking at jobs at some of the other tech companies operating out of NYC. Many of these companies actually explicitly state that their pay bands are identical for NYC and the city I live in currently. Does anyone has experience with this kind of move?

For example, 8 hours of coding in one day is half as productive as 4 hours one day and another 4 hours the next. So I try to spend half a day coding and half a day writing, networking, and applying to jobs. Sometimes reading fits into this but for material that's particularly challenging or math heavy I may dedicate a coding day to that material.
 What makes this tricky is some days my brain works better than others, and it's not entirely predictable. I coded for 12 hours straight on Thursday because I noticed I was having a "good brain day," but Friday passed and it's now Saturday and I barely have enough brain juice to write this reddit post.
 I'm curious if other people plan their work around things like this and what tips/tricks they may have!

 When i try to get into writing my own structs and enums, the moment that the data access isn't trivial (like immutable linked list over a generic type) i hit a wall with the many smart pointer types and which one to use (and when to just use the & reference), and how to think of lifetimes when i write it. Moreover, the compiler errors and suggestions tend to be cyclic and not lead to fixing the code.
 If anyone has some tips on how to approach annotating lifetimes and in general resources on lifetimes and references for beginners i would very much appreciate sharing them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a seasoned engineer with experience with more than one language and lately I am learning go. I am all in.
 One thing I am still getting used to is how the file system API is designed, I might get used to it with time, but for the moment it feels a bit sparse.
 You have os for most things, filepath surprisingly has a Glob function, then a bunch of things implementing io.Reader and io.Writer and so on.
 I tried very hard for weeks to not write to disk in my tests, but it sounds borderline an antipattern at this point. I would have to create a specific struct with all my functionality and a mock for it.
 What I am used to, and thought was a good design, was to have all fs methods to take a fs instance and given that go does do that for few things I was confused when I don't see that as just "the way to do it".
 Also, os.DirFS is admittedly broken for things that require dynamic paths or cross os compat, which makes it hard to use things like MapFS in your tests (MapFS looks so good on paper).
 Is there something I need to learn about this to get more comfortable or did I get to the same conclusion as everyone else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve increasingly seen companies say they won’t hire junior developers because they waste time and money training them for them to just leave.
 There’s something really sick to me on a fundamental level about the idea of people leaving a job after a few years to go from $160k to $180k. It’s hard for me to personally justify being a part of such a huge class divide. 
 Edit: guys I’m not saying juniors are getting paid that. That’s an example of my friend who sent from senior to staff. It’s just an example of “person getting paid 6 figures leaves job to get paid slightly more 6 figures” and how casual it is would be unfathomable to most Americans, and you’re all showing how out of touch you are by ignoring the point and focusing on the numbers lmao.
 I’m not blaming anyone who jumps jobs (I wish we could hop jobs all the time it’s our right as workers) I’m just curious to have a discussion if anyone else feels the same. But I’m already exhausted of Reddit after 10 comments lmao. It is impossible to have a good faith discussion on the internet 😂😂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw this company's website, where they claim to provide "a specialized high-performance managed-cloud" with 100% SLA. They have a cloud hosting SLA page, where they state that customers are not eligible for compensation in circumstances beyond their reasonable control. Those are:
  
scheduled maintenance, emergency maintenance, upgrades
 force majeure events, interrupts/delays in telecommunications or third party services
 targeted attacks
 ...
  
I don't fully grasp the concept of SLA yet, but it feels that they just excluded all the possible conditions for downtime, to be able to claim 100% uptime. It looks even worse because they look like "resellers", in the sense that they are offering you a managed experience of somebody else's cloud (companies can do that?), and then they exclude third party interrupts/delays. 
 What do you think of this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I switched my primary language from C/C++ to rust around 5 years back. I have been interviewing lately for a job change. Most of the interviews were 45 min affairs, solving Leetcode style problems (why ?? - that is a separate discussion).
 Sadly, I have come to realize rust is not ideal for this scenario, and going to switch back to C for these coding rounds. Most of these interviews involved working with 2D arrays, linked list, binary trees and such which would be relatively simple in C/C++.
 More context: I have had to spend a good part of the 45 min setting up these primitives, before even trying to solve the core algorithmic challenge. Few reasons:
  
Things like coderpad don't let you use external crates (e.g) there is one for 2D arrays
 Some questions involve removing elements from middle of lists in O(1) time. I had to hand roll a doubly linked list with unsafe pointer usage to achieve that, which itself easily filled the time
  
With C/C++, these interviews used to go lot better, uh. Now I think: use C/C++ for interviews, rust for product development. Any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I heard this metaphor a long time ago. I forget where and from whom. I also forget exactly how it went, but the basic idea was this. Developers are going to want to build their sandcastles. And the idea I think it was trying to express was the desire of software developerss to build the most complete, robust, and elegant solutions they could engineer for the problems they are trying to solve.
 Sometimes this may be good, but the context I think I remember the metaphor in was that of, "project managers are necessary otherwise develops will never make progress towards a end goal, with endless scope creep and analysis paralysis". Thinking about it now, I think this metaphor was being used in reference to the video game industry when I heard it.
 This post is two part, firstly, and mostly for my curiosity, I was hoping you all who are familiar with this expression could remind me exactly how it goes and provide your take on it.
 Secondly, I would like to start a discussion on the topic. At work, I don't really seem to face this issue that often. But when working on a personal project, I seem to almost never get very far because I get stuck in this trance where I am trying to over engineer the first problems I come across with any amount of complexity. For example, I have tried writing a vulkan renderer multiple times now, and each time I get stuck on trying to build a thesis on device and queue selection, coding for every use case that I can imagine, when in reality I only need one or two simple methods for accomplishing this task. So, have any of you also ever struggled with this, and what are some good ways to work around this?

 i just had an interview with a startup and I was told im not what they're looking for. at what point do you become what they're fucking looking for? what was the point of my degree? 
 what do I do? do I just keep applying to this stupid rat race and hope something sticks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently working as a strat for a large bank, we predominantly code in c++ and python. I have somehow ended up managing a team of 10 persons, mostly vps and some associates. I am director myself and now barely code, although need to debug regularly to help the team when they are blocked.
 Thing is I was a bit naive and thought I had to climb the corporate ladder to increase comp, but I have now realised I would be much happier as an IC. I can now see that some vps are better paid than I thought so I would not mind going down a level and revised down comp.
 I find the management side of things quite draining actually, and I don't feel the numbers add up to justify it.
 Wondering if anyone ever went though the same process? Internally or applied externally for an lower rung role?

If memory serves, the bootable tool would do something to the kernel to basically allowing any value to be typed into the password field. The utility did not reset or modify any system or passwords, just allowed bypass.
 I have the need of gaining admin access to a device, but due to the nature of the device, I need to do so in a way that does not modify any system files in any manner.
 Any help appreciated!

 zune-jpeg's performance is on par with libjpeg-turbo, an extensively optimized library that has more assembly in it than C. Matching that performance in pure Rust is an outstanding achievement!
 Because of this change, the obscure "lossless JPEG" format used almost exclusively in medical imaging is no longer supported. If you need to handle lossless JPEG, we recommend using jpeg-decoder directly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently lost my job. I didn't particularly like it, so it's not sad in that sense; however, the financial implications are obviously less than ideal.
 I've been interested in cybersecurity for a long time and even took the CompTIA Security+ certification a few years ago just for fun, but that is the extent of my relevant experience. I want to use this as an opportunity to upskill myself and finally break into a field that I am genuinely passionate about, and I do not mind starting from the bottom. I have enough saved that I can go at this full time, 8-10 hours a day, for the next 4 months. Importantly, I have basically no other commitments.
 I have outlined a plan:
  
 Month 1: TryHackMe + HTB boxes with walkthrough to get the basics down and document all progress. 
 Month 2: Study for and take the PNPT (can't afford the OSCP), continue with HTB and THM. 
 Month 3: Renew Security+ cert and start applying for tons of jobs, keep going at it with HTB and THM. 
 Month 4: Keep applying, and hopefully get some interviews, and keep doing the same stuff and document all progress. And if I get no results maybe try my luck in Bug Bounty hunting.
  
I know this is a massive undertaking, and I realize it's going to be a tough few months. But I've always seemed to learn quickly, and I'm very committed to making this happen.
 I would greatly appreciate any feedback, critique, and advice that could help me in my journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've written pktstat-bpf, a simple replacement for ncurses/libpcap-based pktstat, using Linux eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) program, allowing packet statistics gathering even under very high traffic volume conditions, typically several million packets per second even on an average server. In this scenario (high volume, DoS attacks etc.) typically regular packet capture solutions start being unreliable due to increasing packet loss.
 By default it uses TC (Traffic Control) eBPF hooks with TCX attaching requiring at minimum Linux kernel v6.6 for both ingress and egress traffic statistics. Alternatively it can switch to XDP (eXpress Data Path) hook but with a consequence of losing egress statistics since XDP works only in ingress path. XDP mode due to XDP program to network interface attaching calls requires at minimum Linux kernel v5.9. Some distributions might have backported XDP/TC patches (notable example is Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel) and eBPF program might work on older kernels too.
 When using XDP on SmartNICs (100GE and more) it is possible to run in XDP Offloaded mode where XDP program loads directly on NIC with hardware XDP support and executes without using CPU, allowing wire speed statistics even on 100+Gbps speeds.
 At the end of the execution program will display per-IP and per-protocol statistics sorted by per-connection bps, packets and (source-IP:port, destination-IP:port) tuples, either in plaintext or as JSON.
 Program consists of the eBPF code in C and the pure-Go userland Golang program that parses and outputs final IP/port/protocol/bitrate statistics. Go part of the program uses wonderful cillium/ebpf library to load and run eBPF program, interfacing with eBPF map.
 I would be glad to hear about any improvements, bugs or otherwise. File an issue or ping me in the comments. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apart from using an actual debugger - in some cases you can’t have a debugger attached to the process, or the behavior you’re facing is complex and emergent, and you cannot just put a breakpoint or log statement there. If attaching a debugger is possible, then of course I just attach a debugger.
 Let me share mines:
  
Isolate - if something’s tricky, try to have the simplest isolated reproduction that you can have. This cuts out unnecessary complexity and usually also speeds up iterations.
 Isolate early - it’s tempting to think that “I just need to fix this here, redeploy and it’ll probably work”, but I found that more often than not, I should have isolated the case earlier. It’s balancing between the likelihood of fixing it in place in a couple of iterations with a longer cycle and between investing time upfront in the isolation to have shorter feedback cycle. Also, the skill of efficiently isolating cases is something that improves with practice.
 “Approach from two ends” - I’m not sure if this has a name, sometimes it can be called ‘binary search’. When I tried everything that I could think of but it all doesn’t seem to make any sense, then I step back and try to ‘brute force’ it. This usually starts by taking my problematic case on one end, and a known working example of what I’m trying to achieve on the other end. Then I start modifying on both ends: stripping down parts on the first end, and adding more and more parts on the other end, so that they become more and more similar. At some point, the difference that I didn’t think of pops out. A similar approach also works for example if a new release of an app has a regression, but it’s not clear from the code change why - then we can start producing synthetic approximation releases in a test environment to see where exactly things break. I really like this approach, it really helped me solve cases where I had no idea why things don’t work.

 Someone purchased my game recently and ran it on a very low spec Linux laptop. They knew full well that they didn't meet the system requirements, but wanted to try it anyway. Turned out the game ran pretty awfully on Proton because of their hardware, the framerate skipped wildly around, their progress kept getting wiped out, and certain textures either didn't load or popped in after several minutes.
 I had put off building for Linux until I could boot it up myself on an old PC, so I spent the day trying to debug the issue with them and figure out if there were certain settings that could improve their experience.
 In the end, we couldn't find any fixes. So I took a leap of faith, put all my chips on Godot and just blindly built a Linux version for them without testing it, figuring it probably wouldn't work but was worth a shot.
 It worked PERFECTLY, first try, no issues.
 Love this engine, love you guys. Shown above is me and the new player absolutely dumbfounded by Godot effortlessly taking care of business.

 It was one thing doing a bootcamp in 2021 or even 2022, but operating a bootcamp in 2023 and 2024 is straight up fucking fraud. These are real people right now taking out massive loans to attend these camps. Real people using their time and being falsely advertised to. Yeah, they should have done their diligence but it still shouldn't exist.
 It's like trying to start a civil engineering bootcamp with the hopes that they can get you to build a bridge in 3 months. The dynamics of this field have changed to where a CS degree + internships is basically the defacto 'license' minimum for getting even the most entry level jobs now.

Your responses were helpful, comical (roasting mgr), and most importantly emphasizing the true scope and scale of the request as being largely unrealistic. I checked out the recommended tools, and some of you gave me avenues for quick shortcuts and workarounds, but overall I was convinced that this is not worth trying to any appreciable degree. My fear is getting too deep into a project only to fail to deliver, and I was armed with enough general consensus to make an informed statement to stakeholders that the project, as outlined, was not feasible without outside resources in this timeframe. With that, I showed them RenPy and said I could deliver on a visual novel, nothing more, and that it could be both informative and interactive, but…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There really is too much to know these days, what areas are there to specialize in?
 My thoughts:
 Kubernetes - I can see why some engineers love it. An awesome paradigm at the base layer and so much interesting built on top of it.
 Observability - almost a science in itself and plenty to get into (or related to) be it monitoring, alerting, analytics, service management. 
 Platform management - building out a consumable platform, kinda like being a developer for developers.
 Architect - the problem I have with this is developers are going to have their own software architects doing system design that the may overlap already with the infra side. Also many expect engineers to have software architects skills anyway. So where does that leave the cloud/DevOps architect? I feel there is not much mileage in this path.
 Any others? As each year passes the more I think it is not a good idea to stay in the middle as a generalist and time to pick a path.

 Godot Project Builder is a graphical automation tool for exporting and publishing Godot projects. It supports automated tasks for exports, uploading to popular stores (Steam, GOG, Epic, itch io) and basic file operations, all configured using a convenient GUI.
 It's available as a project (requires at least Godot 4.3 dev6) or executable. You can get it here: https://github.com/KoBeWi/Godot-Project-Builds or in the AssetLib. Includes installable plugin for quick launch directly from your project.
 Project Builder supports exporting projects both from Godot 4 and Godot 3.

 I didn’t know GitHub Actions was free when the repo is public. This makes it SOO much easier to get started with the project, so thank you stranger who suggested this!

 The Azure DevOps version is still there in its own branch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Recently I joined company with very bad codebase. Plain react with javascript, no standards, no linting or type checking, first changes dating back to 2015. Codebase is editied by everything based on their needs, so you can image quality of the code.
 Converting to typescript is impossible due to scope and lack of human resources. Everyone in the team likes current setup and really not cares about improving. Mgnment wants me to improve everything (they don’t know what, they just want to be sure that project is up to these days standarts) and fix bugs that noone can fix. So naturally other devs are maximum junior-mid level.
 I feel like I am loosing my skills and this is my biggest worry. I am super afraid to become bad at coding after working in these kind of projects. I am literally abandoning typescript and good coding standarts. No one wants to do big improvements or changes, only me. Should I try to do something about it or better not waste my time and switch company? I have joined this company due to pay raise, but it feels like skills cut…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a fairly experienced dev with a broad knowledge so I tend to move around teams as needed. It's kind of my thing and companies like it because I always work on top priorities.
 However this has exposed me to the fact that every single local build never ever works initially. Normally there are some docs slightly out of date, you follow them and error. Some unhappy container, undefined variables, some stuff that doesn't install, unit tests won't run.
 The only way to make it run is to fight through it during long several days of debugging, normally heavily assisted by someone in the team that has the right lore (normally this person is busy for the same reason so can only help here and there) 
 It kills me that in my 10 plus years I haven't seen much progress in this part of the dev cycle. Docker was supposed to fix it but then we made stuff around docker complex. We have fancy complicated and fragil infra. Don't get me started with stuff like bazel. When Mr bazel had enough and leaves the company, it becomes the "we don't know what that does so don't touch it" and it's exactly where it will break when I'm trying to get up to speed. 
 Sorry a bit ranty. 
 Have I been unlucky in my career or have you seen this issue too? Have you found some strategies that solve or help with this?

 Can you share some of the cool projects you have built ? Any project ideas to share ?
 Would also like to know what all projects you put up in your resume to get your first job ? Have you deployed the projects you have put up in your resume ?
 Any tips or anything for a beginner trying to get job in this tiring market?
 Also can you share some open source projects I can try to contribute ? Ik it's hard but It sounds cool to contribute on cool projects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been developing games and I feel very confident in being able to program most mechanics and systems. I also am very confident in my model and rigging skills. While developing games though they tend to feel very sandbox-y and tend to not feel quite as polished as a lot of professionally made games. I’ve added some polish techniques like invisible walls, more linear level design but they still feel “projecty” and not at the level of a product. Any tips and tricks anyone has to make their games feel more professional?

 Please don’t suggest me the ZX spectrum or other Sinclair computers because those don’t have any kind of graphics chip or sound in many cases.
 I am more interested in suggestions around Commodore 64, Apple IIc, IBM XT or similar computers. 
 Thanks in advance.
 P.D. My real goal is to understand how much harder an old school computer emulator is compared to a GameBoy or NES emulator.
 I don’t know if I am being naive but the existence of family basic for the Nintendo Famicom leads me to believe that an old micro computer could be very similar to old consoles in term of emulation

 Hi! I recently (finally!) finished a planned blog post introducing the Lua runtime piccolo and I wanted to share it here. This is not a new project, and I've talked about it before, but it has recently resumed active work, and I've never had a chance to actually talk about it properly before in public in one place that I can point to.
 This is not meant as an advertisement to use piccolo or to even contribute to piccolo as much as it is a collection of thoughts about stackless interpreters, garbage collection, interpreter design, and (sort of) a love letter to coroutines. It is also a demo of piccolo and what makes it unique, and there are some examples for you to try out in live REPLs on the blog post.
 I hope you find it interesting!

 How do you ensure that your monitoring stack is working as expected and you didn't messed up the config?
 If you're using a Saas (Grafana cloud, datadog, whatever) do you have another solution that will alert you in case of an outage?
 Maybe it's just that there's no simple solution that's worth the effort. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

So I boot up some games I played in the past, games that I loved, no luck either. I am a solo game developer, so there’s no escaping the play testing phase. Does anyone else have this problem?

 I'm 7 years into this. I want to exit at 10 years to do something else after paying off my home - paying off the home so that I can afford to go down in income. 
 Right now I'm balancing my full time job with my side gig that I'd like to eventually transition to a full time gig. 
 Anyone else doing this? So many people want to transition into tech that I feel like I hear fewer stories of seasoned tech employees transitioning out of tech, though I know it must be a thing and I am not the only one.

The DMCA takedown request has images of the "infringing works" but all of the claimed assets are from different mod from the same game that my mod is for, none of those assets are in my mod or hosted on my server.
 My hosting company has given me two options: 1) remove the infringing content or 2) reply with a valid DMCA counter-notice and wait 10 days. My problem is that I have no infringing content to remove and I don't want to wait 10 days to bring my server back online.
 Has anyone dealt with false DMCA takedown requests? I would like to be transparent and publicly post the full DMCA request and evidence for my community so they can know what is going on and see that we have infringed on nothing. Is this worth getting a lawyer for? This is a hobby project that doesn't take donations so paying thousands of dollars for a lawyer isn't an option.

 Now that brings me to the title. 
 If you're someone who does system design interviews for Staff+ positions, what are the reasons you reject them? 
 Assume the scenario where the candidate thinks it went well. Yet you looked for some important things and you reject them. Why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just went to start our biweekly meeting on a major branch of our product, and a coworker juts in and kicks it off themselves instead, saying everything has been reprioritized. They apparently had a random in-person meeting with the superior behind my back where they talked status and prioritization. There was no outreach or status inquiry on my end as the lead.
 I don't really know how else to take it. Seems not random to me, and it feels like I'm getting edged out for some reason.
 Have you guys had something like this happen before? Should I position one way or another in response to this?
 I've always ran the meeting in the past, and we're ahead of schedule. It just seems weird that they've taken the reigns and spoken in my place when I was the lead on it. Maybe I'm reading into it but it seems pretty blatant.

 Hi everyone!
 I posted about Luminal a few months ago, and since then we've made significant progress in the CUDA and Metal compilers.
 For those who don't know, Luminal is a a deep learning library that uses composable compilers to achieve high performance. It's entirely written in Rust and orders of magnitude simpler than comparable ML frameworks.
 Recently we've been working on speeding up performance on Nvidia and Apple GPUs, which led us to write compilers capable of generating kernels on the fly. These kernels are compiled once and ran many times, and since the whole compute graph is known at compile time, we can get very aggressive with the kernel optimizations.
 We're adding tons more features (autograd landed a few weeks ago, so training is now possible!) so check out the blog post and the repo if you'd like to know more!

 But in software, things change so fast that you never really get to 'expert' level, and always need to keep learning new things. 
 So how long do people usually keep this going? And does upskilling get challenging with age?
 I've rarely ever worked with engineers who were in their 50s or above, and the few I have worked with seemed like they did struggle.
 Is this a career for the young and not something you should plan to do for the rest of your life?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really love working on Rust up until I have to add async to the mix. Lately I just avoid adding async at all costs because it just comes with so many caveats and gotchas that the effort is sometimes not worth the performance improvement. Some of the things that I absolutely find annoying:
  
async is not part of rust, it's a library. The main one being Tokio with no real alternative. I applaud the work done on this but it all just feels horribly hacky. 
 
any time you have to use async you taint all your functions and types with it. As if dropping a bucket of paint (worse than paint but let's keep it civil) all over your code. It makes refactoring a horrible experience. As you crawl your codebase to make it async you eventually end up with an impossible task and have to find ugly alternatives (looking at you async fn in traits)
 
while the rust compiler has been an amazing tool along the journey, it just fails miserably with async. It won't complain at all if you forgot to remove a blocking fs call in an async context and of course it will fail horribly at run time. And when the program eventually crashes, it will just render the most obscure stacktrace i've ever seen. FAR from the developper experience of vanilla Rust.
 
 Overall for such a great language with so many features, it just feels broken as soon as you put your finger in the async business. I ve been looking at the async improvement proposals but apart from async fn traits, i just don't see anything revolutionary that would make the experience better. 
 At some point, shouldn't it just be part of the language if async Rust is to improve in a major way ? 
 Disclaimer: I am not a Rust expert, but i ve been programming for 25+ years in many different languages.

 Not even mentioning the pay — market has capped it on a level 5 years ago at least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am writing a C64 emulator as my first real emulator project after CHIP 8. As of now I have implemented the CPU, bank switching and rendering the screen memory. 
 I loaded up the character, basic and kernal roms and it expectedly didn't work right away. I fixed a couple of bugs but it still doesn't work and I feel stuck.
 The code seems to execute normally but at some point it enters this section of code and it is stuck in this loop infinitely: 
 ramtz1 inc tmp0+1 ;move index thru memory ramtz2 lda (tmp0),y ;get present data tax ;save in .x lda #$55 ;do a $55,$aa test sta (tmp0),y cmp (tmp0),y bne size rol a sta (tmp0),y cmp (tmp0),y bne size txa ;restore old data sta (tmp0),y iny bne ramtz2 beq ramtz1 
 It seems to me that the bne size instructions are the only way out of the loop, but I dont get how they would ever trigger. It stores the accumulator value into memory and then just compares the accumulator against the the memory location the accumulator was just stored in. How are they ever not equal?
 I must be missing something.

 I'm having multiple issues, specifically in the PPU. Ice Climber is the most obvious with the title screen demo. But Donkey Kong has a broken main menu with a bunch of blue 0's. The demo has a bunch of magenta 0's at the bottom, and the screen shifts a ton randomly.
 Baloon Fight is the best one, with no obvious glitches.
 This is what I currently have: https://gist.github.com/TaromaruYuki/5c3821a024b6e44a733bf3f67bb6673a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I recently bought an electronics set which had a joystick module, and on the request of my senior in college, I'm thinking of making an emulator which runs on a raspberry pi module with the same joystick. But I've never made an emulator in my life, so do you have any resources which a beginner like me could refer and learn from to build this emulator.

 Hi again! Last time i posted here was in 2019 I think with my chip-8 emulator. Now I have a created an Intel 8080 emulator!
 It started out as a space invaders emulator but I got more interested in creating a disassembler/debugger and implementing all the instructions instead :)
 For those interested in creating an intel 8080 emulator i have modified the (common?) test cpudiag.bin rom since it assumes the start address is 255 and not 0 which makes all the jumps/calls go to the wrong addresses.
 Links to source code and test rom:

 cpudiagFixed.bin

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm positively surprised by the performance. It struggled to keep framerate at 10fps. I've refactored bunch of places which had sub-optimal code, but what really done wonders is moving from usage of emscripten_set_main_loop to Emscripten's Asyncify.
 Next steps:
  
Addressing some graphical bugs in other games (I've found some minor ones in Tetris in Excitebike)
 Implementing Controllers
 Implementing other common mappers other than NROM which is implemented at this moment.
 Implementing APU.
 UI tweaks (Right now, the thing that is buzzing me is the label of file input, that cannot be changed and it depends on browser language; Polish in my case, so I'm thinking about making custom one)
