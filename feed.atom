        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a long time implementing each dynamically allocated part of my codebase from scratch I've decided to write my own vector system.
 It is implemented as a runtime vector. We store information such as the size of each element, the amount of them that are allocated and there are helper functions that do things like retrieving the element count or getting a pointer to a specific element using pointer arithmetic.
 The thing is that I'm afraid that this will penalize me in the speed. I've seen many people (and even some C++ compilers) implementing compile time vectors, where we generate the structures, procedures and all using macro generics. That seems to be faster than the runtime counterpart. But they seem harder to manage too.
 The good thing about runtime vectors though is that the executable size will be significantly smaller as we don't need to recreate every vector function for every type.
 Anyway, I just wanted to ask your opinion on this. Should I rewrite my runtime vector as a compile vector?

 Intellisense auto complete workaround:
 Intellisense really struggles to properly parse C++ modules, but recently I learned that it's because Intellisense doesn't properly understand module partitions. If your module is a single interface file that doesn't import module partitions then Intellisense is able to provide full auto complete support.

 So far I used glfw to make a window and that's it.
 I need some help to understand what exactly is meant by gpu accelerated, for eg:- Kitty is said to be a gpu accelerated terminal emulator, it uses glfw too. So basically anything that is rendered on the window will be drawn will be rendered by the gpu? (but isn't everything on the screen rendered by the gpu?). Also to add the editor part of the application I need an UI so I was thinking using gtk for that what is the difference between that and something like that and something like Leif that is gpu accelerated.
 Sorry if they are novice questions. Thnx!

 I want to use C (I can do several higher level languages) and I have some questions, since for the higher level languages, that seems not a problem (or not such a big one) since they run on their VM.
 So - first, how do I know which C version do I take? Where can I download the libraries for my approach that is: I want an established long term version that runs onto my machine right away, nothing fancy,nothing edge ?
 which libraries do I absolutely need? (I understand that there is not a "total package" like for Java)? .. is there some auto-generative list that will create/download such package?
 Different flavors seem to exist, so I run Linux and I like the bash .. what is suitable?
 .. I am interested in mainly doing regex work.
 Thank you very much!
 Edit: I have tried to find answers to the questions and there is _a lot to read_ but I do not want to learn programming, and I do not want to switch from java to c, .. I just want to use it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built a library that migrates JSON / BSON documents during deserialization. I still try to write backwards compatible code where possible, but sometimes it's really hard to maintain and In those situations I find it easier to apply migrations to my database. However, since I don't want to incur the downtime / performance hit of applying the migrations to my entire database in one go - instead I migrate each document transparently on deserialization when it's needed.
 Here's a link to the repo if you're interested.
 Whilst it's slower then using System.Text.Json directly it's still pretty quick - in my simple benchmark it's only 0.001ms to deserialize & migrate a document

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are (at least) 2 properties of the Go compiler that I find fascinating, especially compared to other languages:
  
It is blazingly fast
 Cross-compilation is incredibly easy and straightforward; as far as I know you can easily compile for any target platform (OS/architecture) on any other platform
  
My confusion (and question) is, what is the secret sauce behind this? And then of course also, why don't other languages do this?
 For example, I have used Kotlin a lot professionally and (in my experience) its compiler is really slow (building a fresh project feels like that "compiling!" XCKD: https://xkcd.com/303/). It can easily take several seconds to compile what it needs to run a unit test, even in small apps. Even after just changing a few files, it can take up to a second to compile (all depending on hardware of course). My experience with Go is that compiling rarely takes multiple seconds (with small apps, several up to maybe 30 seconds with bigger apps that I've worked with) and after changing only a few files it's nearly instantaneous...
 On the other point, I have recently started writing some command line apps in Rust, but I primarily develop on MacOS (Apple Silicon) and want to run the apps on my Linux (hobby) server (AMD64). I found it non-trivial to set up the linker so that it worked as expected (especially compared to Go where you just set GOOS and GOARCH and you're set).
 I believe I have once seen a video where it was explained that Go code first compiles into a kind of Go-specific assembly, and then "only" needs to translate that assembly to each platform's assembly. I don't know if that's still the case, but if that makes it so easy and flexible, why aren't more programming languages doing that?

 I have a Base class, and a Derived class. Derived has an array of "referrers", which is a vector of Base*, and the Base class need to store his reference, which is a Derived*.
 So these are my (simplified) classes:
 class Base { public: Derived* Ref=nullptr; void SetReference(Derived* Reference) {Ref=Reference;}; }; class Derived : public Base { public: Base* BaseRef=nullptr; void AddReferrer(Base* Referrer) { BaseRef=Referrer; BaseRef->SetReference(this); }; }; 
 The problem is obvious: Base know nothing about Derived and can't compile; forward declaration won't help.
 How can this problem be solved?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like the title says. I am currently working on a game in C++/Java where the rendering part is done in C++. I am using MinGW as my compiler on Windows and GCC on Linux. I have come to the point I can share an early version of my game with friends but all of them keep getting errors that dependent libraries could not be located. I have 4 devices at home from which 1 is a Windows machine. And my game runs on all of them. So imagine my surprise.
 One of my friends is a gamedev too and after much trial and error we learned he was missing dll files that are located in my MinGW bin folder. After providing these dll files the game ran. But I thought I got rid that problem by linking to libgcc and libstdc++ statically.
 While it works now I still rather not be forced to share that whole bunch of dll files to my players when the game releases. So I was wondering if I am doing it right. Here is the part of my CMakeLists file:
 ```
 Generate variables for the compiler and linker
 set(ARQ_LIBRARIES glfw freetype soloudw dl -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -Wl,-rpath='$ORIGIN:$ORIGIN/lib')
 if (WIN32) set(ARQ_LIBRARIES glfw3 freetype soloudw -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++) endif (WIN32)
 Configure include and link folders
 include_directories(include/)
 if (WIN32) include_directories(arqanore PUBLIC "C:/Include") link_directories(arqanore PUBLIC "C:/Lib") endif (WIN32)
 link_libraries(${ARQ_LIBRARIES})
 Configure arqanore
 add_library(arqanore ${ARQ_INCLUDE} ${ARQ_SRC}) set_target_properties(arqanore PROPERTIES POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON) set_target_properties(arqanore PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME "arqanore") set_target_properties(arqanore PROPERTIES VERSION ${ARQ_VERSION}) ```
 And this a screenshot of some of the dll files from MinGW I was talking about: https://imgur.com/OZvzXKa. The actual list of files is rather long so I cannot capture them on one screenshot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm a programmer who primarily uses C. But I want to expand my horizons and learn Assembly and low level concepts. I understand some ideas like the stack and registers. But I still fail to fully understand Assembly. I was wondering if developing an emulator might be a good way to understand the more low level concepts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello and thank you for reading. I am currently programming software as a graduation project for my specialization in software engineering.
 The software, in terms of providing the response I need, works and works very well. However, I decided to implement something similar to the Result pattern, and that’s where the headache started.
 The current way the system works is as follows. I have a microservice called ApiGateway, which is responsible for exposing all the system's capabilities at the API level.
 For practical and summarized purposes, ApiGateway communicates via gRPC with the AccessControl microservice. Everything internally in this latter microservice works perfectly fine, but when it’s time to return the information via gRPC, the data simply disappears. It doesn't arrive as it is…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is my first crack at writing malware. Its a lightweight Remote Access Trojan in Rust. Any feedback and suggestions would be greatly appreciated, especially in regards to advancing the obfuscation and evasion mechanisms. If you wanna play around with it the pre built release is on github along with the source, here: (Art3misRAT Github). Note that the ip is set to 127.0.0.1 in the release so it will only work on local machine, if you wanna connect to a remote ip you'll have to build from source. Hoping to evolve it into a free tool for the community with enough useful features, but primarily to evade AV detection since Meterpreter seems to be very difficult to get past windows defender lately. Hope yall like it and any feedback is greatly appreciated! Edit: Use it responsibly and legally!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am, by title, a Senior Software Engineer, and I don't truly feel like one yet. I want to really start feeling like one and make myself more knowledgeable and marketable.
 I want to dedicate 1 hour a night to learning. I haven't done 'learning' in a while because of how busy my lead role has been for the past 3 years or so. I learn things as they come up at work and obviously learn what not to do in the role. I'm looking for suggestion (and maybe what to learn from, videos, books, etc) what that learning should be. The only real 'book' I've read was Clean Code and it was amazing.
 Asterisk goes here, I am a bootcamp grad that got in when it was hot, with 2 prior years of college that included programming courses (using C)
 Things I am very comfortable answering questions about in an interview:
 NodeJS
 Typescript
 Javascript
 HTML/CSS
 Testing (tdd/bdd, unit, integration, etc)
 REST
 Easy Leetcode problems are usually easy to me and go in this category
 Soft skills go here (team work and communication, office politics, customer service, team buy in, fixing an outage, etc).
 
 Things I am comfortable talking about my years of experience using, but could learn more:
 Angular2/JS
 React
 SQL/NoSQL
 Relational databases with ORMs
 Docker
 Azure
 SOLID
 OOP (This and SOLID could be in the above list but I'm not totally sure)
 Git (I can push and pull with the best of them, anything else Im combing through docs)
 Medium Leetcode problems are solvable here sometimes and can be difficult for me depending on the problem
 
 Things I am not comfortable saying I am proficient in:
 AWS
 Kubernetes
 Linux
 CI CD
 Distributed Systems
 "Classic" data structures ( I know what a binary tree and linked lists are though? )
 Hard leetcode problems. I've really never bothered with them.
 
 If you've read all of this thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a developer for a few years and I'm trying to learn C while I'm analysing some open source projects and I think I can tell some things about my experience.
 It's particularly focused on NGINX plugins and it seems like it's almost impossible to track everything that is going on inside a customized NGINX instance. I mean, the structure is made of uncountable "customizers" that you can append to the main library and it is full of "anonymous functions" that will be invoked at the right time.
 The syntax is not difficult, but reading the source code to get a full ideia of what is going on is a difficult task. I think I want to dig deeper into the code anyways, and make a diagram of the chain of invocations between registering a module and actually calling the handler when the requests comes.
 Also, they don't have a good documentation, at least I didn't find it. Please tell me if these are good ideas, if you would like to see this analysis, if my first impressions are correct and if maybe I'm wasting my time because someone already published something like that.
 Thank you very much.

 I've made a few mobile games in the past and am currently working on a RPG game that I wanted to play but couldn't find out there, this is a game that even if it was never released, would scratch an itch that I personally had. (For context it's a super grindy (but non-ai) open world text game which I hope will offer years of gameplay).
 But I'm finding that knowing how all the mechanics work under the covers, the bosses, the special moves etc. kind of sucked the fun (and mystique?) out of actually playing the game. I mean, making the game is still fun, and I've had test players who report positively on the game, but seems like I've catch 22'd myself, since this was something that I wanted to play myself.
 *Not sure why comments are not showing on this post, I assume once a mod unlocks them I can read everyone's responses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have 20 years of experience working on the web with Java and PHP. I want to create websites that run more efficiently on cheap VPSs (serving a variety of individual customers). I'm hesitant to keep C++, Go, Rust. And started researching web development with Go (Although before that I tried a project with Swift using the Vapor framework to create an API for a project already running with PHP Laravel). After 6 months of experience with Go, several first products were created. Create 3 libraries: FluentSQL, FluentModel, and gFly (Laravel inspired web framework written in Go). I used gFly code base to create 2 websites for customers. I'm impressed with Go's performance, memory usage, and flexibility for basic and advanced website needs, as well as microservices deployments. I also tried using Wails to create a desktop application (Go+ReactJS) to create a manager for the MikroTik router. And create a few other small CLI utilities. My personal conclusion is that Go is too simple but really effective. Easy to learn and quick to produce.
 I will create a few experiments converting old projects or creating new ones with Go language for further evaluation and future decisions.

I see this is because the program runs really fast and its like all threads are at the same point just waiting on the lock and past my condition to terminate the thread. When I use sleep to slow the program down sometimes all threads exit other times one wont exit(depends on how much I slow it down).
 I've been thinking of trying to use pthread_cancel and some other function calls but this seems like a more easy alternative. How can i use trylock to loop other threads while the lock is already held. 
 while(1){ while(pthread_mutex_trylock(&dead->getLock) == (int)EBUSY); // Just stalls the program if(condition){ // Only true after a certian condition is met exit; } Acquire Lock ..... Check if conditions are met. Signal Unlock } exit

I am not sure if I should get the A+ certification and get a tech support job since even my applications for unpaid internships are not getting a reply. My degree is from WGU I have no experience in the field that’s probably the reason why I am not getting any responses. I have done a full-stack project in Angular springboot. But it seems like not many employers are hiring with Java background. Can anyone please give me some advice on how to get a junior dev position. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like come across anti-DRY advice much more than pro-DRY these days. I get that you can go too far in either direction but in my experience repeated code is much more trouble than overly DRY code. 
 I've spent the last 4 years working on and refactoring a long running product that needed a lot of cleanup when I started. Lots of repeated code AND lots of overabstraction (eg. inheritance chains 7 deep). The repeated code was by far more troublesome. The real killer is that repeated code would drift apart over the years, and it was impossible to know if it was deliberate or accidental. eg. does this copy just have a bug? or is it a deliberate change? or can this code path just not get into this state? Dealing that problem is an order of magnitude worse than just wrapping your head around extreme abstractions. 
 For that reason alone, I would generally advice people to err on the DRY side as opposed to the other. Atleast with DRY code, you have a source of truth to work from, even if it's a giant mess. 
 One thought is that it could be related to timescales. The longer code has been around, the worse the drift can get. For projects that have only been around for 3-5 years, maybe it won't get too bad. (In my case, it's a >10 year old product)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, we lost one of the great minds of our generation. Daniel dedicated the last 14 years of his life to creating an academic model for real-time threading. This work eventually led to the Linux Kernel runtime verification (RV), providing a practical use case for these models. He authored RTLA (Realtime Latency Analysis tool) that provides analysis of real-time performance and debugging based on models generated from RV. This marked a revolutionary approach to kernel debugging that relied on BPF and tracers to build live models of the current system state, as opposed to the historical method of black-box statically generated system states (i.e., kernel dumps and trace-cmd). 
 While his work focused on real-time models, RV's reach expanded to general models of the stock Linux kernel (PREEMPT RT disabled) and successfully replaced tools like trace-cmd and, in some use cases, kdump. Today, I want to not only mourn the kernel legend that he had become but also the man himself. I had the honor of working with him, and the joy he brought into each and every room cannot be overstated. He blended a unique combination of compassion and genius that is rarely seen in the field of computer science, particularly at the level he reached. I will forever miss our casual fireside chats, our light-hearted debates about the best Prosecco drinks, and much, much more. RIP Daniel, you will be deeply missed by everyone in the community.

 Alas, at least on my machine UTF-8 input still doesn't work in a plain original console window, and therefore not in MinTTY-based environments such as Git bash or MSYS2 bash either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://openjdk.org/jeps/8316779 introduces the concept of null-restricted types.
 I was wondering; why does this JEP have to be coupled with the Valhalla project? Can't it be delivered independently, much earlier?
 The JEP effort is described as XL, but as I read through the description I note that the vast majority of the complexity comes from introducing the concept of zero instances, implicit constructors, heap flattening, atomic read/writes, etc.
 None of these concepts seem to be a hard requirement for null-restricted types. In fact, the vast majority of them seem to be implementation-level details that are specific to Valhalla. They can be introduced later on if necessary. 
 Couldn't we reduce the scope of the JEP by moving these concepts into the Valhalla JEP, and delivering this feature as a compile-time syntactic sugar?
 The benefit of introducing null-restricted types to Java is rather large, and the risk of releasing it as a preview feature without these other concepts seems to be low. So why not do it?
 With respect to these other concepts, we could introduce a compile-time check preventing null-restricted types from being accessed before they are initialized. We already do this for superclass fields and local variables. Developers are used to this concept. This eliminates the need for zero instances and implicit constructors.
 Nothing prevents us from removing this restriction when/if we decide to add these concepts at a later time. Though, I honestly don't understand why we would want to introduce these concepts when we could simply deny access to uninitialized variables. It seems much easier to implement and understand.
 I know that the language designers are a very smart bunch of people, so I must be missing something... What am I missing? 😀

 This is all I'm doing in StackTest.cpp

 For my sanity (and to sharpen my skills), I’ve decided to dedicate some of my free time to building and tinkering with projects. However, every time I sit down to start something, I end up staring at a blank screen, and my mind just goes blank.
 I’m looking for suggestions on what to build or work on. Here are a few areas I’m interested in, but I’m open to any and all ideas:
 1. CI/CD Pipelines: Always looking to improve and innovate here. 2. Automation: Tools and scripts that can streamline processes. 3. Cloud Infrastructure: I’m particularly interested in AWS, but I’m open to exploring other providers. 4. Monitoring and Logging: Enhancing observability with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, etc. 5. Security: Implementing security best practices in the pipeline and infrastructure. 6. Kubernetes: Anything from setting up clusters to advanced scheduling and scaling techniques. 
 I’m also very interested in contributing to open source projects. If you know of any active projects that could use some DevOps love, please point me in the right direction. I’d love to help out and collaborate with the community.
 If you’ve worked on a project that you found particularly interesting or challenging, I’d love to hear about it. Or if you have any other ideas, please share!
 Thanks in advance!

 A lot of people were jumping straight into saying "that's too low, find better" but its my understanding that markets fluctuate based on area and demand, so I made a comment saying "don't listen to people throwing numbers at you without asking for more information. $50k entry level is totally reasonable where I live." And it got downvoted by everyone.
 Am I actually wrong here? Because the time I spent in this sub, it seems like a lot of you work for faang-level companies in high cost-of-living areas where demand for good developers is a lot higher. In areas like that I can totally understand not accepting $50k entry level, but for a small factory town like mine with a low cost-of-living and low demand for developers at all, I think $50k entry is very reasonable.
 If I'm wrong please don't downvote me all to hell. If I'm wrong I just wanna know why.

 I have my first interview coming up soon (as a 2nd year B.sc student of CS), and it's for a DevOps student position in one of the big companies.
 I've spoken to the team manager as an initial phone interview, and she hinted at me that I'm not supposed to know so many things about DevOps (she knows I'm a student), and in the interview I'd be asked "logical" questions, and maybe some algorithms (in the technical part, of course that there is a regular, personal interview part).
 In your experience, how should i prepare for the interview?
 My current thinking is learning about the basics of DevOps (version control, Linux, CI/CD tools, cloud etc.)- but really only the basics of most of them, as well as practicing general interviewing, and grinding Leetcode questions. I'll mention I have less than a week until the interview. 
 Also, I'll use the opportunity and ask what do you think of DevOps as a student position? does it "lock me" in DevOps style jobs further on?
 How can I take advantage of this first job to advance my skills as much as I can?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of years ago I was introduced to the world of C#, specifically making basic native Windows apps in Winforms. When I started this project I decided to take it to the next level and use WPF, it was fairly easy to learn and more modern than Winforms. 
 So this is how Stack Solver was born: an open-source app that optimizes the process of loading boxes on a pallet in the most efficient way. What distinguishes it from other similar apps are the modern, simple interface (shoutout to WPFUI), the ease of use, the ability to create 3D renderings of the result (again, one more advantage of WPF) and obviously the fact that it's free and open-source unlike the majority of software programs in the domain of logistics and warehouse management.
 I would appreciate any feedback and ideas for improvements. Github repo: https://github.com/VladM7/Stack-Solver
 PS: i know the code is messy because part of it was written when I wasn't that experienced in C#, but I am currently working to bring it to a more organized state.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://layoffs.fyi/
 100k layoffs in 2024, 263k in 2023, and this isn’t counting the smaller layoffs or reduced hiring companies have done. There’s also little to no evidence of a single interest rate drop for the rest of this year. High interest rates for a long time. 
 Job listings are the lowest in years: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE
 Was the Covid demand unprecedented? Yes. That market was unsustainable. However, labor supply has just increased, and doesn’t show many signs of stopping. If job listings are going to be the same amount as 2019, that would normally be fine, if the labor supply didn’t also explode to the moon. 
 CS is still one of the most popular majors in college:
 https://www.coursera.org/articles/most-popular-college-majors#
 “The popularity of computer and information sciences saw 8.7 percent growth year-over-year, the highest of all the majors on this list.”
 I’ve seen people on this sub saying everyone is overreacting. Now do I think tech is going to be done forever and we’ll all be unemployed? No.
 However, there are loads of experienced engineers out there struggling to find work. Salaries have dropped, that’s a fact. Tech is extremely unstable. Even if you do get hired, who knows if you’re next in the chopping block? 
 People are rightfully worried. A lot of people have been laid off and been having trouble finding work.
 The cost of living these days is insane. If you can’t find work in a few months you’ll be forced to take an out of industry job in most circumstances. 
 It just annoys me when engineers on this sub with stable employment (likely work a government job or dodged layoffs) complain that this sub is too doomer and such. There are engineers probably better than you that are struggling to find work. Try to be somewhat empathic to those who lost their source of income.

 I know that union members are stored in the same memory location and the same value is automatically assigned to all other members of the union etc etc
 But visually, don't you think that's it's confusing? ID and age cannot be same. What if they are in some cases? Could they give raise to some vulns? Is there a better way to understand them and represent them in a coherent manner? Have you ever used union in real life projects?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this is not C++ specific but this community is so knowledgeable and helpful that I can only ask here.
 So I'm trying to iterate over the pixels of an image. If it was a grayscale image, I could have done this:
 // This is not exactly my code but I'm trying to simplify for (int y = 0; y < image.height; y++) { for (int x = 0; x < image.width; x++) { image.data[x + y * image.width] = value; } } 
 but what about an rgb image ?
 I tried this:
 for (int y = 0; y < image.height; y++) { for (int x = 0; x < image.width; x++) { // i for channel Index for (int i = 0; i < image.numChannels; i++) { image.data[(x + y * image.width) * image.numChannels + i] = value; } } } 
 This formula (x + y * image.width) * image.numChannels + i works mostly fine except some artifacts on the right and bottom edges but the other problem is that the address sanitizer and my attempts at debugging confirm there is a buffer overrun.
 This is NOT an issue of x and y values because in my actual code they are clamped between 0 and width for x and 0 and height for y.
 I think the issue is that when when x and y become too big the formula just gives very large values. When x become the width and y become the height, the formula becomes (width + height*width) * numChannels which is larger than width * height * numChannels.
 So what is the right formula for indexing values in a mulitchannel image ?

 Code:
 #include <stdio.h> struct abcd{ int x; int y; int z; } m,n; // <--- These are what I mean when I say structure variables void printstructure(struct abcd random){ printf("%s: ", random); } int main(){ printstructure(m); return 0; } So obviously %s didn't work but it was worth a try, and I wanted to ask what should I write so that I can print the name of whichever structure variable gets passed to the funcion.

The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to DoD program executives and acquisition professionals on how to detect software projects that are really using agile development versus those that are simply waterfall or spiral development in agile clothing (“agile-scrum-fall”). 
  
Each and every one of its criteria is to the point. If you can only answer the wrong answers for your organisation, IMO you have no business criticising [Aa]gile.
 Criticise Scrum, SAFe and all those all you want, but your organization is most probably not agile.

The typical implementation that I see allocates as the underlying array an array of void pointers, but this has the limitation of only being able to store pointers. What if you wanted to populate a list with long longs created inside a loop? Those values would go out of scope after the loop terminates; you could malloc those values and store their pointers, but it would be nice to have the long longs all in a row in the underlying array.
 My solution has been to cast the underlying array (void *collection) to a char array (where each element is one byte), use that with the size of the element type to find the appropriate place in memory to store an incoming…]]></summary>

 I added my ViewModels as services
 builder.Services.AddTransient<MainPageViewModel>();
 And then tried to add them to my code behind files
 public partial class MainPage : ContentPage { public MainPage(MainPageViewModel vm) { InitializeComponent(); BindingContext = vm; } } 
 Doing this seems to give errors on my commands in my XAML though, "No DataContext found for Binding SignInCommand".
 If I do away with injecting my viewmodel and instead use this
  <ContentPage.BindingContext> <vm:MainPageViewModel /> </ContentPage.BindingContext> 
 This solves the error but would create new viewmodel every time the page is visited, correct? Is this an acceptable way to handle binding?

 The cAdvRect class will use cAdvPoint, which is a 2D coordinate (X,Y) with some added check and methods, and cAdvSize, which represents a 2D ... size (Width,Height) and has his methods.
 This all should works with int and double, which seems fairly straightforwaerd.
 But there's things i can't sort out:
 1) How can i "force" that all these classes uses the same Type? So that if i use a cAdvRect<double> then i'll have cAdvSize and cAdvPoint using double as well?
 2) If 1) is not possible, how should i write methods like:
 cAdvRect::CenterTo(const cAdvPoint Center)
 if cAdvRect and cAdvPoint uses different types?
 3) How can i "block" unwanted types (as example, longlong or uint_8t)?

 I'm almost done with CS50 Web and I'm currently busy with the Ruby On Rails path in TOP. I planning to learn PHP with Laravel along with something like Java, C# or Golang on the side to improve my skills, but I can't decide which one to learn. I'm leaning towards Java or C# since I feel like their more powerful for general software development. Can anyone give me some advice, please? 
 PS. I like the Google ecosystem more than Microsoft's, but I don't know if that helps in anyway to make my decision easier since Microsoft made C#. But I also might want to do game development later as a hobby, which makes C# better than the others.

 Anyways, throughout the interview I have been talking extensively about Postgres and other database related things as it’s a data engineering role. 
 Eventually they ask me if I have experience with PSQL — they say it as this acronym. First I assume Postgres of course, but I have been talking about that the entire interview, why would they be asking that? I was unsure, so I asked for clarity on what they meant specifically and how it related to sql. Interviewer talks for a minute about how it’s a “batch data processing tool used to parse through chunks of data, as compared to regular sql.” At this point I am extremely confused, thinking it’s some type of 3rd party stored procedure tool. I respond that I’m afraid I do not have experience with this technology, although I do have experience with many tools that are similar.
 I go on and finish the interview talking extensively about Postgres use cases and functions. I mention Postgres by name multiple times. 
 I get a call an hour later saying I was rejected for not knowing PSQL. It turns out they meant Postgres. 🤦‍♂️
 What do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started learning programming with C# and Unity at the beginning of 2022. I used to be able to spend a good amount of time per day to do Unity courses and tutorials. I even did a 3 month live online boot camp.
 But after 2 years of struggling to understand coding I basically haven't learned anything. My mind is completely blank when I try to code on my own. It’s like I have no problem solving skills whatsoever.
 I am aware that learning to code is a hard and long process but how am I supposed to do it when I feel like I can't absorb information. 
 I had dozens of tutors who wanted to help me and most of them stopped teaching me after 1 or 2 sessions. I still want to be a game dev one day and make my own games tho. I just don't understand why it's not clicking in my head.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a challenge to myself before university, I’ve decided to try out a “C++ killer” (Rust). I’ve been learning C++ for about 3-4 years, and wanna expand my toolbox so to speak.
 I’m curious about other people’s experiences regarding this kind of transition. What should I avoid? Are there any thought patterns I should keep in mind? I’ve gone through most of the theoretical/practical beginner material, and want to have a more general grasp of what to expect.
 Thanks in advance!
 Note: I’m not stopping C++, I still have lots to learn, I’m actively learning both in tandem to improve my overall skills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. I've been looking into the ways to create "global" (not truly global but in a namespace) constants. My understanding is that simply declaring something as const or constexpr is not enough, as const implies static, and therefore you can run into ODR violations if the address of such a constant is ever required.
 So from what I've read it seems that the preferable solution is to mark constants at the namespace level as inline constexpr, as this will cause the compiler to inline the constant value where-ever it is used, effectively eliminating the need to resolve symbol definition. For situations where constexpr is not available (such as std::map), or where inlining is not appropriate, the next best solution is to declare it as extern const and defining it in a single .cpp file. Additionally, if a constant is declared in used only in a single .cpp file, then it should be marked as static and/or wrapped in an annoymous namespace.
 How correct is this understanding? I've found it a bit confusing understanding how static and inline change meaning and function between namespace, class and function contexts. Have I understood what inline does correctly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the company I'm working at as a full time salaried employee with a contract (video game developer) was recently bought out by a larger company with an enormous portfolio spanning multiple media fields (this is relevant as you will soon see). As terms of my continued employment, I must sign an inventions clause saying this new company owns any invention I make of any form at any time during my employment (outside of work). Not just video games. Comic books. Movies. Recipes. Anything. I find this highly, comically unethical, so I am not going to sign. I was told if I don't sign, that will count as "resigning", which is BS because I'm not resigning.
 This matters because if I resign, I am not owed severance. But I am not resigning. In my mind, if they want my employment to end because I don't consent to such a draconian state being forced on me due to a purchase, then I think they should have to terminate me without cause and give severance.
 So my questions are:
 1.) Are these types of clauses even enforceable? Really? ANYTHING I work on?
 2.) Can they legally decide that I implicitly resign with some sort of trap card? This is like my opponent moving my piece in chess. How is that allowed? I'm not resigning; you can't just say that you interpret an action I don't take as resigning and make that legally count -- right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am the creator of a small python project. To my surprise, it has a nonzero amount of number of users. Not many, but I do get issues reported and sometimes the occasional pull request.
 But I no longer have the time nor energy to really support the project. Not only that but I dont even really code Python anymore - my day job is primarily using a JVM now.
 What's the best thing to do in this situation?
  
Give ownership of the repo to someone else?
 Encourage others to just fork the repo?
 Let it languish?
  
My only attachment to it at this point is emotional. I'm sort of proud of the little thing.

 std::ifstream vertexShaderFile(vertexShaderFilePath); std::stringstream vertexShaderStream; vertexShaderStream << vertexShaderFile.rdbuf(); 
 This works correctly. However, I then need to pass a const char** to an OpenGL function, glShaderSource(...). I tried the following:
 glShaderSource(..., ..., &vertexShaderStream.str().c_str(), ...); 
 But this gives the following error: "expression must be an lvalue or a function designator". Why?
 Additionally, I tried the following:
 const char* vertexShaderSource = vertexShaderStream.str().c_str(); glShaderSource(..., ..., &vertexShaderSource, ...); 
 But then the first line gives this error: "The pointer is dangling because it points at a temporary instance which was destroyed." I'm not sure why this is either?
 I ended up with the following, is this the way it should be done?:
 std::ifstream vertexShaderFile(vertexShaderFilePath); std::stringstream vertexShaderStream; vertexShaderStream << vertexShaderFile.rdbuf(); vertexShaderFile.close(); std::string vertexShaderSourceString = vertexShaderStream.str(); const char* vertexShaderSource = vertexShaderSourceString.c_str(); // Create and compile vertex shader. unsigned int vertexShader = glCreateShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER); glShaderSource(vertexShader, 1, &vertexShaderSource, nullptr);

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy guys, I will be entering my uni for a CS degree within two months. I know the curriculum can give me some basic idea how things actually work. But I constantly hear that only a small amount of things which we learn in any CS degree is actually useful for job prospects. Companies really don't need stuff from an employee which is impractical and doesn't the do the actual job. People also say unis really don't teach the things which recruiters look for in a candidate to hand over him a job. Those skills are outside of the curriculum of uni and students need to learn those by themselves. So my question: What are these skills that I have to learn on my own to stand apart? I want to grasp them right at the beginning of my CS journey. Ofcourse I know that it depends upon the company a candidate will apply to but I think there must be some sort of standardization. Thanks for ur answers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am writing a small application (not library) which will have maybe five or six different source `.c` files. What I normally see recommended is for each `.c` to have a corresponding header file, with one of the justifications being that it makes it clearer to see the overall functionality / interface at a glance. I am wondering your opinions on having a single `.h` file for the whole project which is shared by each `.c` file (so all that each source file does is `#include "bigheader.h"`. I was reading K & R and they suggested this approach for small projects too. To me this seems good when each `.h` file will only have a few functions and thus the corresponding big header will not be very large. Also the project is small enough that compilation times won't be a factor.
 Note: I am not asking about single header libraries, which is what my google searches showed when asking about this topic.

 2021
 2022
 2023 
 As an update since the last post, there have been some improvements since the last one from early 2023: 
  
Plymouth's support for showing the boot logs is now merged, (and with the help of Ray Strode is better than it was when first shown in the 2023 post, as it supports console logs and some terminal sequence handling, not just showing /dev/kmsg lines). This means that Plymouth can show boot messages without the assistance of the VT console when the user presses ESC, instead of deactivating, and showing the VT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a way to be notified asynchronously (such as with a signal or by a syscall unblocking) when the outgoing send queue for a socket has been emptied? I would rather not poll it in a loop like I am doing currently:
 int remaining; do { usleep(100000); ioctl(socketfd, SIOCOUTQ, &remaining); } while (remaining > 0); 
 Solutions that require superuser privileges or inject any kind of hook into the kernel with something like ftrace won't work.
 Note that SIOCOUTQ returns the sum of the number of bytes that have not been sent and the number of bytes that have been sent but not ACKed, thus polling the file descriptor with select et al is not sufficient. See here.

 I've been learning Cpp for a little while now, and I want to import libraires and such. But I haven't been able to import and use anything so far... I downloaded the binaries for GLFW, copied the include folder into my CLion project's root folder. And then what? I'm supposed to link it, but HOW??? There's no help whatsoever, everyone on every tutorial just acts like it's already done and it's magic or you already OBVIOUSLY know how to do it. So far my CMakeLists.txt looks like that...
 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0) project(LearnOpenGL) set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 23) find_package(GLFW REQUIRED) add_executable(LearnOpenGL main.cpp) include_directories(./include) target_link_libraries("${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}" PRIVATE glfw) 
 Project structure is something like:
 Root |-- include | |-- GLFW | | |-- glfw3.h | | |-- glfwnative.h |-- CMakeLists.txt |-- main.cpp 
 I have no idea what I'm doing, can someone just help me 😭

 I would never admit that I'm leaving anyway, but in the event I get PIP'd, should I tell my manager that I'm OK with leaving without all the drama if I get severance? Or is it better to go through the motions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I've been recommended Arch Linux. I was shown how great it runs on a laptop that couldn't even run any up-to-date Windows OS good enough. Because of that I wanted to see how it is myself. I decided to dualboot Arch with Windows 11, it all went smoothly. For the past few days I've been experimenting with a lot of stuff on Arch and I love how it all works. The terminal is great, customization is great, community is great, and I just appreciate the fact that something like Arch exists. However I still end up using Windows 11 for the regular stuff I do. Playing games, watching stuff, communication and many other due to how a most of the stuff is designed with just or mostly Windows in mind. However as always, there are workarounds and alternatives for a lot of these things. Not all unfortunately and that's why I think I'll always have to have a dualboot even if I end up liking Arch so much that it could be my single OS because of some of the things that you can't really do on it.
 I don't really have any things that require me to have Arch Linux or just a Linux in particular, I feel alright with what I can get using Windows, but I also somehow feel like I'd want to use Linux (Arch in particular) and get familiar with it. See how I can use it and whether I'll enjoy it or not. I'm neither a full Linux beginner or experienced. 
 What do you think? Would it be a good idea to make Arch my main OS for a while and see how it goes? Try to transfer most of the stuff I do on Windows to Linux? Or should I just stay with Windows? Maybe find an old PC/Laptop and get Arch there? 
 I'm really sorry if this seems like a "stupid" question. I really ended up liking Arch and Linux as a whole and would like to learn more, I see how it is better but I just don't know what I should do with this due to the fact that I'm really used to and feel dependent on Windows.
 Thank you for your time.

Most people don’t make as much money as you think.
 CS is a new field, and because of that, changes rapidly. It’s the expectation that you keep up, and if you don’t like doing it, that will be exhausting.
 CS is boom or bust, and if you don’t like it, those bust years are going to be awful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know why, but excessive vertical spacing in code bothers me. As an example, let's say you have a simple add function:
 public int Add(int num1, int num2){
 return num1 + num 2;
 }
 To me, that's clean. What bugs me is something like this:
 public int Add(int num1, int num2){
 return num1 + num 2;
 }
 To me, it just doesn't look good, it's not clean, and it's a waste of vertical space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why does std::ranges::take(n) looks for the (n + 1)th element?
 I solve problems from Project Euler to improve my C++ skills, and wanted to solve problem 37 using the std::ranges library.
 My code looks something like this:
 bool is_truncatable_prime(const int n) { // Blah blah } int truncatable_primes() { const auto range = views::iota(10); // Goes on to infinity. const int total_num_of_truncatable_primes = 11; // Given. auto all_truncatable_primes = range | views::filter([] (int n) { return is_truncatable_prime(n); }) | views::take(total_num_of_truncatable_primes) | views::common; const int sum = accumulate(all_truncatable_primes.begin(), all_truncatable_primes.end(), 0); return sum; } 
 There exist exactly 11 numbers greater than 10 than satisfy is_truncatable_prime, all of which are computed immediately. The problem is std::ranges::take(n) looks for a twelfth element, which does not exist.
 Why is this like this, and is there a way to fix this?

 This is my class:
 public class Photo { public string Client { get; set; } = string.Empty; public int EmployeeId { get; set; } = -1; public string Sku { get; set; } = string.Empty; public string Filename { get; set; } = string.Empty; public int Position { get; set; } = 0; } 
 For some reason, Filename is not being deserialized and is always null. All other fields deserialize fine. I'm using System.Text.Json:
 public async static Task<bool> ProcessPhoto( Data.Models.Request Request ) { var photo = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Photo>( Request.Payload ); //... } 
 This is Request.Payload, which I've verified:
 {"Client":"Photos","Filename":"E10088_1.jpg","Sku":"E10088","EmployeeId":100,"Position":1}
 I'm aware I can use PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true in the options, but all the attributes and properties line up and it doesn't seem to me it should be necessary.
 Am I just missing something obvious?

 The problem is that one of the databases that's being used has over a hundred million records in it, and it's expected to grow beyond that rather significantly.
 I ask because this table is queried against another (using a join and some conditionals) and I'd like to do some of that on the C# side.
 I can't really think of a good data structure to achieve this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 i'm a software developer with a huge passion for retro gaming, especially the NES era. After months of work, I've just released my own NES emulator for iOS called Retroman.
 Loading games is straightforward: simply save legal NES ROM files (.nes) to your device using the iOS Files app, then open Retroman and select the game you want to play. Retroman also supports loading ROMs directly from other iOS apps using the 'Open In' feature.
 As a dev and a gamer, my goal was to create something that really captures the essence of playing on the original hardware. Some key features I focused on:
  
Smooth gameplay with minimal lag
 Gamepad support for that authentic feel
 iCloud sync for saved states
 Options to tweak video & audio settings
  
I'm really proud of how it turned out, especially the performance and the privacy aspects (no data tracking, everything stays on your device).
 You can download Retroman from the App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id6502994389
 I'd love to hear your feedback, thoughts and suggestions about Retroman and how it compares to other NES emulators you've used. Your feedback on its performance, features, and overall experience will be crucial in guiding future updates and improvement

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reading C#12 In a Nutshell and they say:
 class Bar<T> where T : Bar<T> { ... } 
 is legal in c#
 I understand generics pretty well but I can't wrap my mind around why this would even be useful. It means that whenever you have an object Bar, one of its fields maybe will have Bar or a subclass of Bar?
 Can someone make a (very simple PLEASE) minimal example? I feel like this would solidify my understanding of generics.

The D-Pointer is a weak pointer which can tell if the object has been destroyed or not. The problem is the public class which holds the instance of the private class is allocated on heap and needs to be managed separately. I have no other idea of how to implement the "game object" class.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven't yet come to grips with alignment. The example with structs is compelling and logical. 
 However, I am trying to determine if alignment is important for reading/writing strings.
 While many explanations like this make it sound like the problem is with memory, I however can't come to a different conclusion than CPU being the problem and memory just being memory.
 It may not even be related to memory alignment, but it sounds like reading and writing strings in int (natural processor size 32/64 bit) -sized chunks should be faster than doing it individually. 
 It would make sense that these optimizations were already part of either the system or their standard library wrapper functions. However, I need confirmation so I can know if I should make my own.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Advice to all my current CS majors now, if you are in classes please don’t use CoPilot or ChatGPT to write your assignments. You will learn nothing, and have no idea why things are working. Reading the answers versus thinking it through and implementing them will have a way different impacts on your learning. The amount of posts I see on this sub stating that “I’m cooked and don’t know how to program” are way too high. It’s definitely tempting knowing that the answer to my simple class assignment can be there in 5 seconds, but it will halt all your progress. Even googling the answer or going to stack overflow is a better option as the code provided will not be perfectly tailored to your question, therefore you will have to learn something. The issue is your assignment is generally a standalone and basic, but when you get a job likely you will not be working on a standalone project and more likely to be helping with legacy code. Knowing how to code will be soooo much more useful then trying to force a puzzle piece an AI thinks should work into your old production code base. The problem is you might get the puzzle piece to fit but if it brakes something you will have little to no idea how to fix it or explain it to your co-workers. Please take the time to learn the basics, your future self and future co-workers will thank you. 
 Side note : If you think AI is going to take over the world so what’s the point in learning this, please switch majors before you graduate. If you’re not planning to learn, you’re just wasting your own time and money.

 Hard to explain clearly in the title so let me try here:
 There's a function

 This function works great, unless a == b (the two pointers passed in point to the same address). In this case, the data at that address would be set to zero. Not ideal behavior.
 This swap_pixels() function is used to rotate what's effectively a 2D array of pixel data (laid out in a 1D array though).
 However, this function is used in only two places, and neither place ever passes in the same address:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're a company offering tenure-based PTO starting at two weeks and scaling up to four weeks after 15-20 years of service, you're only going to be hiring new graduates and middling experienced employees. You largely shut yourself off not only from the best employees, but also from the experience and lessons learned in the outside industry. Even if you hire high-quality entry-level employees and by some miracle several of them stick around for ten years, they're not going to be as productive as comparable employees with ten years of diverse work experience. And these policies which presumably are meant to retain employees are almost certainly only going to retain the lowest quality employees as the others can find gainful employment with dramatically better PTO (and almost invariably better pay) anywhere else in the industry. 
 This has been my experience when I worked for a tenure-based PTO company fresh out of school, and this is why I regard tenure-based PTO policies as a massive red flag when applying for jobs--even if I was willing to take a huge pay cut and a huge PTO cut to work on interesting problems, I can be reasonably certain that I'm going to be working in a sub-par environment with wildly outdated software development tools and practices under management that is actively fostering that environment.
 I'm curious what others think--am I way off base? Or does this align with your experiences?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all.
 I'm trying to write a wrapper around the FluentDataGrid component in Blazor where when I provide an IQueryable of any type it will parse out the properties of the Type and make a PropertyColumn for each property.
 A normal non-generic data grid looks something like this:
 <FluentDataGrid Id="yarngrid" Items="@yarnList.AsQueryable()" TGridItem=Yarn Virtualize="true" Style="height: 100%;" ResizableColumns="true">
 <ChildContent>
 <PropertyColumn Title="Name" Property="@(c => c!.Name)" Sortable="true" Align="Align.Start" />
 <PropertyColumn Title="Brand" Property="@(c => c!.Brand)" Sortable="true" Align="Align.Start" />
 <PropertyColumn Title="ColorName" Property="@(c => c!.ColorName)" Sortable="true" Align="Align.Start" />
 <PropertyColumn Title="ColorType" Property="@(c => c!.ColorType)" Sortable="true" Align="Align.Start" />
 <PropertyColumn Title="Material" Property="@(c => c!.Brand)" Sortable="true" Align="Align.Start" />
 <PropertyColumn Title="Weight" Property="@(c => c!.Weight)" Sortable="true" Align="Align.Start" />
 <PropertyColumn Title="Amount (Grams)" Property="@(c => c!.Amount.Grams)" Sortable="true" Align="Align.Start" />
 <PropertyColumn Title="Amount (Meters)" Property="@(c => c!.Amount.Meters)" Sortable="true" Align="Align.Start" />
 </ChildContent>
 </FluentDataGrid>
 I want to generate each property column programmatically by looking at the type of the IQueryable.
 I've wrapps a FluentDataGrid in a new component and I've added "@typeparam TItem' to the top of the razor page and set up a parameter of IQueryable<TItem> so that the Items can be passed in as a parameter.
 However, I can't figure out how to generate the PropertyColumn elements from the properties of the type. I've tried using reflection to GetType on TItem, but the compiler doesn't like that.
 Is what I want to do even possible?

When dividing two numbers you may or may not know if the result "type" will be an int or a float... or otherwise.
 But you must know the "type" if you wish to print the result using printf. 
 Example 1 may be some complicate math in the program...
 Example 2 may be taking keyboard input from a user
  
So, how do you handle this in C?
 A code example would also be nice :-)
 Thanks for any help.

malloc: *** error for object 0x16da830b0: pointer being freed was not allocated
  
From trial and error of commenting out lines and running the test class I can see its coming from the "first = &newLink;" line ("last = &newLink;" is basically the same thing so assume the underlying issue is there as well). Talking through the workflow, I'd expect:
 1. The default constructor to initialize the list with the pointer first as null.
 2. When addFirst is called with 23 the first time a instance of linkNode is created (newLink).
 3. first is then pointed to the memory address of newLink via the memory address operator &. 
 Any insight on what I'm overlooking? Thanks in advance!

 Let's say we have a function that says it will take in a const reference of some sort of list, like a string or vector, so it it promises not to modify it, but wants to make very small temporary changes to the list before using it for some function or process. Is that a valid reason to, in the name of efficiency and not needing to perform a bunch of string/vector/whatever copies, to sneakily use const_cast and then undo the temporary changes (so the user of the function would be none the wiser)? The code below is a simple example of what this could look like.
  
​
 int evaluate_string(const std::string& some_string) { // Return how many points this string is worth } int highest_modified_string_worth(const std::string& some_string) { int maxPoints = 0; for (const char& c : some_string) { char orig = c; const_cast<char&>(c) = 'A'; int points = evaluate_string(some_string); const_cast<char&>(c) = orig; maxPoints = std::max(maxPoints, points); } return maxPoints; }

I'm currently working at a startup with some absolute insane things going on behind the scenes. I've been in my current role for just under 2 years. My options paperwork is similarly 2 years late, my last two asks for raises have been declined, and the rest of my team has been laid off from under me. We were 5 engineers at one point, and for the last just over 6 months it's been just me keeping the lights on. 
 Currently, I make $105,000 living in the UK with just under 5 YoE. I've had an offer from another startup for around $150,000 which seems a lot more relaxed. I doubt there's a counteroffer in the chamber, and if there is, it raises serious questions about my recent asks being turned down. I'm ready to cut ties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always read that you should use auto in most cases and that's what I do. Microsoft, for example, says:
  
We recommend that you use the auto keyword for most situations—unless you really want a conversion—because it provides these benefits (...)
  
I have now a team mate that has a strong opinion against auto, and friends from other languages (java and c#) that don't have a very positive outlook on var. They aren't against it but would rather write the whole thing to make the code more readable. The 3 are seniors, just like me. 
 I just made a quick search and there seems to be some contention for this topic in C++ still. So I'd like to know where's the discussion at right now. Is using auto almost everywhere still a best practice or is there the need for nuance?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys! I'm learning cpp and I've come across a problem in which I need to return a pointer.
 I'm implementing sort of a prototype design pattern in which I have several concrete classes and each one inherits from a base prototype, and each concrete class has a method called getCopy() that returns a new copy of itself. 
 Let's say I have a container of prototype unique pointers, and I need to add several of these concrete classes to the container, should I return smart pointers for getCopy()? What is the best decision for this? And assuming I want the container to assume ownership of the pointers. 
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings fellow gophers.
 Around February or so of this year, we experienced a very sudden step change from two or three posts a week asking for resources about how to learn Go to two or three a day. Now I'm closing 5-10 questions a day with a link to the New to Go pinned post.
 I appreciate those of you who try to answer such questions, but if you are one of those people, could I ask you instead to take a quick scan over the New to Go post and answering there instead of in one of the half-a-dozen daily posts on the topic? That will default to sorting by New.
 It helps me to be able to send people to the New to Go post with a straight face if their questions are indeed answered there.
 So if you're one of the people who has book recommendations, or opinions about web frameworks, or an idea for an open source project a new Go developer can contribute to, or any of the other questions we're seeing multiple times a day, please perhaps even copy & paste one of your recent answers into that thread.
 I would just ask that you look for a top-level thread to put it under that matches the question if possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve seen so many posts with constant worries about AI and I finally had a moment of clarity last night after doomscrolling for the millionth time. Now listen, I’m a novice programmer, and I could be 100% wrong. But from my understanding, AI is just a tool that’s misrepresented by the media (except for the multiple instances with crude/pornographic/demeaning AI photos) because no one else understands the concepts of AI except for those who use it in programming. 
 I was like you, scared shitless that AI was gonna take over all the tech jobs in the field and I’d be stuck in customer service the rest of my life. But now I could give two fucks about AI except for the photo shit. 
 All tech jobs require human touch, and AI lacks that very thing. AI still has to be checked constantly and run and tested by real, live humans to make sure it’s doing its job correctly. So rest easy, AI’s not gonna take anyone’s jobs. It’s just another tool that helps us out. It’s not like in the movies where there will be a robot/AI uprising. And even if there is, there’s always ways to debug it. 
 Thanks for coming to my TEDTalk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm 4 YOE software engineer and thinking about looking for my next job soon. Some advice I've heard when describing your experience, is to answer the question "So what?" after you describe what you've accomplished. "I worked on C# API." "Okay, so what?". I just feel like I have nothing under my belt that I can answer "so what?" with any real non-bullshit answer (Being measurable, etc). I've kinda been a ticket monkey for a lot of my job, and I'm currently working on a team that is life-supporting some shit before its sunsetted, so not the most dynamic and opportunity filled position. Any initiative I've taken has been on less technical stuff like trying to improve documentation. 
 How do I escape the ticket monkey trap?

 I want to return two values from a function. Therefore I use std::pair to pack them together.
 In order to assign the return value to a variable, I use std::tie like this:
 int nValue1, nValue2; std::tie(nValue1, nValue2) = function();
 However this is in conflict with RAII principle.
 Is there a possibility to initialise both values with a single function call?

It took me six years to finish my bachelor’s in computer engineering. It has been a very tough experience. After going through depression, dropout, and countless nightmares, I’m glad that I eventually made it out after six years. I’ll be starting a new job this August making 6 figures and living in a new city. 
 Looking back, I never actually believed that I would eventually graduate and find a job. I have been struggling academically since my freshman year, but things eventually worked out for me. College is hard, but do believe that life will eventually become better. If you are still struggling, remember that if I can do it, you can do it too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 I am Mantas, one of two developers at LazyFlock, at the beginning of June we launched Steam page for our coop horror game with puppies called “Haunted Paws”. In less than two weeks our game reached over 100k wishlists and I wanted to share what steps we took to make that happen.
 TLDR:
  
Our previous game projects failed.
 We shared our early game with puppies idea on TikTok, and it went viral.
 After the first successful TikTok (>1m views) we created mailing list while we worked on the trailer and Steam page.
 After our social media success, we contacted the press, but unfortunately, it didn't work out.
 OTK reached out to us to participate in their game expo, which helped us to gather 20K wishlists after the first day of announcement.
 We launched Haunted Paws and our gam…]]></summary>

 This is a scientific field that’s made multiple antibiotic-level breakthroughs in the past half century. No class is going to teach you everything. You can’t learn everything. But at the same time, you can’t stop learning, or you’re gonna be left behind. 
 I feel people have the attitude that programming is only a step above clerical work. It’s closer to working in an R&D lab. It’s hard. It’s frustrating. But nobody expects you to synthesize a new form of viagra your first day on the job as a chemist. Keep going, and maybe you’ll be the one to discover a way to put stuff together in a way that will change everything.

 Here's what I usually tell people, when they ask me, how we decide if we should write tests for something (in reality, this is not a discussion or long drawn process, but a X seconds decision):

 I am a Game Programming student, almost finished my 3rd year, but I'm not happy with my set of skills. I try to do some at-home programming very rarely, but never finish any personal projects, or get to a point where it starts to look like a game. Nowadays, all the programming I do is the stuff I need for school, and that is done by clenching my teeth and trying to get my anxiety under control. 
 I do think I enjoy programming, it's fun when I know what I'm doing, or there's some sort of system already that I am building on top of. But when it comes to starting something new, creating the base structures for a game or a project can be very tedious. And I definitely …]]></summary>

The problem here is trying to test this method is currently looking very difficult because this is a sealed class with a private constructor. The only way you get an instance is by calling a method on an instance of HttpListener. This is supposed to represent an http request context. 
 I am trying to test logic in a method that takes this in . I don’t know how to do this since I can’t even inherit it or create an instance directly. And there is no way I want to start a server in the test project . If you have had to deal with this before or know any techniques to this please share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came from golang as a strictly back end engineer. Usually, I write the business rules & behaviors like transformation, validation, conversion, etc in the models/domain/entity layer.
 But, lately I've been assigned for the fullstack MVC project using C# .NET. Here, I'm not really sure where I should write it. Is it a standard practice too to write it on the models layer?
 There's also no "service" layers in the project. There's only controllers, models, & views. Writing a bunch of small function in the controllers look like a code smell to me, and I'm looking for an advice.
 To get you some ideas, this is the function that I need:
  
Validation (check if the value in the object is valid to process)
 
Convert object to dictionary
 
Replace placeholders with the actual values (obtained from the object)
 
Combine several strings as single string (like email to, email cc, email bcc in an object as a single string)
 
Transform or generate string in an object into another string (by using replace & regex)
 
etc

 As you know, when the std::vector can not accommodate elements using its current storage capacity, it allocates a new space and moves the elements to the new location. 
 And if you trace the events happening during that operation you will notice for every object in the container is moved using "move ctor" and old ones are destructed. 
 My question is, why does this happen that way? In my opinion, the old space can be moved to a new location using bulk memory copy methods (like memcpy) faster. 
 One may say about reference invalidation, but it is also the case for both methods.

 It wasn't made from following a tutorial, but I did watch a random tutorial about authentication, where I've also learned about controllers, views, and overall a lot from it.
 Though I'm not new to programming, I've been doing game dev in Unity and app dev in WPF for the last 2 years, and game dev in Unreal Engine for my first 3 years.
 This is the fastest I've ever learned a new skill.
 I did learn html css and js a year ago, and now I was mostly remembering it, but never made a website before. never touched asp.net before.
 I still struggle a lot with js, but with html and css is mostly just remembering syntax.
 The backend was pretty easy to make, It felt really familiar from Wpf. The front end also felt familiar but still new enough to make me struggle, especially with the js part.
 The most amount of time was spent on frontend. Especially in the beginning when I was remembering stuff, and then I also had problems with adding sounds.
 There is a lot more to learn, of course, so if I ever get a new website idea I'll come back to web dev and keep learning, until then I'm going back to working on my multiplayer game. :))

 One time, I worked at a place that thought keys in a database were unnecessary, and that OOP was just a fad.
 Multiple times, I've worked at a place where you could drop the entire database with SQL injection from the login page.
 One time, I was on a team that was so dysfunctional, a "talking stick" approach had to be used during meetings. In the 4 months I was on that contract, over half of the team (5/9) just quit without notice.
 One time, I had to ask my manager on a monday to ask her manager to ask her manager to ask the client contact to ask the manger there to ask their development manager to ask their DB team lead to ask their developer, "The API is unstable... can you get me a link to the stable version?". Two weeks and 80 billable hours of me doing literally fucking nothing later... "Here ya go!"
 Contracting/Consulting man... fuuuuuuuuck.
 What do y'all have to share?

 C++ is so, so much more than high frequency trading.
 Is it reasonable to ask for some official rules or guidelines that discourage these kinds of posts?
 I know we already have the /r/cscareers (or whatever spelling) subreddit. If that's the designated place for these questions, can users report posts about HFT careers questions to get them removed and redirected to the cscareers subreddit by mods?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a project involving the Walabot, a device typically used for detecting structures within walls. My application, however, is a bit more complex—I create and stitch together heatmaps of objects through various materials using the Walabot. The original version of the device would tether over USB and didn't require any fancy interfacing. 
 The newer, wireless model of Walabot I’m using generates its own Wi-Fi access point named "Walabot_40XXXXX2," but it's secured with a WPA2 Personal password, the app starts and finds said network and after a second or two begins to communicate and stream data the Walabot.
 The support team has been unclear or unable to understand my request, telling me its's "not open source" when asking for the WPA2 password. My thought is that it might unfortunately be using some type of rolling WPA code or that its generated per connection by making requests against some kind of backend.
 My first thought had been to try and intercept the communication with a wifi bridge running on a raspberry pi between the Walabot and the Phone with a pair of the RTL8821AU USB adapters I have and hopefully capture the password being transmitted, but I can't authenticate so that doesn't seem the workable.
 I know I am overthinking this, any software or hardware recommendations that could simplify this process?

It's currently single threaded but I am changing it to be multithreaded, haven't done multithreading before planning to use a thread pool. Each thread will push all BFS children in queue once it's done traversing 1 dir.
 My question is, should I have a scheduler thread which will take each task from the queue and wake a sleeping thread and make it execute the task after which the thread sleeps and scheduler revokes it.
 OR
 Shall each thread be responsible from picking a task by itself from the queue, once done executing check the queue and pick again or sleep if queue is empty.
 I belive these methods are called Master-slave(centralized scheduler) & producer-consumer(self managed thread) pattern? do let me know if I am correct, thanks.
 PS:- It's a similar utility to linux find, i don't think the order of execution should matter here

 Somehow the root user shell became set as zsh even though this wasn't installed anymore. I fixed this by the following:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If we’re actually being so “agile” and using the whole feedback loop the system is designed for, then why is it such a big deal to have constant deadlines and an even bigger issue when an arbitrary deadline set by management is missed? It doesn’t seem like it should be an issue if the sprint goal is missed when there are unforeseen problems or work needed to be done. Isn’t that kinda the whole point, to be able to adapt on the fly and work incrementally? 
 Obviously this shouldn’t always happen, but it’s not necessarily the developer’s fault if it does either. Usually I think it’s a failure of leadership more than anything if the work can’t be done smoothly for whatever reasons. Tech debt, lack of documentation, no ownership of codebases, etc. All this planning and all these tools seem to be underutilized and more just a way of managers keeping tabs on progress as work gets completed. And so that they can put a hard stop on a “project” even though there almost never truly is, but they want to be able to put their stamp on a successful project. 
 Instead of using all these great tools that allow for asynchronous teamwork and should increase productivity, we all sit in hours of meetings every day with way too many people where 90% of them have no reason to be there. And we’re all working across different time zones so it’s never easy to get something scheduled. I really think if there are more than 5 or so people on a call at one time it’s a complete waste of time and most people are just there for show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read people online saying that working at Amazon can be a bad/toxic experience. Meaning that managers place extreme demands on developers, requiring them to have large workloads on tight deadlines, work extra hours, be on call, etc.
 How true is the bad reputation? Does anyone currently work (or has worked) at Amazon in a software role that can provide their experience?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. First, I would like to apologize. I'm not good with English, so I've been using translation tools and GPT to search for information, but I'm struggling to find what I need. I need your help.
 I'm looking for a collection of practical C# functions. For example, functions for measuring time, checking if a number is an integer, splitting strings, managing CSV files, etc.
  
Is there a specific term for this collection of functions? For example, something like "Helper"...
 Are there any popular GitHub repositories that contain such collections of functions?
  
It seems like creating all these functions from scratch would take a lot of time, so I'm looking to find them already made.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a somewhat short day of work I finished around 4 pm with the last meeting of the day. So I decided to install Arch again on my system after realizing a tool necessary for my work (VPN) couldn't be installed on the newest version of Ubuntu (24.04 as of today) because of a bug, so I got to it.
 Normally I use a guy's tutorial but I felt a bit smart*ss today so I tried the archwiki way. I got pretty well for the most part but after installing the bootloader it wouldn't boot. Then I tried to work my way around it by using my most valuable IT skill, google. And a bit of the arch wiki.
 I managed to solve a few things but apparently I couldn't configure correctly the bootloader. So I gave up and watched the guy's well detailed video and skipped to the bootloader section. Now I have another working Arch install on my house (I have a laptop with arch) and my girlfriend, who was watching youtube videos all the time, was just begging for me to stop.
 All this because I just hate Windows.
 Tl;dr just the title and some problems with systemd's bootloader

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm very new to programming, and something I've found to be kind of unintuitive during the last application I wrote was the order of declaring functions. From what I understand, a function needs to be declared before being called, so everything in main needs to be declared before main can be declared.
 My question is whether there are any recommended styles or guidelines to how I should go about ordering functions in my code. Should I go last to be called first, first to be called last? I've also noticed you can declare all functions at the beginning and then have the functions in whatever order. Is there any benefit to doing this, and then for example declaring them in order of when then they're called in main (this way seems most readable to me as a beginner, but I'd prefer to use a style that's common).

 It's a very straightforward architecture, clean code, and it works well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been looking on LinkedIn(I know, there are better places to find stuff) at some SWE/DS Intern postings and they’re very intimidating to me. Even the ones posted less than a day ago have more than 100 applicants. When I go over to actual SWE/DS jobs on my feed, there is an actual number I can look at(e.g. the applicant list is under 100 rows long). 
 This in combination with some of the crazy shit I’ve been seeing with these 3-4 round, 4-5 Medium-Hard LeetCode problem(Some of which have 10-15 minute time limits when asked together) interview processes just scares the hell out of me. It seems like a full time job recruiting process without the full time part. 
 I’m coming here to ask: is everyone who applies to internships an actually qualified candidate, or are some just throwing shit on the wall and trying to see what sticks? I guess what I mean to say is that I don’t think everyone single person applying is beyond a college freshman, and has a decent GPA, prior experience, and technical interview experience. I would think that there are still those in the early 2020s mindset, who simply show up to class and expect to get paid by some tech company for putting in the bare minimum to earn a degree. Or maybe I’m wrong, and most people who apply truly are aware of what it takes and are actually qualified.

 I was wondering what ya'll think the most boring parts of development & building a project that can be that are so repetitive and mundane and should be handled by an AI agents, have a SaaS to make it easier. To me I hated UI and API testing (having to find or create my own test cases or find test images if it uses visuals)
 What would yall think about an AI API platform that helps you generate APIs from natural language, automated testing (we create test data based off your api whether its input images or text), we create a frontend based on your API/backend so you can try it on a UI level. Would these things I mentioned be helpful and a good usecase of GenAI? Think of it as Postman with GenAI
 Would love to hear about your challenges with APIs that AI could help with or any other issue in dev that you face where AI could be helpful.
 I'm looking for a project to better the lives of developers or QA when it comes to things that are unnecessary mundane.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I graduated in May of 2023 with a SE degree and a 16 month internship I did between my 3rd and 4th year under my belt. I took a break after school during the summer which lasted until winter, where I built one large project and other smaller ones.
 I quickly realized when I started to apply in January that jobs are not easy to come by, as all of you are well aware. I've submitted around 250-300 applications now and have yet to find a single interview. I had one phone screening that went well thanks to a referral, but unfortunately they filled the role the day after my screening so I didn't progress.
 I'm struggling to find a single interview. It's a numbers game (my resume has been iterated and I can't find ways to significantly improve it. Again, showcases education, experience, projects, and is consistent/formatted. the typical stuff. Could certainly be improved though I'm sure since I'm stuck getting interviews, but I don't know what significant stuff I can add in the meanwhile)
 The problem I'm having is figuring out what to do in the inbetween. I have no idea when I'll get a job. It might be a year, maybe two years. It's not out of the question with how dead this hunt has been. I'm working on projects on the side which have been better now more than ever, but it's not enough. I feel as though I'm wasting precious moments.
 I'm considering a masters, purely to put something on my resume as it's been a year since I graduated, and the gap only grows with time. Unfortunately, I missed the target application date for this term, so the earliest I can start is January 2025 for only a few programs.
 Does anyone have any tips on things to do in the inbetween to ease the mental stress of the clock ticking away?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a little over 6 years out of college, rose through the ranks at my company and became a lead software engineering making a really good salary. I’m definitely not complaining but it’s always in the back of my head that this company could go under or something else that would result in my job being lost. 
 It wasn’t that long ago that we laid off a decent amount of employees and it’s just had me thinking. I don’t think I’d be able to find a company that treats me as well and pays me as much as this one. 
 Is it normal to feel a little trapped? I don’t want to leave or anything like that, but even if I did want to, I don’t think I would because finding something comparable would be near impossible. Similarly, does anyone have experience taking pay cuts when moving jobs? Obviously if my company ceased to exist or I got laid off, I’d be ok with a pay cut, but is a pay cut ever really worth it if it’s your choice to leave?

 I've got about 5 years of experience in industry (about half low-level C stuff, the other half "full stack" web dev, but in practice mostly backend). My last job initially involved a lot of different kinds of work, but ended up turning into one of those legacy maintenance quagmire gigs with very specific skills that are not easily applicable to other positions. So overall I feel like I'm kind of upper-junior to intermediate, as far as my experience and skill level goes.
 I got sick of my dead-end last job and that, combined with personal things that I had to deal with at the time, led me to quit 3 years ago. Then, 2 years ago, I started developing a game just for kicks, and as it started really taking shape I realized I could probably monetize it if …]]></summary>

 I'm struggling to come up with a new name that captures the essence of the game and feels unique and pleasant to say. I'm trying my luck here to see what ideas you might have.
 Think freely. The wand in the game could be referred to as a rod, stick, or any other similar word, and it doesn't even need to be in the title. The protagonist is currently a fox, but I am considering changing it to another animal like a squirrel, mouse, or even a crocodile.
 I enjoy clever wordplay and have been toying with "Wandventure," but I'm not confident in my English skills to decide if it works. So, give me your thoughts. All suggestions are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[webc is a C library that allows the user to write websites using the C programming language.
 It's following the Jetpack Compose philosophy of using Modifiers to alter and share the appearance and functionality of each component (element), while also encouraging code re-usability
 The library is composed of 4 modules.
  
Core: Handles the building of the page
 Server: The HTTP server to serve the generated, or virtual site (has some issues)
 Actions: Handles the cli arguments of the executable
 UI: Ready to use UI components (Soon)
  
The pitch for this library is that you can have a single executable with almost no dependencies that will be responsible to create and run your website. You can also use anything that C has to offer while writing your site. It can also be used in IoT programming to write the static sites that are served from an esp32 for example
 DISCLAIMER: The library is in early stages of development
 Feel free to check it out and tell me your opinion!

I ran out of time, and moved to the next problem which was a follow-up on the first. I tried really hard to write something and even tried to explain my approach to the problem, but no working code came out at the time. I let the interviewer know that this isn’t something that would be part of the day of a DevOps person and he even agreed but 🤷🏻‍♂️ I’m super sad now because I was really looking forward to work with these folks and I left the call with the feeling that I did horribly bad. That’s it, sorry. I just needed to vent :(

 So, I debugged the whole thing only to notice some weird behavior. for loop control variable key correctly gets assigned with the first value abc in necessaryKeys. However, in all further iterations, it gets assigned with empty string (""). Thus the variable someVar inside for loop's body never gets assigned with the value some_config_key. This results in configuration[someVar]["ConfigurationFilePath"].as<std::string>() to fail, probably because there is no YAML node associated with configuration[someVar] (that is, configuration[""]) and hence configuration[someVar]["ConfigurationFilePath"] is probably NULL. This seem to force as<std::string>() to throw bad conversion error.
 The error gets thrown from this line in yaml-cpp library:
 if (node.Type() != NodeType::Scalar) throw TypedBadConversion<std::string>(node.Mark()); 
 The node.Type() is YAML::NodeType::Undefined in debug session.
 Why key is getting assigned with empty string second iteration onwards? Or my C++ noob brain misunderstanding whats happening here?

The issue is, if I explicitly do this for every error check, my function is a mile long, if I nest everything in something like if (!error) , my function is a mile wide.
 One idea would be to just throw a cleanup: section in there with if (error) free(whatever);, then if an error comes up, goto cleanup , but I've seen lots of apprehension about using goto in general and I'm fairly new to C so I'm not just gonna ignore all that, I understand goto can be extremely confusing and broken if used incorrectly. So I'm curious, what would you normally do in this situation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a static library that implements Singly Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Trees and Graphs in C. I mainly based it off this brilliant video on Data Structures. Even though I didn’t really implement any algorithms (I’m not smart enough for that yet), it still taught me a lot about coding and Computer Science in general.
 This was my first big multi file project in C and thus any feedback regarding things like code, best practices, etc. are welcome and would be greatly appreciated. 
 This project also showed me the pain of build systems in C. Trying to learn and use make probably took me around 2 hours of fidgeting around with the code and banging my head against wall trying to get it to work. Still, as you’ll probably see, my make file is a mess and I would appreciate any feedback regarding it.
 The GitHub Repo: https://github.com/Antasma-X/DataStructLib
 I don’t plan on coming back to this for a while but I still had a lot of fun making this project.

Most of my Linux time has been spent on Pop!_OS where I started, but over the past 3 months I started distro-hopping: Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu (I still run Ubuntu on my gaming PC because it's easy and I don't have to think too hard), and now Arch. 
 Today I finally managed to get Arch set up correctly and thought I would share my experience (re: mistakes). I see a lot of newcomers in this sub, like me, and thought it might be helpful to see what it's like on the other side from someone who only just reached the shore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I have found out something weird that I don't understand with header files and forward class definition.
 So I have 2 classes called Class_1 and Class_2 in 2 header files called shit_1.hpp and shit_2.hpp. I also have source files but nevermind them. Class_1 has a member Class_2 object, and Class_2 has a member Class_1 object. Now if I do a forward declaration of Class_2 before Class_1 definition, I have an incomplete type error, which is expected. So I change the attribute to a pointer to Class_2. However, if I do a forward declaration if Class_1 before Class_2, I get no errors and the code compiles. Why is it an error in one file but not the other? Is it just that the compiler went through Class_1 first so when it got to Class_2, Class_2 was complete? It does seem to go through the files in alphabetical order, since switching the content of the files still gives an error on the same file, but this is a bit weird. 
 If someone can tell me what's happening, I would greatly appreciate it. Here are the files if the text wasn't clear enough.
 shit_1.hpp : 
 #pragma once class Class_1; class Class_2 { public: void f(Class_1 obj); private: Class_1 object_; //compiler error at this line }; 
 shit_2.hpp :
 #pragma once class Class_2; class Class_1 { public: void f(Class_2 obj); private: Class_2 object_; //no compiler error at this line }; 
 both source files include shit_1.hpp and shit_2.hpp 
 Thanks!

        <updated>2024-06-25T18:09:58.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction:
  
I'm working over an Arduino+ESP32 project and thus I'm restricted to C++14 which lacks C99-style designated initializer (like my_struct_type_t thing = {.speed = 10, .weight = 5}).
 I have a function that takes around 6 values as parameters. In order to follow best practices (at least as I know them) I'm going to create a struct instance and pass it by pointer.
 Older initialization style (like my_struct_t type thing = {10, 5}) works OK, but it's order-dependent. To some degree it works against the purpose of creating and a passing a struct instead of passing a set of independent variables.
  
I have an idea of a following workaround:
 void cmd_handler_set_WiFi_SSID(char *cmd, bool *refresh_flag) { // My struct type. static set_config_params_t params; // Flag. static bool was_called = 0; if (!was_called) { // All 6 necessary values are written using struct members' names. params.cmd = cmd; params.addr = INBUILT_STORAGE_ADDR_WIFI_SSID; params.decimal_only = ANY_CHAR; params.topic = "SSID changed successfully! New SSID is: "; params.echo_val = ECHO_VAL_ON; params.refresh_flag = refresh_flag; was_called = 1; } // An auxiliary function that needs aforementioned 6 values. cmd_aux_set_config(&params); } 
 The idea is that if I ever need to customize my struct type, I won't break anything if I change the order of its members. Code fragility is therefore reduced.
 Does it look OK? Nothing silly or overengineered?
 UPD: struct type is
 typedef struct set_config_params_t { char *cmd; uint32_t addr; bool decimal_only; const char *topic; bool echo_val; bool *refresh_flag; } set_config_params_t;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. Last 4 years I am working in telecom, with C++. Will be joining as backend dev, in 1 month. Please suggest some resources to learn C#. I tried some youtube and coursera videos. Those were too basic, like explaining the basics of if and for loop etc.
 I know the basics of programming already. Need some way, preferably book, to quickly pick up C#. Any suggestions welcome. Thanks!

 Hey folks, in the above code block, I've allocated 5 bytes to `name`. This code works without any errors. Technically speaking, should not I allocate 6 bytes (name[6]), because of the null terminator?
 Why didn't my compiler raise an error? Are compilers are capable of handling these things?

Likewise, InterceptsLocation must be used for the .Net 8 interceptor. However, additionally, we need to say line and column in that, making me think that it is not the same as Autofac.

 The last straw was how difficult it was to parse a bunch of command-line options (standard GNU/Linux form, with both long and short option names, most long options having a one-letter short alternate), and using a config file for fallback defaults for options not specified on the command line. Pretty basic stuff. I have done it in both Java and Python and it is basic in both. So it should be pretty basic in Go.
 It should be, but it’s not. First, Go’s standard library flag package does not support an option having both short and long forms. It’s hard to believe (this has been a de-facto standard in the GNU/Linux world for decades now), …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm nearly 40 years old. I've taken the advice of many to go back to university for a CS degree. I work full time and will only be able to dedicate one class a semester. I've been told from professors and others that the time dedicated to schooling will not give me the practical skills necessary to get a job out of school. 
 Maybe a normal college aged person can afford that and will lesrn on the job, but someone in my position, can I afford spending 5 to 6 years in university while working full time just for mostly theory? Is it worth it? 
 Edit: Thanks to everyone for taking the time for insightful comments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel the more I hear about Agile, the more I hear it associated with negative experiences. Even for myself I have actually kind of grown a bit of a distain for agile. Whenever I go to interviews and ask about Agile and they say “yes we’re big on scrum” I almost whence. And it feels like my experiences aren’t unique. I’m constantly hearing how people just dislike it.
 Now we all know the story. x and y aren’t doing real Agile. Or “scrum is the problem, not Agile”. Or “they are bastardizing scrum”.
 I would say I’ve seen Agile work very well. But here is the secret. It only works on fantastic teams. However I think good teams are good with or without Agile. 
 And that’s why I think Agile could be dying. Because sure under the perfect circumstances, Agile works good. But isn’t the promise of Agile to fix broken processes or teams. If I can’t apply Agile to one of the worst teams, and it doesn’t make it better. Then what is Agile actually doing. The reality is that bad teams will never do true Agile or true scrum. And nothing about Agile prevents extreme bastardization of its ideas. 
 So what are your opinions? Have you seen Agile work well? Do you think there is a way to save Agile. If so what does that look like?

After work I am super exhausted and cant stand to look at any more code let alone apply to hundreds of jobs. I am wondering if its possible to get away with just personal projects when it comes to interviews instead of grinding out leetcode? I am not looking to get into big tech, I really don't care about that shit. I just want something that pays a respectable salary.

 Lets say you have downloaded a game developed with Unity from steam, you don't know what version it is made with. You are the first modder. What is the next step?
 If there is a guide or something you can link I would appraciate it.

During the discussion with HR, I asked if the salary would be adjusted after my 6-month probation period. HR told me honestly that there was a low chance since most employees receive increases after their first year in the company.
 During my probationary period, I gave my best effort. Every quarter, I received the Process Champion Award and People's Choice Award. I was also recognized as Rookie of the Year, which was challenging as many others were deserving of the award.
 After 6 months, exactly on January 2, 2024, I received notice from HR congratulating me on my regularization and explaining the benefits, such as entitlement to paid vacation and sick leave. As expected, there was no salary adjustment. I wasn't expecting …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the embedded world, we often manipulate physical units (volt, ampere, seconds, milliseconds, etc). I'd like to create a small library to help me avoid making mistakes (like adding seconds to milliseconds).
 My first thought was to use struct to leverage C's type system
 typedef struct { float s; } Second_t; typedef struct { float ms; } Millisecond_t; 
 And maybe using _Generic to create basic operator functions like add, div and gte.
 This API is a bit awkward; I'm afraid. 
 Do you have any advice on how to implement physical units?
 Or more generally what would you recommend to make type safe containers in C?

 Project Requirements:
  
Performance: The application needs to run smoothly on low-end hardware without excessive resource usage.
 API Integration: Core functionality revolves around interacting with APIs to dynamically fetch and display data.
 Cross-Platform: It must support both Windows (Windows 7 and above) and potentially macOS.

 I already has basic knowledge in programming in general (for example, I developed interpreter in Rust from scratch), 
 I know basic data structures (hash-tables, graph, linked list, gap buffer, piece table, rope) and can implement them in C, but dont know any algorithms at all (including sorting and searching). 
 I am also interested in developing low-level stuff (idk how to describe else) like desktop apps, maybe os's related stuff.
 You may also wonder why I chose C over Rust, that's because I like C more than Rust.
 I would be very grateful and appreciate any help!

 I'm new to C# and trying to learn a little bit. So, I created a starter template for those who can't install anything on their work computers. 
 What it does: - Uses the pre-installed csc.exe and msbuild.exe (found in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\) - Works with VS Code but doesn't need it - Has a build.bat for command-line users
 Why I made it: I couldn't install Visual Studio or .NET SDK at work, so I created this template as a solution. It's simple, but it's a practical way to do the job!
 GitHub link: CSharpMSBuildVSCode-Starter
 I'd love to get your thoughts: 1. What could I improve? 2. Do you happen to know if this is useful, or am I reinventing the wheel? 3. Are there any cool features I should add?
 Thanks for checking it out! I'm looking forward to any feedback, good or bad.

But it popped out as a new window, which I promptly tried to drag into the main window and place it as a tab. some other things happened around me and I clicked something by mistake, and the xaml was gone.
 I've tried to rebuiled and a number of other silly pannicky things like close the solution etc.. which long story resulted in applicationinfo.cs also gone.
 The actual UI of the window is still there, so the xaml must be somewhere, U just don't know where.
 I should add that this not such a big deal, it's a throw away test project where I was getting to know styles and templates through trial and error. There is no urgency to my request.
 Which is. How can I fix this?

 I have been writing C++ for 7 years now and I love it. As of now i have done a few larger projects (by my standards): - chess engine with uci interface (c++) - lisp interpreter (c++) - chip8 emulator (c++ and rust) - malloc, realloc and free (c) - paralell gravity simulation that runs smoothly with ~500k particles (c++)
 I like to code stuff thats low level and/or computationally intense.
 I‘m searching for a new challenge, but when I ask ChatGPT (or just google) its usually just stuff like: - crud app - messenger app - banking system - calculator etc
 What projects have you done that helped you to push your skills?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, I've been doing the CD part in this traditional way: deploy the chart using Helm and combine the values either from files such as values-dev.yaml, values-prod.yaml etc. These files contained the secret and non secret data, the non secret data are just empty strings and they get "injected" during the pipeline run from the secret libraries such as Azure Pipelines Library. 
 Pods have defined env vars or volumes and I inject the values into these from the values files using Helm syntax. 
 I am now looking to migrate this towards the GitOps world, so once again I will have the Helm chart defined in the repo, but this time I will be deploying it using ArgoCD installed on my k8 cluster where the Hem chart is also going to be deployed. 
 But I am now confused, how do I handle the secret values such as connection strings etc. which were before residing in the Azure Pipelines Library which was a part of pipeline. I can still use the files such as values-dev,yaml etc. because I can define them inside the ArgoCD CRD Application, but I can't inject the secret values into them anymore.
 Am I doing this wrong, do I need to totally change the approach and ditch this way of using value files and secret data injection.? If yes, what would be the correct GitOps approach then?

Doesn't matter which language but when I see like a whole project written in Ruby or JavaScript sometimes I feel overwhelmed like I have to go over everything and make sure I understand it bit by bit and sometimes I won't understand the syntax completely, so the process of just understanding what the project is, is lengthy and a headache sometimes. I'm sort of new to programming and I've been doing a lot of work with Ruby and JavaScript and I often feel like this. Does it get easier? As in, you can look at the code and understand it super quick and figure out what you missed or what you need to fix etc. Or is this a common problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been working for a database company for the last 6 years and I have "ownership" of a major product in this company (I actually posted here recently and the full details are here). In a nutshell, I inherited a legacy backup and recovery system and replaced most of this code with a proper and elegant solution.
 There is one component in the machinery that is responsible for synchronizing a specific type of data. Think something like a system table in a relational database. I never got around to replacing this part of the code because I would likely break the whole company (literally) - so I pushed hard to build up some sort of collaborative effort between the other teams to replace this but this effort never went anywhere because "if it ain't broken, don't fix it." This has been going on for years now.
 I desperately warned them that this needed to be replaced. Why? Many of the algorithms in the code are running in quadratic time because the code was written "quick and dirty" to launch the product in the early days. Fine. And most of our clients are also running low-GB sized deployments as well so there's no real perceivable delay in backing up data (think a few minutes tops).
 However, two of our clients which pay more than all the other clients combined, recently decided to set up a backup and recovery system. These clients have A LOT of data and the projected sync time for this data is looking for 3 months to a year per sync cycle. It's already been several months on one client and that client's C-suite has essentially reached out and said that this is unacceptable.
 Now all fingers are pointed at me, and well, I've been saying that this would happen. The thing is that I don't want to burn bridges or "be that guy" but there isn't exactly an immediate solution to this problem when the code is already out in the wild... at least not an easy solution
 Has anyone else experienced this? Tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, as a college student, my college has taught me Basics of CPP like variables, loops, functions and OOPs. They only touched basics of STL and I haven't done it. I come from Python background and want to shift to C++.
 So, I learned about this site www.learncpp.com from this sub, and decided to try it. They have a very vast field of topics and in depth.
 Basically, my problem is I have "holes" in my theoretical knowledge, if that makes sense. I think most of them are towards OOPS concepts and I don't know anything from STL.
 Due to this, whenever I start learning it from scratch, I feel like I already have done the concepts. So, I would like to know how to approach the site and will it be favourable for me?

 I chose "True" for this question, but the correct answer was "False", so I got it wrong. Why is "False" the correct answer? I thought that O(n log n) grew slower than O(n²).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 Bitwarden has an SDK here: https://github.com/bitwarden/sdk.
 But it's written in Rust with bindings for other languages. I'm not dissing Rust here, but if you have a pure Go project, in order to use the SDK you will have to introduce CGO into your project to build and use the depending libraries.
 That is inconvenient at best at worst, you will have to drop support for certain architectures that you otherwise would.
 Not to mention an increase of ~130MB to your built image. That is more than inconvenient if you pride yourself on a slick image size.
 Because of that, External Secrets introduced a pull-through REST based API server that is deployed via helm and uses HTTPS to communicate with the main external-secrets service. It comes bundled together with external-secrets' helm chart, but it can also be installed separately.
 It provides TILT file for easy development and a way to quickly generate a certificate ESO can use for secure communication.
 It's in alpha at the moment, but I'm not planning on changing the REST API anymore. ( Unless there is really a good case for it. ).
 Here is the link https://github.com/external-secrets/bitwarden-sdk-server.
 And once this PR is merged external-secrets will support Bitwarden Secrets Manager.
 Thank you for the support and reading this! Happy secreting.
 Skarlso.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All. I am building a finite state machine. My idea is to define a 'std::function' type that returns another 'std::function' that takes the same set of parameters as it (ie; function A takes parameters a,b,c, and can return any other function that takes parameters a,b,c). To that end I've declared the following type alias;
 using GroupingFSMFunc = std::function<GroupingFSMFunc(char c, TokenList& token_list, std::string& working_string)>; 
 Later on I have declared this function:
 GroupingFSMFunc groupingFSM_Default(char c, TokenList& token_list, std::string& working_string) { // Some other stuff. return groupingFSM_Default; } 
 I'm getting two particular errors at the moment
  
`function groupingFSM_Default returns incomplete type GroupingFSMFunc`
 `cannot convert to incomplete class std::__1::function<<error-type>>`
  
I have checked thoroughly and all required headers are included, and all types are fully defined. So my guess as to this error is that the return type of the std::function is the same as the name of the alias. Upon review I can understand how this would be a problem. So my question is, what is the correct way to declare a function type that returns a function with the same parameters as it?

It has a 5 stage pipeline that includes interrupts, pipeline flushes, 1-BHT, and all the typical bells and whistles. I used C to take simple NASM assembly files and convert them into machine code. The CPU emulator would then take the machine code, convert it back to NASM (mainly for readability and debugging purposes), and then execute the instructions.
 From the research I've been doing it appears that making a GBC emulator would be better to start with than a GBA emulator. I'm good to go as far as determination, skill level, and time. It's mainly going to be a learning opportunity and portfolio piece. 
 What would the perceived level of difficulty be compared to what I’ve already done? Let's say a scale of 0 - 10. 
 Thank you in advanced!

 KDE Plasma requires qdbus but Arch forces those unused dev tools like Qt Creator, Designer, Assistant, Linguist... as required dependencies.
 K3b requires cdrdao app to write CDs, but you can't install it without that junk app called GNOME CD Master.
  
Other distros like Ubuntu seems to take time to split packages to keep their installation clean, while Arch Linux which promotes being clean seems to do the opposite. 
 Or is there another truth why Arch maintainers throw the whole unwanted apps as required dependencies for others?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Relevant to me specifically. I challenged myself recently to complete a vertical slice within 1 week. I was able to do really well with just 1 week of work, but during that time I got 0 physical exercise and basically ate almost no food.
 I have a fear that if I don't go all-in, my games will never be good enough. But my opinion is that my relaxed best is going to have to be good enough, because I could literally cause myself to die if I try what I did over the past week again a few more times. If my game isn't good enough, I have to be OK with that. And I have to be OK with other people thinking my games are shit (in the ever-fluctuating comparisons). Because maybe they'll always be shit, no matter how much work I put in, and I only have one life to live, so I can't spend it trying to be something that I may never actually be able to achieve.

 This thing has Bluetooth, USB, Wi-Fi, but no serial port. 
 Does anyone know how I could interface this with a computer without paying thousands of dollars for their proprietary software that's really only intended for use in hospitals. 
 I don't really know where to begin, I know if there was a serial port I could probably use an open source serial port monitor to translate the info but I'm not sure what to do without one. 
 Ideally we want to be able to track trends, but also we would like it to alert us through a computer or mobile device because it could literally be a life or death situation if we don't hear it from the other room.

For the first four months, there was a lot of work and I was learning something new every day (I came from the SWE area), but for the last three weeks I've had almost nothing to do and there's no sign of any optimistic scenario.
 Is it normal in this area (DevOps, Cloud) to have so much downtime? When should I worry? Sometimes I think they've hired wrong: there's no backlog and my leaders ask me to refactor SQL queries because they have no idea what else to ask for. I don't mind doing it, but I confess that it bores me and I feel like I'm stagnating.

 I came from arch and they had it in their official repos, and I had heard that debian generally has more packages available by default than arch.
 I dont mean to hate on debian, but I am just curious if there is a reason.

 You might also have noticed P3294R0 ("Code Injection with Token Sequences", a significant update of which, P3294R1, is expected soon) in the pre-St. Louis mailing: I recently added an implementation of capabilities described in that paper and that has been available on Compiler Explorer since earlier this month.
 I updated some notes about the EDG demo on Compiler Explorer and made them available at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bTYIwQ46l1shwM_9mdnpRnvn6Y4o6oxmY_sn74ooTc0/edit?usp=sharing in the hope that it will make it easier for interested parties to explore the P3294 proposal.
 (Consteval blocks — as proposed in P3289 — is also implemented in that version.)

IMO, the existence of null pointers in a memory safe language is contrary to its purpose. What if all uninitialized objects had a default value of empty instead of null? There would be no memory allocation until it was explicitly defined. All interactions with the uninitialized object would behave as if the object were empty and did not fire Null Pointer Exceptions.
 Attack!

 I cannot for the life of me figure out how to do this correctly. I need to return some sort of iterable object that doesn't let you alter the underlying data structure. The underlying structure may hold non-const Pin * though, which is causing me trouble.
 I tried returning a const vector<const Pin *> & but you can't cast the underlying vector to change the type parameter to const Pin *.
 I tried returning a span<const Pin *> which as I understand it, should be constructable from a vector or directly from the begin/end iterators, but the compiler didn't like that for some reason.
 I tried ranges and views but I don't quite understand the semantics, let alone if they're meant for this use case. Plus visual studio seems to not recognize the headers.
 I can probably figure out how to use any of these, but I'm not even sure what the right approach is, so that's my main question.

Now i am capable of reading a pkgbuild (not sure about how to manually check that shasums correspond) but i do not know if it could be the best way to download a browser. If I didn't need for uni i would have sticked with firefox or brave but for a while i need chorme. My concerns are about potential malware injected on aur repo. I trust and love arch community but browsers are just so sensible that i feel unsafe in using an unofficial package...
 In the past i used aur packages kinda shady (poor mantainance, lack of upvotes etc) but now that i'm studying cybersec i became paranoid...
 EDIT: unfortunately google has disabled chrome sync on pure chromium since 2021 as i know, i believe it has not been re-implemented. I DON'T like chrome nor google policies but i need it's sync for my university account, that's linked to google

 I would like to better understand what is happening here.
 Here is a minimal example:
 #include <vector> #include <complex> int main() { std::vector<double> source = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; std::vector<std::complex<double>> output; for (int i = 0; i < source.size() - 1; ++i) output.emplace_back(source[i], source[++i]); for (int k = 0; k < output.size(); ++k) std::cout << "output[" << k << "] = " << output[k] << std::endl; } 
 Producing this output:
 output[0] = (1,1) output[1] = (3,3) output[2] = (5,5) output[3] = (7,7) output[4] = (9,9)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I would like some guidance on how to proceed when creating/using an equivalent to Module Bundler for C++.
 Look, I know that this doesn't have great functionality in the context of C++, as it has the linker and preprocessor in the compilers that will do most of the equivalent process and in a much better way.
 I'm an undergraduate, using the language, I realised that most of the required activities are based on the same snippets of code, which, with a little effort, I managed to generalise, I created a library for that.
 I managed to configure the whole environment, create unit tests and so on, but the format of the activities does not allow me to send the compiled code, nor to use a library I created. Each activity accepts only one source file, which contains everything that needs to be implemented, except the precompiled header files from the standard C++ library.
 In this way, an equivalent to a module bundler in C++ would be very useful to organise dependencies in a priority way, so that declarations come before uses, with the standard library include directives at the top of the file. 
 I am not here to ask for an explanation of how the language works. I'm using Python to create this "module bundler", I've made a lot of progress, but... I'm stagnating, I don't know what tools to use to interact with the C++ files without reinventing the wheel.
 It's worth noting that I organised the library into two directories: 
  
include, which contains the header files;
 
src, which contains the implementations;
 
 If you have any suggestions, I'm open to them.
 In any case, thanks for your attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently started pursuing a higher education in a technical university. It's all good untill I was faced with C programming. It seems impossible to learn. No matter what guides I watch or how much time I spend trying to figure out a solution I just can't understand it and eventually end up asking chat gpt for solution. And it's not like I'm stupid. I have no problems solving triple integrals.
 My question is: how do I go about learning C. How do I start solving given tasks by myself? It seems like I'm just given a task and there is very little guidance provided by my teachers

I've done very little configuration: passwords, timezone, hostname, screensaver timeout. I left it up over night, with Chromium running and a couple of Youtube tabs, not playing, paused. 
 This morning I tried to play a youtube video and it was very sluggish, not playing at all. I suspected network problems, so I pinged my router (just fine), then AT&T's router (also fine), then "ping youtube.com". Nothing. CCtrl-C doesn't kill it. In another xterm I ran top, and it shows sadc at the top of the list, 100% CPU.
 man sadc tells me that it's System Activity Data Collector. Doesn't sound like something CPU intensive.
 I'm an old Unix guy, but this is all new to me. Anyone got a clue to offer me?

 I have a line up that NPCs can join. The line up "asks" all NPCs in a certain radius if they want to join the line. If multiple NPCs want to join the line, they must not all say yes at the same time. If two NPCs say yes to join the line at the same time, there is a deadlock in my code
 I want it to be like this:
 Ask all NPCs in radius if they want to join line
 Collect their answers of "yes", but only admit one at a time. Meaning, two NPCs will not walk towards the line at the same time
 Do I do this:
  
Ask all NPCs in radius if they want to join line
 
Iterate over them randomly and those that say "yes" - put them in a queue
 
Let them in one by one by popping the queue every x seconds

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am quite young (15M), but I started playing with code when I was 7. Since then, I have tried many things, but what interested me the most were, of course, video games. So, I started with Scratch at 7, trying to learn the basic coding mindset. Then, I began working in Unity where I used C#. It took me some time, but eventually, I got the hang of it and finally felt confident enough to participate in a few game jams, where I created simple games based on a theme all alone within a time limit.
 A few months back, I wanted to explore more programming and decided to try something other than just Unity. So, I searched the net and found out that you can make basic console applications using .NET. It was a little weird getting used to a slightly different style of coding compared to working with Unity, but it was fine after a few days.
 After making basic things like calculators, turn-based combat, dice throws, tic-tac-toe, and shape calculators, I found that I had no idea where to continue and where I should go next. After watching some videos online, I wanted to try LeetCode, where I realized I have a shallow knowledge of data structures and algorithms.
 So, my question is, should I continue doing LeetCode problems and try to learn as much as I can, or should I make some other projects? If so, do you have any ideas or directions?
 Thanks for reading. I would appreciate it if you could leave your opinion. I am quite confused and feel like there is a better way to learn other than grinding LeetCode.
 Thanks again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sure "Protagonist Syndrome" has some other meaning but for my case here, the definition I'm giving it is: Since the player is in control of the character, the player's actions should effect the ending of the game. This goes for games that really don't need multiple endings.
 Recently, while brainstorming ideas for games, I keep spiraling down this hole that has the same rocky bottom: I think the game(s) should have multiple endings depending on the player's actions. Of course, in some cases, this could be fun and add some replayabilty. However, I don't want every one of my games to be like this. It's nice to have a single playthrough that ties everything in a nice little package. I think my issue is that my brain convinces me that the player's actions should have a meaningful impact on the story because the player controls the very thing that is experiencing the story: the character.
 In other mediums, I feel this is much easier to avoid. When you watch a show, you are witnessing the events happen to the characters in the show. However, in games, those events happen to you, the player. 
 Does any body else feel this while brainstorming ideas? If so, how do you work around this? I would love to hear what everyone thinks!

 Say your working hours are 9-5 how often are you working before or after that time as requested by the company due to doing work which can only be completed when there are less customers using the platform?
 I'm getting frustrated because it seems to be increasing and I value my time outside of work but I also understand what industry we are in.
 Please let me know if there is a better subreddit for this question.

 I’m just getting into CS. So this isn’t a snarky post about “it’s so easy, just do it, blah blah blah.” I’m genuinely curious. I’ve seen a lot of people here talking about being unemployed, laid off, or just not being able to find work.
 What’s going on? Any insight? Makes me concerned about starting grad school for CS.
 Edit: Why is this getting downvoted lol
 Edit 2: Why are some people being such a-holes about a post asking a simple question?

 So, logically, array layout consist of
 SyncBlockIdx -> VMT pointer -> Int32 global length, i.e. count of all elements in all dimensions -> Ind32 length of each dimension -> and null terminator might be here, to signal that there is no other dimensions -> and here we got actual elements of array -> and here might be null terminator as well, to show end of array, which would be stupid, because we have length of everything.
 The question is: if arrays have null terminators, where is it?

 For my tests I created a primitive version of a relatively simple data structure I once created for a sudoku solver (it was a project at uni):
 https://github.com/claudemartin/smallset/tree/valhalla
 It's a bit field that uses all 32 bits of an int. That means it can hold the values 0 to 31 (inclusive). "SmallSet" isn't a great name, but it is a set and it is "small" because it is limited to only 32 bits. 
 Here are my opinions:
  
It's relatively easy to use. You really can just use the new keyword "primitive" to make any class primitive.
 It is stable. I tried the same with Java 14 Valhalla and back then it crashed when I let it run the uni…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been abstracting my vulkan renderer for a while now when I ran into the issue that my program would continuously crash. Using debuggers (lldb, gdb, valgrind, sanitizers, etc.), I figured out there were two places my crashes were happening at: vkCreateGraphicsPipelines, and also vkAcquireNextImageKHR (whenever I tried to create a pipeline, or render a frame). The code for the pipeline creator is here as well as a disassembly (provided by lldb), just in case that might be helpful for debugging. As you can see, I'm passing through two structs called vk_device and vk_swapchain as well, which are my attempts at abstracting and organizing my renderer even more. They're not relevant to my problem, but if you want to check the code out for that they're here, just in case I missed something important there. Static analyzers also flag my shader loader, so in case there's something going on there the code for that is here. The reason I load the shaders twice is to get the size of the shaders, create a buffer, and then read the contents into that buffer. That's probably also filled with bugs so if there's any feedback on that let me know. And the code for the frame renderer is here, along with the output of running valgrind on the program, as well as with sanitizers. Those are just snippets of the program however, and I may be completely wrong about where the errors are or you may just want to try it out for yourself, so the link to the complete project is here, (I tried to upload to github but after 3 hours of trying i just gave up and made a dropbox).

The thing is, I’m using a Chromebook, and more specifically online editors, and I’m yet to find one that can handle this 20mb input file I’m meant to use… what can I do? Any online compiler that works well with big inputs? Any compiler I can try to install and run on my Chromebook?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I'm pretty new to C++, and so far the thing that's making my experience absolutely miserable is prototypes and functions.
 -need to make sure the arguments are identical
 -need to remember to add the class name to the function definition
 -change one of them? Need to remember to go and change the other
 Dealing with things like static functions makes it even worse.
 In Java, I would get excited whenever I came up with an idea for a new utility class since it meant there was about to be a simpler and more satisfying way to do some tedious task. In C++, I just find myself dreading having to deal with this headache and asking if the class is really necessary.
 My point with all of this: is there some kind of shortcut, addon, etc that automatically generates the prototypes for you and syncs existing prototypes to existing definitions so you can change both at once? I'm using Visual Studio (though I'm not particularly attached to it; that's just what was suggested by my classes).
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know SharpDX has been abandoned but it still seems to work well enough to use over Graphics.CopyFromScreen from a speed perspective.
 My issue at the moment is optimising for speed and was hoping that grabbing just the middle section instead of the whole desktop will shave off some time.
  DataBox mapSource = device.ImmediateContext.MapSubresource(resourceTexture, 0, MapMode.Read, MapFlags.None); System.Drawing.Bitmap outputImage = new System.Drawing.Bitmap(desktopWidth, desktopHeight, PixelFormat.Format32bppRgb); System.Drawing.Rectangle rect = new System.Drawing.Rectangle(0, 0, desktopWidth, desktopHeight); BitmapData mapDest = outputImage.LockBits(rect, ImageLockMode.WriteOnly, outputImage.PixelFormat); IntPtr sourcePtr = mapSource.DataPointer; IntPtr destPtr = mapDest.Scan0; for (int y = 0; y < desktopHeight; y++) { if (y > 620 && y < 820) Utilities.CopyMemory(destPtr, sourcePtr, desktopWidth * 4); sourcePtr = IntPtr.Add(sourcePtr, mapSource.RowPitch); destPtr = IntPtr.Add(destPtr, mapDest.Stride); } outputImage.UnlockBits(mapDest); device.ImmediateContext.UnmapSubresource(resourceTexture, 0); 
 Is there a way to actually just grab the section of the desktop I'm interested in?
 As a simple hack I've resorted to grabbing the whole screen but only doing <CopyMemory> between certain rows and whilst this still results in a bitmap with the desktop dimensions, it does shave off some time. If its only possible to grab the full desktop then how would I go about also only copying certain columns like I am doing with the rows?

However, I know a lot of people who form groups with seniors and experts in them and solve OQ questions together, a few of them even frown that they'll have someone else give OA for them. 
 Almost everybody is doing that now days and some of them even get internships after doing this. Is it me who's in the wrong of putting efforts myself? Even talking to friends about feeling bad about not passing an OA just means them mocking me for trying to give it myself when everyone else including themselves are 'cheating'. Am I really missing out?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have 10 years of software engineering experience, I've worked in both startups and large corporate companies but I've had very little system design experience. I'm full stack so I've done web (React), backend (Java, messaging) and devOps (AWS), and I'm far from being an expert at any of them.
 In all the projects I haved worked on, I learn the ins and outs of the whole distributed system, and have made improvements on them. What I haven't done is design a system from the ground up (in a professional setting anyway).
 My feedback on interviews are normally "for a senior, you should really know this" which knocks my confidence down quite a bit.
 I currently work full time and I don't want to spend hours and hours studying this topic especially if it's only used for interviews. Is there a quick way of learning this just so I can pass these type of interviews? Or am I just not senior?
 Perhaps I should compile a cheat sheet on some of the most common system design techniques?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introducing C++ Include Helper for VS Code
 Hey C++ enthusiasts,
 I've noticed that despite the vast array of extensions available for Visual Studio Code, there hasn't been a tool specifically designed to automatically handle #include directives for C++ header files. To fill this gap, I developed the C++ Include Helper extension.
 This extension scans your project for class definitions and provides autocompletion for class names as you type. When you select a class from the suggestions, it automatically inserts the necessary #include directive at the top of your file. No more manual typing or hunting down the right headers!
 Key Features: - Automatic Workspace Analysis: Scans your workspace for class names and keeps them updated. - Smart Autocompletion: Provides class name suggestions and adds the corresponding #include to the top of your file. - Manual Trigger Option: You can manually refresh the class mappings at any time.
 I would love for you all to try it out and share your feedback!
 Check out the extension: - GitHub Repository - VS Code Marketplace
 Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or report issues. Let's make coding in C++ on VS Code even better together!
 Happy coding!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on Advent of Code 2023, day 5, part 2.
 I've written the algorithm such that it spins up N number of goroutines with each getting ~1/N of the total work.
 Below are the benchmark results:
 ``` BenchmarkPart2_1-12 1 158815433816 ns/op // 1 goroutine
 BenchmarkPart2_2-12 1 88549455038 ns/op // 2 goroutines
 BenchmarkPart2_3-12 1 63186500356 ns/op // etc...
 BenchmarkPart2_4-12 1 46691500431 ns/op
 BenchmarkPart2_5-12 1 39155689537 ns/op
 BenchmarkPart2_6-12 1 34629445753 ns/op
 BenchmarkPart2_7-12 1 36447557849 ns/op
 BenchmarkPart2_8-12 1 35244527553 ns/op
 BenchmarkPart2_9-12 1 33227748920 ns/op
 BenchmarkPart2_10-12 1 30762895445 ns/op
 BenchmarkPart2_11-12 1 34484875596 ns/op
 BenchmarkPart2_12-12 1 32437991650 ns/op ```
 I have an i7 8700K, and running runtime.NumCPU() returns 12.
 I was expecting a linear decrease in run time from N=1 to N=12, but the results for N=11 and N=12 were surprising.
 I reran N=10 and N=12 and got similar results:  BenchmarkPart2_10-12 1 29811332966 ns/op BenchmarkPart2_12-12 1 32785340748 ns/op 
 How do you explain the runtime behavior?

 For some context, I was moved to a new team in December to work on some AI initiatives. I was moved alongside a junior developer on my team. We were engineers 1 and 2 on this new AI initiatives team. The tech stack was very familiar for me; working on a Kotlin code base using Spring Boot, and AWS.
 However, it was not the same for my junior. My junior is a self-taught software engineer with 1 YoE as a front-end engineer at another company. She was only at our company for a month before she was moved over. She had to learn a lot of back-end technologies and infrastructure in this 6-7 time span.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to call two docker commands from an application and I would like to pass the commands from the Process' StandardInput so I don't have to start two processes. So far I've tried this:
 public static async Task ExecuteProcess() { var workDir = "/someDir"; using (Process p = new Process()) { ProcessStartInfo info = new() { FileName = "bash", WorkingDirectory = workDir, RedirectStandardInput = true, RedirectStandardError = true, RedirectStandardOutput = true, UseShellExecute = false }; p.StartInfo = info; p.Start(); await p.StandardInput.WriteLineAsync("docker compose pull"); string? output; while (!p.StandardError.EndOfStream) { output = await p.StandardError.ReadLineAsync(); Console.WriteLine(output); } await p.StandardInput.WriteLineAsync("compose up -d"); while (!p.StandardError.EndOfStream) { output = await p.StandardError.ReadLineAsync(); Console.WriteLine(output); } } } 
 But when I execute this, the program gets stuck waiting indefinitely after the docker compose pull is executed.
 The reason I'm calling bash instead of docker in Process is because since I'm passing the arguments to the process from StandardInput, if I call docker directly, Process will start a docker process with no arguments until it reads them from StandardInput, so it outputs the message about how to properly call the docker command. So by calling bash I start a bash shell and then I provide the docker commands through StandardInput. But what I think is happening is that once the first command executes, bash does not detect that the first command completed/returned successfully.
 I know I can set the Arguments property in Process, and execute the first command, and then change Arguments to the second command and call p.Start(); again, but that would spawn two processes and I'm trying to avoid that.
 Is there any way to do this without having to call Process twice?

What the heck is LINQ? it came up a couple times along with "IEnumerable" when i was learning about lists. looking this up led me to a huge rabbit hole that i can't quite make sense of (mostly due to me not understanding a lot of the terminology used as they were in the explanations. I was able to get a grasp on what enumerables are but LINQ still eludes me.
 Could i get more clarification on interfaces? I haven't used much OOP since starting (because my first couple programs are understandably small and oop seems like it would unnecessarily complicate things) but they seem kind of like abstract classes to me (funny enough i haven't really made an application where i would need to use abstract classes either, but after looking them up they seem pretty straightforward) and im not sure when i would use which.
  
please excuse my ignorance haha, still getting the hang of it all

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[iterative*
 Hey guys, my head is exploding trying to figure out how to implement a simple bfs function, with the following desired usage:
 int next_idx = start_idx; struct bfs state = {0}; while (next_idx = bfs(nodes, next_idx, &state) > -1) { nodes[next_idx] = blah, blah... } 
 Here's what I have thus far:
 struct bfs { int queue[NODES_MAX]; int queue_head; int queue_tail; int visited[NODES_MAX]; }; static int bfs(node_t (*nodes)[NODES_MAX], int node_idx, struct bfs *state) { state->visited[node_idx] = 1; // mark as visited state->queue[state->queue_tail++] = node_idx; // add to back of queue while (state->queue_head != state->queue_tail) { node_idx = state->queue[state->queue_head++]; // pop from front of queue // action/predicate: printf("%d ", node_idx); // iterate adjacent [some quirky impl. details, nvm too much] for (int i = PROPS_LINK_1; i < LINKS_MAX; i++) { int adj = (*nodes)[node_idx][i]; if (adj > -1 && adj < NODES_MAX) { if (state->visited[adj] == 0) { state->visited[adj] = 1; // mark as visited state->queue[state->queue_tail++] = adj; // add to back of queue } } } } } 
 This obviously doesn't work the desired way. I just can't seem to wrap my slow head around how to structure this to get the desired usage. Maybe someone here could help me out...

 Why this crap cant die ? Its not maintained for over 10 years, most plugins are CVE10s, ppl moved on, cloud native is already 5-10 years old.
 If that deprecation goes as fast as now my grandchildren will be still (dear god pls no) still required to maintain that sh*t.
 What the fk fk stops you ppl from migrating off of that pile of smoking hot crap?
 And who tf starts a company in 2020 using Jenkins for CICD? Havent you learnt anything in like past 20 years?

 Every time you post a job offer and list you use Jenkins a kitten dies of cancer. I like kittens, please stop killing them.
 Ps. For the ppl who say Jenkins is free, look at your hosting costs, maintenance costs and innovation blocking costs. That last one hits the most. New Java pops up? Shit your jenkins does not support it :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, sorry for the shameless plug, but I put together a tool made with go y'all might find neat. The general gist is:
 qq is a interoperable configuration format transcoder with jq querying ability powered by gojq. qq is multi modal, and can be used as a replacement for jq or be interacted with via a repl with autocomplete and realtime rendering preview for building queries.
 It supports transcoding between json, xml, yaml, hcl (tf), toml, csv and ini (perhaps more to come, HTML and proto at least among many bug fixes) with leveraging jq as a filter in-between. There are quite a few encodings bundled in so be warned there is undoubtedly some uncovered edge-cases this early in its release.
 The package as an importable component does have some generic use for marshalling and unmarshalling between formats with a standardized interface.

 Would this purely be a negative trait of the game and should I just make it purely in English, or could you see yourself finding the concept interesting?

 I'm struggling to hack my lab on AD. I attempt to get a first hash in an environnement with a Domain Controler and a few machines. Keep in mind that I have no access to the target, then I can't reboot ot, or call a shared file, or anything else. And there is nobody working since it's a lab. I want to get the hash with no "human" action from the target.
 Please what do you advice ? MITM6 ? anything else ?
 I was wondering if scans as Nessus and Nmap would simulate some traffic from those particular ports, since it works like a handshake, the answers would generate something ?
 For example an SMB scan, would give some data back to the attacker and generate a hash ?
 And what y'all think about launching mitm6, ntlmrelayx, and responder at the same time ?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just as the title says. What are some opinions about development you use to believe strongly in, but have changed over the years. What has changed them? Was it any new experiences? 
 A few of mine are below:
  
I don't really care for DRY anymore. 10 years ago, I tried to make my code as DRY as possible, but now I don't mind repetition
 This changed due to moving to writing Go professionally. I started to notice that making Go DRY felt like a code smell. I will create an abstraction if I understand the code enough. But I use to be obsessed with this.
 
I don't think dynamic languages are that great on the backend. I use to think it was only performance, but lack of a type system is a big problem. I use to try to make Python and Ruby code work in the backend. You can certainly write code faster in those languages, but they feel like liabilities.
 
Memory safety maybe isn't that great anymore. As a Go dev who use to be a Java dev. All I know are JVMs. But I've found garbage collection gets in the way, and optimizing or building around the GC is quite a pain. It requires very specialized knowledge of the language, and learning how to save allocations. In Go's case it can lead to some very unreadable code. And in Java you have to really learn how to tune the JVM. I also think Rust borrow checker and lifetime semantics actually creates a lot of complexity.
 
 And that's it. Any development experience for you that has changed over the years?

They would go to top-tier ML conferences and conduct ML interviews and have reading groups but their actual role was nothing ML-related at all. For myself I was working on maintaining DB clusters the whole time - I asked to do ML work but they wouldn't let me (I don't think there was any for me to do). The team I was on did nothing ML-related but had "AI" in its name. It felt like a big LARP. Fortunately I eventually moved on to a better place but I'm curious how normal this is. Is AI just a giant bubble with a bunch of people just pretending they're doing it?

 I am wanting to integrate a database into my project. I did this once in another project using SQLite but I want to integrate a DB service like Dynamo DB, Cosmos DB, or FireBase.... youtube has not been a help and neither has google. 
 Ive read that Dynamo DB doesn't work well with .NET Maui and me being a beginner makes it kinda hard to read all the different documentation while understanding everything clearly. 
 If anyone has a good resource or advice on where to look, id appreciate it a bunch!

I’m a devops guy so I write software and also deploy it to prod and operate it. If I want to deliver software officially then I have to click through an awful ITSM tool with ninety’s flair for more than an hour. My solution: deliver a base image once. Mount config PVC in container under /config. Rsync new software code to /config. If someone asks then we only do config changes. I still need create a change request for config change in the shitty tool but creating an IT change request only takes me 3 minutes. I’m the only approver of the change request.
 I hope this story could make you smile.

 I am not a computer scientist, or developer, or software engineer, or any of that. I come from the world of mathematics and data science (where I learned a fair bit of python). I have always wanted to dive into the world of C++, because it is the first language I wrote "Hello, World!" in. And somehow it secured a special place in my heart after seeing those words appear in the terminal.
 As you can probably infer from the question, I took that dive. I began reading a few pages of the C++ Primer and Learn C++ by example each day. I did this for a long time.

 What is the reasoning behind this concept (passing a struct)? How passing a struct by value(s) is different from passing multiple variables by values? Maybe proper way to pass multiple values is passing a struct by address?

 Old school strategies--multiple hosts with mirrors of monolithic applications, hiding behind a load balancer.
 Using suites of bespoke shell scripts to automate away toil and monitor system health.
 Ancient security approaches--isolating all the things, not having any unnecessary utilities, libraries, etc. on the hosts, IP whitelists, tight MAC policies, logs galore...
 I'm familiar with major cloud platforms like GCP, AWS and Azure. I've setup PIM, synced on-premise LDAP directories to the Azure AD, created Backblaze buckets to rclone encrypted backups to, deployed SIEMs like Splunk, set up log forwarding, setup firewall policies, spun up VMs, created Docker containers, managed DNS...
 I've used Ansible, Puppet, stored configuration files in git repos.
 I can't get an entry-level DevOps job. I'm stuck working short-term contracts for staffing companies, maintaining ancient monolithic C applications at large universities and performing user access audits for $35/hr.

Right now, I heavily use python for coding. But some say C++ is also needed in AI development like for creating libraries, or for fast performance etc. But when I search courses and tutorials for AI in C++, there's almost none of them teach about it. I feel I have to learn using C++ especially if I try to create custom library for future project, but I don't know where to start. I already learn C++ itself but that's it. I don't have any project that use C++ except in game development. Probably I search the wrong topics and probably I should have not search "AI in C++ tutorials" and should have search for something else C++ related that could benefit in AI projects. What should I learn about C++ that could benefit for AI project and do you know the tutorials or maybe the books?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just finished an Engineering University course on C and C++, this course being my first interaction with both of these languages and, more importantly, recursion and linked lists. For context, we had a course on Python during our first year, but it was mostly the basic concepts that were introduced in that class.
 During one of the lab assignments, we were asked to write code for a bunch of functions that work recursively, as well as some linked list-related stuff. I got very good results in my previous labs (always one or two points away from 100%, if not 100% outright), but for this lab I got six whole marks deducted for code that worked perfectly fine. 
 I know it works because I tested it thoroughly and had multiple problems with my previous solutions to the problems, and because the entire concept of recursion is new to me, I had some rather unconventional solutions for those. 
 The question I have is, is it fair/normal/standard for professors and TAs to grade so harshly when the code is simply "unoptimized" to their eyes? There are NO compilation or runtime errors in any of the cases, and even though some things are not implemented in the best way, they do not create any memory leaks, dangling pointers or break general convention from what I was able to understand by taking this class. 
 If anyone wants/needs screenshots of the code and the feedback I got from it to better understand what I'm asking, I can post those as well.

 2) regular sieve with wheel factoring: 2.27 seconds
 3) segmented sieve: 0.93 seconds
 4) segmented sieve with wheel factoring: 1.07 seconds
 The segmented sieve with wheel factoring should be the fastest but it's not and I can't figure out why. Compiler explorer is too complicated here. I can't make sense of it. If I comment out the if statement on line 321 then the function runs a little more than twice as fast. It seems to be ruining the cache locality somehow but I can't work out more than that. Any help?

 What do I have:
  
A strong CS background, while I don't have a degree (I dropped out of 2nd year in uni due to health reasons) I self-learned computer science from the best books and online courses from the best unis and solved a lot of complex problems
 proficient in Rust and its ecosystem
 beginner in .NET C#, I switched from Rust to .NET because I was unable to find openings in Rust, I'm now applying to C# positions or positions that do not require a specific stack in the posting
  
What I don't have:
  
a degree
 a nice portfolio, I planned to start building one after finishing my CS studies but I had to find a job to support myself and it's taking most of my time which slowed me down significantly (I'm still working on the projects but they won't be ready anytime soon)
  
I honestly don't know what the recruiters saw in me, my GitHub has only one Rust project, a CS curriculum that I created and followed (800 stars), and an unfinished advent of code last year's solutions.
 help me turn this mess into something sellable, I really want to work in this field, I studied hard for the past couple of years and I wish to see that work pays off

I basically know the base syntax, i can write like a quicksort, and do basic in- and output, but i don't know when to use which type of int, and what constexpt is for ,or volatile, and i am really confused.
 Can you help me with a bit of advice?

 Background: I have a big nasty tuple, but all the types are distinct types so it's simple to pull out what you want. But I still need to return the whole tuple, when a caller might just want a few pieces of it. I want to make it very easy to just return the useful pieces, ideally destructured without needing the call site to work with a tuple at all.
 Currently I have something that works with pairs/tuples and raw types, but it needs to be a bit more explicit for tie if I want to get more than one thing out, destructured:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why is the 'override' keyword forbidden in function definitions, when specified in the function declaration? From my perspective, when examining an implementation, I would like to know if a given function is overridden and the presence of this keyword would help (rather than adding a comment).
 Repeating 'override' in the definition of a function would of course be redundant for the compiler, but it is useful information for the human reading the code. I mean, it should be required in the declaration but optional in the definition.
 After all, some other keywords are treated differently, e.g'noexcept' is both required in the declaration and defintion.

 I'm a CS student during my 2nd year. 
 I'm trying to find the specialization I like the most so I wanted to hear your opinion :) 
 I'm actually interested in infrastructure and software development. I want my job to be interesting so i can balance organization, code, and cooperating with other team members. 
 I was thinking about DevOps which is a blend of that stuff, currently, I'm learning AWS cloud and I already have the RHCSA that gave me a Linux background. 
 On the other hand, i was thinking about backend and C programming. (I'm not interested in frontend at all) 
 C programming (mainly about embedded?) I'm not interested in game development, what are the options for a C developer out there? I don't have any electronics background, so getting into the field will probably be tough. However, I seem to like the low-level stuff, but not the crazy math stuff. 
 Are there people here who were in the same situation or worked in all of the fields and can give advice? 
 Salary wise DevOps seem good and fits the dynamics i think of.

I've heard people say that c++ primer is relevant and then I've heard others say that it is not good for novices. I've heard that Programming: Principles and Practice using c++ (PPP) is great and then I've also heard that it teaches bad practices so I'm just a little confused. Is there another good resource that I'm missing? What book should I purchase to begin learning?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently been interested in branchless programming, and I was using u64::leading_zeros for an algorithm. However, I noticed on Godbolt than on x86 architecture, leading_zeros was compiled into bsf instruction, and because because bsf doesn't support zero, compiler has to add a test before and a conditional branching.
 I know that lzcnt exists now, and it can be enabled using -C target-feature=+lzcnt, as explained here, but that's not the subject of this post.
 So I've wrote a branchless version of `u64::leading_zeros*, that you can find on the playground. We can verify on Godbolt that there is no more branching.
 EDIT: as suggested in comment, the following version is simpler https://godbolt.org/z/1qYeG6cbo
 Obviously, I've no idea of the performance of this function just by looking at the assembly, and I don't really expect it to be faster; at least, performance should be consistent. However, I don't have an x86 architecture to bench it (Apple Silicon spotted), so I decided to write a Reddit post to ask if there are interested folks who would mind doing it and share the results 😬
 If I could, I would do a benchmark with multiple random numbers, to mess with CPU branch prediction, and also a benchmark with only one number, to (maybe) help the CPU. But I'm neither a CPU expert, nor a benchmark expert.

Basically I took a cloud tech support position after 2 years of applying after graduation and getting nothing. Long story short my company took initiative to upskill us tech support guys to developer positions because we demonstrate a strong fundamental in soft skills and cloud knowledge. Sure it’s “tech support” but can you really complain when it’s 100k remote and you have your foot in the door?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A common denominator in a hardware system (be it a microcontroller, a microcomputer or a computer) is the processor (or microprocessor - a.k.a. CPU). Among its most common elements are the instruction cycle, the dedicated registers (program counter, index register, stack pointer), and the general purpose registers. We also find other external elements also managed by the processor such as memory (RAM - here the stack is also managed - & ROM), I/O peripherals, or communication buses.
 In the emulation process it is obvious to me which hardware component corresponds to each of the previously mentioned elements, which facilitates the process of encapsulation of the code. The case of emulation of the CHIP-8 interpreter creates some doubts for me.
 I understand that the CHIP-8 interpreter embedded in a microcomputer (like the console COSMAC VIP) is a program written using the instruction set of the corresponding processor (e.g. RCA COSMAC) used to execute other programs (a.k.a. ROM) written using the instruction set of the CHIP-8 interpreter itself.
 At first, reading some implementation guides, I thought that when they referred to elements like the program counter, the index register or the general purpose registers they were referring to the physical resources of the processor. However, now I doubt if these elements are virtualizations of the CHIP-8 interpreter, that is, variables that the CHIP-8 interpreter creates and manages dynamically in the RAM memory of the microcomputer.
 I imagine that it could be this way because otherwise, in case the processor PC was pointing to a ROM instruction (using the CHIP-8 interpreter instruction set) and tried to decode, it would fail. Is this how it really works? Is it not? Is it partially?
 Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't quite understand how these three elements fit together: processor, execution of the CHIP-8 interpreter and execution of the ROM.
 Thanks in advance.

  int scores[] = {100, 90, 80}; int *score_ptr{scores};int scores[] = {100, 90, 80}; int *score_ptr{scores}; *score_ptr++; std::cout<<*score_ptr<<"\n"; // 90 
 The above code prints out 90 as expected.
 But instead of the last 2 lines, when I do 
 std::cout<<*score_ptr++<<"\n"; //100
 it prints out 100. Why is that so? Shouldn't it also print out 90?

They problem I'm having is that I can only access their dialog once. Once the Marines are active I've lost that ability. I can however still issue them commands (follow/hold position) by pressing action. I 'm trying to change that. I was wondering if mapping a new action key specifically for dialog would stop it conflicting with the marine orders.
 Also, I wondering if the code is missing a tag of some sort. does "Activation THINGSPEC_Activate" have something to do with what i'm on about?
 Thank you in advance! I'd be happy to send the code to anybody interested in helping me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Experimenting for the first time with modules and running into all sorts of confusing errors. This one in particular seems interesting, would be happy if anyone is able to say with confidence what the behaviour should be.
 // mod.ixx export module mod; export struct s { /*inline*/ auto make_lambda() const { return [/*this*/]{}; } }; // main.cxx import mod; int main () { auto const s1 = s{}; auto const f = s1.make_lambda(); auto const g = f; // error here } 
 Clang says no available copy constructor, whereas gcc compiles but fails to link with multiple definition errors. Capturing this satisfies the linker for gcc but makes no difference for clang. Adding inline (regardless of capture) fixes things for both.
 I read previously that omitting inline on a member function declared within the class definition in a module interface has somewhat similar behaviour as if the function implementation were in a cpp file. However in the case of deduced return type, splitting declaration and definition in that way wouldn't be allowed; regardless I'm unsure how that relates to these errors, and it's not clear to me that there should be anything wrong with omitting inline in this case.

I used various programming languages (Python, JS, TS, Groovy) but the most of the projects were small and the complexity came rather from poor architectural decisions (all in into serverless) rather from the business logic.
 I noticed that my programming muscles started to atrophy when I started writing a Terraform provider. I decided to shift away from SRE related work back towards developing software. Go was my choice because it fits the area where I am mostly active (cli, tooling and backend). I noticed that many devs from different ecosystems (Rust, Java, C++ etc.) scoff on golang for being too simple. I don't think that is really the case.
 For one, It took me a lot of time to familiarise with the Go's stdlib that is quite extensive. Writing idiomatic Go code is not that easy since the language is quite unique in many ways (concurrency, error handling, types, io.Reader and io.Writer). On top of that memory management is quite bizarre. I get the pointers without pointer arithmetic. I really enjoy all of this, I just think using it as intended is not that simple as some state outright.
 I get a little defensive because I am quite experienced engineer and It clearly took longer than expected to learn the Go. The language that supposed to be "simple" and to quote Rob Pike:
  
The key point here is our programmers are Googlers, they’re not researchers. They’re typically, fairly young, fresh out of school, probably learned Java, maybe learned C or C++, probably learned Python. They’re not capable of understanding a brilliant language but we want to use them to build good software. So, the language that we give them has to be easy for them to understand and easy to adopt.
  
That is a little condescending because it should be the logic/product to be complex and brilliant - not the programming language. It is like criticising a sculpturer for using a simple chizzle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I have noticed for all the time I spent here is how many weird takest here is on anything related to not money or coding here. You know, like the ones that is part of being a human and working at a company
 I was debating in this thread https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1dl54cg/would_you_attend_a_company_party_if_your_boss_and/ and the vibe(as zoomers say) i get from people is just so odd compared to all jobs I've had. Just the recent example, but I lost count of similar threads and mindset. A lot of posts on like r/antiwork gives of the same feeling. 
 Stuff I commonly see is(and to be clear, its not one person saying/doing all this):
  
I don't need to be friends with people at work because I have other friends
 
Never drink more than 2 beers then you will say stupid things and get fired the next day. 
 
Just go but leave early because... i don't know
 
Why would I ever want to hang out with people I don't know
 
I don't go to events not duiring office hours because not paid(and no company will ever have a party from like 14-18 lol so what a ultra weird take)
 
People are older/not same education as me/different office/something so it's 0 benefit for me even talking to them
 
more stuff...
 
 With that said, I do not mean one should sink 25 beers each company event and stay until 0400 and be expected to talk with 50 people each event. But you know, some common sense is just missing. In my experience for example, the people who work in IT or sales are the best drinkers, and this "only 2 beers" mentality I literally never seen. and as another post said, its who you know not what you know after a certain level and what you can be remembered as
 yes you can be someone who dont like alcohol or whatever because addiction, that's fine it's not those guys I mean
 Where do you think all of this is coming from? Young people? asperger types who post on reddit and not just exist and do normal things in their company? Others?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[iequal = case insensitive string equality
 it seems like you can do (char & 0xdf) or (wchar_t & 0xffdf) to convert a lowercase/uppercase utf8/utf16 code unit to a uppercase utf8/utf16 code unit
 similarly you can do (char & 0xff) or (wchar_t & 0xffff) to not make any changes to the utf8/utf16 code unit
 so, if you know at compile time, what content you want to check to see the string iequal to, you can make a mask based on the content
 for example mask of utf8 "infinity" = (u64)0xdfdfdfdfdfdfdfdf for example mask of utf8 "asdf0123" = (u64)0xffffffffdfdfdfdf 
 you can then make a function to do iequal very very fast
 bool iequal_asdf0123_utf8(std::string_view s) { return s.size() == 8 && (*(const u64*)(s.data()) & 0xffffffffdfdfdfdf) == *(const u64*)"ASDF0123"; } 
 and to generalize this, you can probably make something like this
 template<FixedString a> bool iequal(std::string_view s) { if(a.size()!=s.size())return false; //some meta programming stuff } 
 not asking for implementation. just want to know is there any problem with my assumption, i only need my code to work on x86/x64, dont care about other endianess

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're all familiar with the use of 'dd' to write installers, the good old
 sudo dd if=installer.img of=/dev/sda2 bs=1M status=progress 
 dance. It works, but it's not great:
  
The progress info doesn't show progress as a percentage, nor does it calculate an ETA, it just shows bytes written.
 dd's default block size is a bad fit for most modern systems, hence the bs= parameter.
 It's easy to forget status=progress, and including it every time is a bit annoying.
  
Now, dd doesn't do anything special: it just reads from one file and writes to another. Tools like pv and cat could do the exact same thing. The only reason people really use dd for this purpose is that you can run dd as root, whereas redirecting the output of cat or pv requires running the shell itself as root. sudo dd ... is more terse than sudo sh -c 'cat ...'.
 A few weeks ago, I got annoyed with dd and implemented a --output option to the excellent tool called pv ("Pipe Viewer"). This meant that I could write images using sudo pv -o /dev/sda2 ... instead of using dd.
 Well, a week ago, PV released version 1.8.10 which contains my --output feature! Once your distribution updates to the latest version, you too can use pv instead of dd. Here are some advantages:
  
pv shows an actual progress bar and an ETA, rather than just bytes written.
 pv automatically detects optimal buffer sizes.
 pv is more terse, since there is no need to specify status=progress or bs=....
  
To ue pv instead of dd, simply run:
 sudo pv installer.img -Yo /path/to/block/device 
 (The -Y is useful because it causes pv to sync after every write. This avoids the issue where the transfer hangs for a long time at 100% as buffers are flushed to the drive. -Yo is a nice mnemonic to remember :))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quick question: Dereferencing pointer-to-array is basically a no-op, so is it legit even if the pointer is null?
 int main(void) { int *ptr = 0 , printf(const char *, ...); printf("%p\n", (void *)*(int (*)[1])ptr); printf("wasn't actually dereferenced\n"); } 
 We first cast ptr to int (*)[1] and then dereference it (the void * cast is only meant for "%p").
 The pedant in me says this is still undefined behavior, as the standard mentions:
  
If an invalid value has been assigned to the pointer, the behavior of the unary * operator is undefined.102)
 102) ... Among the invalid values for dereferencing a pointer by the unary * operator are a null pointer, ...
  
Reference: https://port70.net/~nsz/c/c11/n1570.html#6.5.3.2p4
 I'm looking for a second opinion, as I may have overlooked some part of the standard that implies my code is fine.
 Motivation: Last month I posted a question to confirm if a well-known style of calling malloc works with VLA.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/1ck4azy/is_the_recommended_malloc_style_suitable_for_vla/
 If the standard blesses dereference of invalid array pointer (due to no-op), then my earlier concern is also resolved.

 What I was wondering is if there was a best recommendation for a book that covers CPP in depth. The kind of book that would not be recommended for beginners, and does not waste time covering the basics of programming. But instead covers the kind of information seniors in the field would want to know about the language. 
 If it helps at all, I plan to use CPP to do graphics, and planned on learning CPP through graphics projects, but wanted some supplementary learning to get deep with the language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, it just came to my mind and I'm not sure is this legit worry or just a laughable thought
 I'm using a bluetooth earbuds paired with my PC in my home. I'm thinking about using it at workplace, pairing it also with another PC at my workplace
 Is it possible for a virus or malware to infect the PC at my home, an then get into my Bluetooth earbuds connected to it, and infect the PC at my workplace when I connect the infected earbuds to it?
 Thank you in advance :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quite often, I see code written like the first pseudo code example below. I always write it as the second example.
 What are the pros and cons?
 Without really knowing the guts on the compiler and what goes on at runtime, I get the feeling the code in the first example is doing more than it needs to. Which is one of the reasons I'd write it like the second example, and the reason I'm asking. But also (subjectively) real estate and readability.
 Edit: This question is intended to better my knowledge of what occurs at runtime, and is a purely imaginary scenario. This is not code in my project. Although it was pretty close on the first draft of a Method I was creating, which made me consider the question.
 Of course I ended up casting the object once, before call time, and having an overloaded Method.
 For anyone interested, the method is part of navigating and expanding items in a TreeView with a path to the target item as input. So the first call to my overloaded method is a TreeView, and the rest are that of a custom class derived from TreeViewItem.
 Thank you all for your comments, I appreciate your time and insight.
  private void DoSomething(object list, int index) { if((list as OtherObject).Items.count > index) { OtherObject.SubItem subObject = (list as OtherObject).Items[(list as OtherObject).Items.count]; } else { OtherObject.SubItem subObject = (list as OtherObject).Items[index]; } } private void DoSomething(object list, int index) { OtherObject otherObject = (list as OtherObject); int count = otherObject.Items.count; if (count > index) { OtherObject.SubItem subObject = otherObject.Items[count]; } else { OtherObject.SubItem subObject = otherObject.Items[index]; } }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently wrote a guide on how to use Steam-Stats during the Next Fest to help us gather information.
 Considering that Stats and Achievements are closely related by nature, I’d like to share another interesting takeaway from this Fest process: I realized that adding achievement to Demo is actually quite good
 I first encountered this design in a friend’s farm/animal-related game demo over the past few months. The feeling of receiving an achievement when successfully completing the demo was fantastic, totally unlike the usual “play through the demo and then nothing” experience.
 At that moment, I realized that I should share the feel that way in my game too!
 Also because I found it can:
  
Help you track your completion-rates of your demo
 Provide a sense of reward and completion for players
 Make your demo stand out more on players’ Steam profiles 
 it may also easy to let your demo enter their Perfect-Games list
 
  
I finally put only 1 achv in my Demo at the ending, it works & looks well ( Check out the effect here )
 Meanwhile, as mentioned in the article I posted and linked at the beginning, you can also use the Web-API GetGlobalAchievementPercentagesForApp( ) to get the completion-rates more directly
 As someone who actively seeks out and enjoys playing different demos, I really hope to see more developers try do this in the future!
 Since your demo is separate from the main game, this definitely gives you extra space to design and unleash creativity in achievements (Or at least, plan for an ending achv! That feeling is really great!><)
 Thank you for your reading
 Wish you have a good trip in your next Next-Fest!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a program to process and forward AIS data in network packets from/to multiple ports. It uses go (in Go) and fork (in Perl) to create a thread for each data stream. With about 22 data streams the original Perl program used about 1% of CPU. It used a lot of memory because Perl loads a copy of the command interpreter for each fork, so about 3.5MB per stream.
 In Go the memory use is down to about 10% of what it was before, but the CPU usage is between 6% and 8%, which surprised me.
 Would you expect a Go program to use more CPU than the same program in Perl? Can anyone suggest tools to analyse what is using the resources?
 Just for information - this is the innermost function that filters out non-AIS messages and makes sure that each sentence has the required cr/lf terminator. This gets called for each packet that is passed, sometimes there is more than one sentence in a packet, but not always.
 func Clean(bytdata []byte) []byte { // fix missing \r\n characters and duplicate \n\n // drop non-AIS messages regcrlf := regexp.MustCompile(`\r|\n`) // eol characters regx := regexp.MustCompile(`\*([A-F]|[0-9]){2}`) // NMEA checksum pattern crlf := []byte{'\r', '\n'} // strip existing eols bytdata = regcrlf.ReplaceAll(bytdata, []byte("")) // find checksum positions missing := regx.FindAllIndex(bytdata, -1) var newdata []byte x := 0 y := 0 for i := 0; i < len(missing); i++ { y = missing[i][1] if bytes.HasPrefix(bytdata[x:y], []byte("!A")) { // Valid AIS sentence, add to returned slice newdata = slices.Concat(newdata, bytdata[x:y], crlf[:]) } x = y } return newdata }

 Here's the scenario, I am working in a civil engineering firm that uses a pretty daunting approaches to data processing (manual entry in excel). And some of it outside of excel in a very old software that was created somewhere in 2005. The software is still relevant and valid however the process is quite similar to manual data entry. I have automated most of the excel but I am unable to find some way to have C# insert the raw files for me, have the software process it and then take the result file (xlsx file) for further processing.
 Here's where I am at a dead end. How would make C# run the software for me?

The pay is really good etc but I have to live in large city which doesn't agree with me, I grew up in the country on a farm and everything about city living makes me miserable and I've sort of reached a breaking point now.
 I don't need a job that's out in nature the entire time but I do want something that has an element of the outdoors or field work or similar that is adjacent to a software/data engineering role. I guess what I'm asking is, what are some not so obvious roles that would benefit from a cs/math degree that will get me out a bit.
 Thanks, and apologies if this question has been asked before

 I've never had trouble like this. I checked the GLM manual on github, specifically the section on aligned types, and my code looks exactly like the example code. It just doesn't work. What do I need to do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I am a seasoned Software Architect, who spent the first 10 years of my career building mostly enterprise applications using C++ , then later switched to Java. Since I wasn't really dealing with ultra low latency requirements my C++ knowledge is not that deep but I believe that with the right resources and my background, I could probably gain enough knowledge to be at least inter-viewable.
 Here are some of my questions I have about the role:
  
1. If I can demonstrate that I am very proficient in low latency C++ without having worked in the finance domain, do I have a chance to get hired?
 Does a middle aged applicant have any disadvantages when applying or is it viewed an asset to be more experienced.
 Are C++ engineers in the HFT world just backoffice resources who are kept in the dark and code or is there any customer interaction or business trips to meet with clients and other colleges?
 Finally, I know there is a lot of online C++ training and lots of books that touch on the subject. I usually learn much better if those elements are taught in a project specific way . I am hoping there is an excellent course out there that lets you build an actual low latency trading platform from ground up , teaching you a fundamental concept at each step. The only resource I have found is this book:Building low latency applications with C++. Does anyone know if there is an actual course out there that uses this approach , I tried Udemy and Plurasight but couldn't find anything.
  
Thank you in advance for any response.

 However, more and more I am told (or maybe I just hear it) that learning some rust is at this point becoming all but a necessity for people in the very early stages of their career, that is, if one wants to hedge against significant possible changes in the programming language landscape. Not that cpp will ever 'die', but with program safety coming more and more under the microscope, at least in certain areas (e.g., adoption of rust into linux, albeit cpp never used there as opposed to plain c), perhaps some newer languages will get a 'boost' in adoption.
 The thing that puts me off about the rust programming language are some of the dramas with the community…]]></summary>

Are the components of the C# programming language free or paid? What is the future of C# language? Can the C# language create one program on different platforms with one code? What is the fate of the Xamrin language, which was developed through C#? 
 And thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, we are a small company where the ops team consists of one manager and a few ICs (including myself). We initially hoped to expand the ops team, but due to a pivot in product direction, we had to let some members go and condense the team. Now, the team realistically won't be growing much.
 From my understanding, the role of an engineering manager, especially for ops, is to set priorities, shield their team from the bureaucracy of the other C-levels, and manage reviews and career growth. However, I've encountered a few roadblocks due to our manager's lack of technical expertise:
 - Communication Issues: The manager acts as a middleman, relaying requirements from other VPs to our team and then passing our feedback back. This has backfired because he doesn’t fully understand the technical asks from other teams.
 - Unclear Priorities: It's unclear whether the principal engineer or the engineering manager should set technical priorities. This has led to some discord.
 - Indecisiveness and Micromanagement: The manager seems indecisive, avoiding assigning tasks to avoid conflict, yet becomes micromanaging when tasks aren't completed as expected.
 While he is a good people person, his lack of technical skills and decisiveness is impacting the team. My teammates feel the same way. I’m looking for advice from fellow engineers who have had similar experiences. Currently, my plan is to collate examples and discuss them with my team, then have a talk with him to provide feedback. If there’s no change, we may need to escalate the issue to his boss. However, I want to give him a chance to respond to our feedback first before taking it higher.
 Anyone else have this issue? Any feedback would be appreciated

 Additionally, I'm not sure what a reference is. It would be really helpful if someone could explain this in simple terms and also the difference between return *this and return this.
 Also, what's the use case with return *this and return this?
 Code examples are also greatly appreciated! Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, two months ago I fully released my first game and it has sold decently. That's why I've thought that it would be a good idea to translate the game in other languages and already started to translate into german because that's the one language I can do myself. However, after weeks of translating, I realized that the game is quite wordy. There are more than 150k words in the game that would need to be translated and I'd estimate that a welldone translation would most likely cost me about 20k$.
 Honestly, I don't have any data to draw from to be able to say whether an investment like that would be worth it. I'm close to just trying it out and see what happens.
 So I was wondering if any of you have any insights or data you'd be willing to share.
 Here's the game as reference: Link

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I’m learning cpp. I didn’t want to post this but my research led me nowhere. I used to do unreal but not anymore. While I’m learning cpp I got confused with it. My confusion is how do you affect more than one class in a function. 
 For example if I wanted my class zombie to “attack”(this is text based) any other classes they deemed enemy such as a player or npc how do you do that without making everthing an instance, would sharing variables help, maybe a vector and adding each class and then using vector to harm? . Ik this can be done in some instances with inheritability but not every situation is like that. 
 In unreal there’s a way to tag each class using a name or string variable the using its version of an interface but I don’t know enough of cpp to know if there’s a version of unreal interface in cpp, I’d learned about cpp interfaces but they seem different.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context: new grad I accepted a role at one company about 2 weeks ago. I had every intention of working there but I got an offer that is more appealing recently (pay and more interesting work). The job I’m leaving is with a large company but not one I would want to go back to and would be fine with it if they never hired me again. Just worried about if they could potentially blackball me from other companies. For reference it isn’t a large tech company. Normally I wouldn’t really consider it but they misled me a little bit about the role I would have with them I was told I would be full stack but would go through a team matching phase where I would be placed sort of based on aptitude and could probably have a little say in whether or not I would be more backend or front end focused, but I would still be full-stack. But I was just assigned to a purely front end role (I’m a backend guy) on a team and was not told that till After I started.
 Am I going to be labeled for doing this by other companies? Would this hurt my future at other places?

I still want to keep the Windows, so I thought if I can make it dual-bootable and download some Linux distro on the second hard drive where I just save all my files because it's got much more memory ( roughly 300 gb, first one has ~130 gb ). I also wanted to firstly try some Linux distro on VirtualBox, but turns out that my laptop doesn't support virtualisation. Then I wanted to try it using live-usb but it would be very slow if I'd use it very often. Don't ask me why, I just decided to try and install Arch on that second drive. But in case IF something will go wrong during installation, I'll still be able to use Windows?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi !
 Title says it all or almost. I have been working as a programmer for a little over 2y now. First only C# and Angular which is also what I studied (2y cursus). About a year or so ago, my work started having me work in C++ (id say maybe 18 months now?).
 While I am doing it, I have 0 actual knowledge of C++, or well, lets be generous and say 0.5 because I did learn some stuff along the way. It is a strange position to be in, as I can be coding quite complicated C++ code (or rather quite complicated program features, in code I am sure is nowhere near as effective as it could be).
 All while not really understanding why I am doing what I am doing.
 Which means I also find tutorials at beginner's level incredibly boring (and not being worth my time) while advanced stuff just, well, loses me pretty fast. Maybe good to know I do not come from an engineering/CS background. I did a 2y education that was very hands-on, and have very little knowledge of the hardware side of programming for example.
 I have 3 small children and a full time job, so time is limited. Id say maybe 5h a week is the max I can commit to this.
 Ideal would of course be to be mentored through work, but this has been discussed numerous times, with a promise of the odd hour per week 1-on-1 with one of the very seniors developpers, but they are so busy it has literally never happened.
 Im thinking pointers? Vectors? Is there for example Udemy classes that focus on such "small" concepts? Good youtube channels?
 TY:)

 1 program main 2 print *, "let's make a variable name" 3 4 integer::myVar 5 end program main 
 It'll thow an error at lines 1, 4 and 5 saying that it's an unrecognized syntax. I've got it in my head that I need to store the variable names in an array so that the checker (or maybe a seperate function) can "cross-check" the variable in the text editor and the one that's in the array. Although I don't know if this is the right approach this is the one I'm going with for now, my main dilema is I don't know how I would:
  
Get the variable name from the editor
 
store that variable name in an array for a later date
 
 could anybody help me or give me some pointers on what would be the best direction to go in for this?

 I am learning networking using C. I am currently trying to make a chat server using C and am experiencing a weird, nasty bug. The client code seems to be connecting to the server. However, using the select function, the server isn't actually detecting the attempted connection or firing off any errors or any of the logging code I put in indicating a connection was received. An initial error I found was that I wasn't rebuilding the fd_set at the start of every loop, but even after fixing that error I'm still experiencing the same issue. I feel like I'm missing something fundamental but I can't for the life of me figure it out. Some insight might be helpful. I've been using geekforgeek and beej's guide to aid me.
 My code is a bit long and can be found here: https://github.com/Fewshin/10…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider
 #include <stdio.h> typedef enum { BLUE, RED, OTHER } Color ; void print_color( Color clr) { if(clr == BLUE) { printf("Blue\n") ; } else if(clr == RED) { printf("Red\n") ; } else { printf("Other\n") ; } } int main() { Color clr = BLUE ; print_color(clr) ; print_color(RED) ; // Is this ok? return 0 ; } 
 I am wondering if it's ok to call print_color(RED) , rather than using an intermediary variable. The code works, which is surprising, because thought it would be forbidden due to the possibility of clashing with a #define. Is it UB I'm seeing or is it actually ok?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, I’d like to thank this sub for being helpful on my journey where I currently don’t have senior colleagues. 
 The problem: it’s an early-stage startup. We’re just two developers: I’m around the mid level, they’re a co-founder and have no programming/CS background (basically junior), there’re no seniors and no CTO. Unfortunately, lately, I realized that the code they have been written is not well-thought and doesn’t allow to develop new features fast (we haven’t had code reviews because of tight deadlines). It also seems to me that everyone has been doing things their way, so there’s no consistency (linter is set up but seems to be ignored). 
 Long story short, I failed with delivering expectations because I had to spend extra time by untangling what was written prior me. (I’m not a genius myself and provide nonoptimal/bad solutions too). I believe, though, it would be quite important to communicate to my boss that they need to revise their approach to writing code if they want us to be efficient and to be able to work together. I don’t think they’re aware of the issue. So far their main argument and approach was “It works. Users don’t care”, which I agree with but I also think there should be some balance because it’s getting harder to have a collaborative work. 
 Should I tell my boss that they need to work on their code? If yes, how would you communicate it politely without pointing any fingers? Or does it sound like a hopeless situation and it’d be better to just give up on it and start looking for something else?
 TL;DR: my boss is a co-founder, not an SWE but contributes to the codebase. Lately, it’s been really hard to get through their code and work efficiently. They don’t seem to be aware of it. Should I tell them and how, or the situation is hopeless because of the power imbalance, and I should just give up and start looking for something else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I build a multiplayer platformer game using monogame, using TCP sockets. The clients sends the server updates about their player (position, bullets and such) and the server pass those messages also to all the other clients. I have a List of ClientAtServer (object I created) that each interact with a different client. I have a method "passToAll" that passed the message the server recieved from one client to all the other clients (going in a for loop over the list and sending the message using their BinaryWriter). Each time I accept a client he is added to the list, and the opposite for the removal of a player. It shows me an error saying the collection (clients) was modified. There is a way to use a lock that would stop the passToAll method ONLY if a clients gets added or removed, WITHOUT blocking two different threads to use the passToAll method?
 Normal lock makes it REALLY slow and unstable
 public static void passToAll(string message, int senderID)
 { //Passing the wanted message to all the other clients
 AllUsing.clients.TrimExcess();
 foreach (var client in AllUsing.clients)
 {
 if (client != null && client.clientID != senderID && client.didHandshake)
 {
 client.sendData(message);
 }
 }
 }
 from the adding client logic:
 TcpClient tcpClient = listener.AcceptTcpClient();
 ClientAtServer clientAtServer = new ClientAtServer(nextID, tcpClient);
 AllUsing.clients.Add(clientAtServer);

So I figured I am close being that visual studio is detecting the files are there but the compiler just isn’t understanding. So any good tutorials specifically designed for this stuff would be helpful to see how I am messing up. All I have found was low quality / low effort videos.

 How much of an effect does something like this have on a player?
 Do you care if a game won't let you resize their windowed version of the game? Do you care if a game doesn't have a windowed mode at all?
 Does this affect things like streaming at all? If someone wants to stream my game, is windowed mode something I need to consider?
 I'm just wasting so much time trying to figure this out, and I feel like I'm too stupid to include this feature and want to just opt out. My game looks great at the 16:9 aspect ratio, and already accounts for people who have widescreen monitors (when playing fullscreen), but I just can't for the life of me figure out how to resize my game in windowed mode

 A common thing I keep seeing in this subreddit is attacking certain people in this industry because they are “Indian” or “Chinese” or boomers or whatever. But the reality is, there are gonna be terrible people and good people that you’ll meet in this industry, regardless of their ethnicity, age, etc.
 What will differentiate YOU as a successful developer or any position in this field is being able to find common ground to work with anyone and get things done. I’ve had experiences where I worked with people I really didn’t like, and we made it work and they ended up offering me referrals to other companies.
 Technical skill can only take you so far. There will always be a better programmer than you. But if you show respect and kindness to others, you’ll be surprised how far it’ll take you in this industry.

 This is my output: 0x1004f4000
 I have done this for local variables, function pointers, pointers, all kinds of data types across 2 systems and my pointer address length never changes. I have 2 64 bit systems, one every pointer address is always 9bytes long, in the other its 12. even printed in expanded format with all 0s the pointer address will always have the same number of leading 0s. How is it with with the address randomizer across stack, and heap I always get a pointer address with these same number of information bits. At some point shouldnt I get an address with 8 bytes or some variation?

 I think the hardest things for me are (1) I'm finding that candid feedback isn't really valued. (2) It seems like the most successful folks end up bluffing on some questions especially if the higher-up is digging into an unnecessary level of detail.

 I recently created a RESTful API/web service using WCF. 
 It has two public endpoints:
 The 1st endpoint returns a JSON stream that includes all employees: http://myserver.com/MyService.svc/Employees
 The 2nd endpoint takes a parameter and is used to delete an employee by deleting a table row: http://myserver.com/MyService.svc/DeleteEmp/EmpId=123
 Colleague A created a JavaScript chart that ingests the JSON stream from the 1st URL endpoint and draws it into a pie chart.
 Colleague B created a console app that calls the 2nd URL in order to delete employees that have already retired.
 Is colleague A doing a HTTP GET request of a json object and colleague B doing a HTTP POST request?

 I do realise why the first function doesn't modify the variable, since variables are passed to functions as values. But since variables are passed as values, why doesn't the square() function raise an lvalue assignment error on compilation, as 5 = 5*5; would?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Reddit, I've been working on a personal project called Octagrm - building a simplified Instagram clone using ASP.NET Core 8. It's been a blast learning about web API, SignalR for real-time features, and all the fun bits in between.
 What's inside?
  
User authentication & registration with Jwt tokens and user profiles.
 Posting photos with captions and hashtags.
 Liking & commenting on posts.
 Following & unfollowing users.
 Real-time direct messaging with SignalR.
 Notifications for likes, comments, and follows.
 Searching for users, posts, and hashtags.
 Even stories that disappear after a while!
  
Initially, I wanted to undertake a project focused on CRUD operations. My first thought was to clone Facebook using a microservices architecture, but that seemed like a massive undertaking for a junior developer. So, I decided to aim for a more manageable project—Instagram—using a clean architecture.
 Feedback and constructive criticism are welcome! You can check it on GitHub. Octagrm on Github

 https://www.georgefairbanks.com/ieee-software-v37-n3-may-2020-testing-numbs-us-to-our-loss-of-intellectual-control
 The author defines intellectual control as having a model of the code in your head that's simpler than the code itself.
 Statistical Control, on the other hand, is where you believe the code to be correct because the tests on the code are passing, but you don't actually understand the code itself.
 Personally, I can remember numerous times where I refactored large swaths of code, maintaining confidence I hadn't broken existing behavior because the tests and types were passing, but I didn't actually have a compact mental model of the system as a whole. If someone had asked me to redesign the system I was refactoring, I wouldn't be able to do it since I didn't really understand it.
 Also, this kind of underlies bus factors etc, where a person leaves the company and you have software systems that you now only have statistical control over, but not intellectual control any more. Often having to painfully regain intellectual control.
 I'm curious to hear stories of teams that ran heavy on statistical control (maybe a catchall team that inherited orphan systems). Or maybe stories where you saw intellectual control slipping away and how it went.

 Currently I'm preparing for an exam in my masters degree and the exam will be writing code, obviously, on paper. I can solve all mock exam questions just fine, but when I test the code, there are some little bugs here and there, incorrect boundaries, some index errors. In real world it would take me about 2 minutes to iron out these bugs, but in the exam I'm expected to get everything perfect from the scratch and if I don't, I lose grading.
 How to prepare better for such experience? I feel like I'm stressing out because of some stupid outdated practice straight from early 90s, but there's no way to avoid it.

 This new feature should be enough for smaller websites, though there may still be some kinks to work out for larger applications. Here's a super short example to illustrate how it works:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm implementing something that should accept multiple types, so long as they satisfy/implement a specific interface that I'm requiring.
 I'm debating whether to use runtime polymorphism (i.e. virtual functions), or make my API a template with C++20 concepts.
 Main considerations to take into account:
  
Runtime polymorphism is not ACTUALLY needed in this case. I know at compile-time the concrete type that I want to use when using this API. So virtual functions are on the table just for the mechanism of enforcing an implementation of a specific API
 Runtime cost is not so important here. The cost of pointer indirection with virtual functions is negligble here. So I can afford using virtual functions even though I don't really require the runtime aspect of it.
  
IMO the main reason to use virtual functions over templates - template implementations generally have to be placed in the header file, which is not ideal.
 IMO the main reason to use templates over virtual functions - I'm a strong believer of using the "weakest" tool needed for the job. This makes the intention of your code clear and concise.
 The runtime aspect provided by virtual functions seems like an overkill, and in terms of readability, future readers will have to read the code and scratch their heads just to figure out if runtime polymorphism was needed here or not.
 In general, it feels like template+concepts is the way that C++ seems to want me to do stuff (correct me if you think this is wrong) when all I need is compile-time polymorphism.
 Non of the reasons mentioned above convince me in any direction.
 Which would you choose in this case, virtual functions, or templates+concepts? Are there any other options/arguments I'm missing here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not comparing or arguing because I can not tell of course.
 But going down the wrong path may consume years.
 So may someone tell me if this approach is right or wrong?
 I mean to learn C before C++?
 One of the things I remember from what I've read is that C++ will let you do everything by hand and that will force you to learn the right way.
 Another thing I read was that one of the main things in programming is object-oriented programming, and you can not fully understand it unless you know how things used to be done before it in C language.
 Another thing is that I read if you learn programming in C language and do projects in C, you will need to unlearn many things, go down the mountain of procedures and functional programming, and start to climb the object-oriented mountain with c++.
 I am serious and can not make up my mind yet because I am a newbie and a novice.
 So what is the right path?
 I am not asking because I am lazy or because I want to take the easy path, but I want the right path whatever it takes.
 I hope you have the time to give me serious advice that may help me to have a programming career and change my life for the better.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes I know. My title is super vague but as a complete beginner in C++, I have no idea where the problem comes from in this ,new to me, stack: the compiler (clang), the builder (ninja) or my IDE.
 I am trying to make a simple Hello World works on my mac M1. The particularity is I am trying to use "import std;" (mainly because the book I found for beginners use that directly)
 After plenty of others problems resolved, the last one is the one that brings me here. Here is the last line of the errors:
 ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64 clang-18: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) ninja: build stopped: subcommand failed. 
 This is a simple Hello World program so no fancy import.
 Here is the config of my toolchain in CLion:
  
 CMake: /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake 
  
 Build Tool: /opt/homebrew/bin/ninja 
  C Compiler: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/llvm/18.1.7/bin/clang-18 
  C++ Compiler: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/llvm/18.1.7/bin/clang-18 
  Debugger Bundled LLDB 
 
 I don't know if you need more information than that. In my CMakeLists.txt nothing fancy I guess, especially nothing related to the architecture or the cross-compiling.
 Here is the command line generated by....actually I don't know if it is CMake, Ninja or my IDE

 Curiously, the Japanese version of Pokemon Yellow (also MBC3) loads just fine.
 My emulator is passing all of Blargg’s cpu instruction tests. Timers, including system timers for pokemon (RTC) have been implemented and appear to be working well. At this point I am unsure what the issue could be.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Is Debian sid good for this purpose?

 Update: Thanks for all the replies and advice given, I realised that I was not at all specific with this question but the comments still helped, I'm going to look at all the recommended languages but I'll stick to python for now until I made up my mind on what direction to go, for now I'm thinking about cyber security and game or app development as a hobby so learning "programming" as a whole like several of you recommended seem to be my best course of action

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes I have this fear that cpp developers will increasingly be veterans (with decades of cpp experience), whereas with learning a newer language, even though it might be much less mature, the 'playing field' might be much more level because so many things are new (e.g., rust). 
 Is this thinking about it in the wrong way? I know cpp isn't going away, at least not any time soon. But the road to C++17, let alone even newer standards, seems so long. What would you do if you were standing at the bottom of the C++ mountain, like me, in 2024?

I know basics of python already (basics, file handling, functions, etc), HTML and am thinking about doing DSA in C++ after completing its basics (when i am in college). Can anyone guide me on how to get started?? Like best tutorials for C C++ (bro code or free coding camp org?? Or some other free text based resource for C with small basic projects in between) And what all topics should I cover ?? (Plzz provide me with road map if u can) Also what are some best ways to learn programing in general?? Just follow one tutorial and practice or should I use text based docs and see tutorial of only some confusing parts?? Also plzz suggest some small and real life projects to test myself as I progress. 
 U can also suggest me creative ways to learn it or some common mistakes which people make when starting with C

 I'm trying to get in contact with the author (at least kwin, mutter, and hyprland will need recompiling), but for now I'd strongly advise to be careful with updating :-)
 [update] Looks like this is solved now! (for me; but apparently not for others yet)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm currently working on my first FPS shooter game and I'm trying to decide on the best approach for enemy AI. I've done some research and it seems like behavior trees are a popular choice, but I'm not sure if they are the right fit for my project. GOAP on the other hand seems too advanced, and Unstructured AI, too simple.
 Here are a few details about my game:
  
It's a single-player FPS with various types of enemies, being developed in Unity.
 I want the enemies to have a variety of behaviors, including patrolling, attacking (including same enemy type: shooting, melee combat, throwing grenades, switching weapons etc.), taking cover, and retreating.
 I'm looking for a solution that is relatively not too hard to learn and implement, as I'm still in the early stages of learning game development. We are a team of 3 and for now I am the one who is dedicated on the enemy AI.
  
Would behavior trees be a good choice for this type of game? Are there any other AI techniques that you would recommend I consider? Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a SME software house. I work on a relatively small team and until recently, I was the 2nd most senior engineer below the staff level guy. He resigned and I was basically thrown into his position with no plan to replace him.
 Manager read out a new job title to me, explicitly said your role is changing, more design docs, mentoring, less coding. And working on the companies biggest project to date. 
 As soon as this happened I asked to be compensated for the extra responsibility and new role. Seemed like a perfectly reasonable ask. Manager spoke with his, and came back with "actually this is all already part of your current role, so there will be no promotion or compensation adjustment". Then I got some corporate manager bullshit about how it's an opportunity for me etc etc...
 Seems like an opportunity for them to take advantage of me... They have no plan to rehire the guy that just left, clearly they think I can step in that role and do it successfully. 
 Another engineer just below me just also handed in his notice and we effectively have a small team of 2 left. 
 I complained again saying it's bullshit and told my manager how I feel, that they're taking advantage of me and told him I'm very unhappy here. Have a follow up meeting with his manager now on Monday. 
 My manager is quite shit at his job so I feel like he just asked my skip to deal with me. Doubt there will be a favourable outcome for me here. 
 Been interviewing for new jobs. Think it's time to bail. 
 Am I being unreasonable? Is this normal in industry? 
 TLDR: more senior teammate leaves, I am thrown in his position, no promotion or raise. Is this typical? Looking for a new job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All
 I am running AgentDVR which is set to record video to my NAS. I want to also have a backup saved to my Microsoft OneDrive account (ie so I have a cloud backup).
 The NAS is linked as a remote SMB location on Dolphin. I then have mounted a folder from the NAS as a local folder so AgentDVR can save directly to it. At the moment this is working without issue (ie video is successfully being saved from AgentDVR to my NAS).
 I have installed onedriver and mounted my OneDrive folder locally as well. The OneDrive folder is syncing with the cloud in both directions without issue.
 I am stuck at the next step which is trying to have the local mounted NAS folder sync with the mounted OneDrive folder. I want this to be an automated/ongoing process where ideally there is a check for a difference between the folders and if there is the backup is triggered.
 I have tried searching for solutions but I feel like the fact these folders I am trying to sync are remote folders mounted as local ones is causing some issues. Many thanks in advance for anyone that has any tips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's been a lot of performance/ optimization related posts lately. I enjoy reading them. They are, however, not really relevant to my work. How about you?
 I do quite a lot of performance work both in my $job as well as my hobby projects, but when using Casey Muratori's terminology it's about 95% de-pessimization, 4% fake optimization and at most 1% actual optimization.
 The code I'm starting out with has so many low hanging fruit (missing foreign key indizes, SQL Queries in a loop that could easily be cached, Integer when int could be used, ...) that I'm never done de-pessimizing (i.e. removing obviously inefficient/ unneeded computation).
 My question is: are you guys' codebases so good that actual lowlevel optimization is the next step, do you actually "optimize" your code? Is it only me that is working on code so bad that I can always remove/ improve stupid code? How good is the average codebase out there?
 PS: I'm not shitting on my coworkers. When I code something new the first attempt is bad as well, past me is an idiot, too.

Is it possible for a module interface to have multiple implementations ? 
  If yes, how does the compiler resolve which implementation to use ? Mostly curious if the interface and implementations use templates and so on...
  
Also can an implementation serve two different module interfaces ?

 I have found that having a positive attitude going into the interview has been helpful as that's usually mentioned in the feedback I get. Being enthusiastic looks good and can encourage your interviewer to help you! Also, do your research on the company before the interview, what do they do? what are their cultural values?
 The market is rough so don't forget to take care of yourself, get support from friends and family, and don't give up!

I am trying to say that Linux is built ground up for real time and mission critical applications like real time audio processing and machine learning. Windows doesn’t hold a candle in this regard and I’m trying to wrap my head around how much farther along the Linux desktop would be if good software developers (even enterprise/commercial ones) adopted Linux as opposed to Windows. Sorry for the confusion. I still do think there is some headassery (discord mod calls girls kitten energy) but I should have been more clear and the Arch community deserves better.

DVD Drive included would be very nice. One video output and about 5 usb outputs, plus one ethernet is all I need. No Wifi or bluetooth required.
 My old acer gave up and Im so done with acer. I was thinking about a linux-friendly brand like lenovo, tuxedo.. The Fujitsu Esprimo Q558 and Q958 also seem pretty solid but Im not so sure about linux hardware compatibility. I love linux-hardware.org for research ur their database not always have those mini PCs.
 Have u guys maybe one of this kind and willing to share ur experiences? Shouldnt be older than 5 years and being good available on european eBay or similar platforms :-) I appreciate any tip!

It is very text-heavy and can be boring, making it hard for beginners to grasp the concepts because they are presented in an abstract way without practical scenarios. And this way is hard to learn and make things stick.
 So if you know project learning resource that you can share I would appreciate.

 I began learning marketing from Chris on howtomarketagame.com.

 Been a while since I did anything serious in C++ but I've got about 2+ years of Rust under my belt, and done some FFI into C/C++ as well. I have a decent idea of ptrs/C memory layout etc, but always learning everyday!
 And that's where I'm looking for your advice please:
  
Do you have a go to Cpp starter?
 I code on Mac, Linux but I use Win/WSL & Ubuntu as well + VSCode / NeoVim / Zellij and Fish/OhMyFish/Atuin etc. for a nice dev flow.
 I'll most likely be doing some FFI stuff with Rust and protoc etc.
  
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent years of my life crafting a delicate balance between strategic decisions in our board games and trying to add layers of depth and interaction. This clearly shows that is not what the larger market wants. I understand they have the Monopoly brand and millions in user acquisition money, but the gameplay itself is just abysmal. They already have billions of players that know and love Monopoly rules, and yet they chose to throw those out the window and make a simple copy of coinmaster, rolling dice and earning money. And they are clearly spectacularly successful in doing so. As digital tabletop game designers, how do we process this? Granted this is the casual mobile market and not the hobby gaming market, but I'm still shocked that it is so addictive and profitable while using an IP originally from the hobby gaming world. Is the simple idle game really the pinnacle of mobile board gaming?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey good people! I've been programming for 12 years or so, some c++ and java but mostly js and python. 
 I feel like I have a good grasp of the basic language, but there's a gap between me and someone who writes systems software professionally. I have a long term goal of contributing to CPython, as well as understanding the machine on a deeper level.
 So i'd like to know, what could take me from just knowing the syntax to being a 'C programmer'? In particular:
 Any good places to learn the history and best practices of the language? Is there a bible for c, or good places for news?
 where does one find c programmers online? Where are the water holes?
 As someone interested in really the whole machine (not just python interp), any good next steps? I've been told building a terminal might be good.
 Many thanks!

In over a year, I have applied to over 1,100 jobs and gotten no interviews. Not a single one. I started working as an after school teacher / tutor after not being able to get a software engineering job a few months after graduating. It doesn't pay very much though, I'm on the brink of homelessness and I can't find anything better.
 As dumb as it sounds I've known I wanted to be a programmer since I started coding as a kid and found that I genuinely love it. The promise from adults of getting a good programming job if I just work hard has literally been the only thing keeping me going throughout my life up until now. Lot's of schoolwork?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 My management thinking about to create a company wide centralized CICD workflows (like build, deploy, testing, releases ect.). That sounds fair, and I support that, but we use different tools for some projects like most of the projects using Gitlab for everything and some of the projects uses Jenkins (and ArgoCD) and the last group is a Github Actions based only.
 So we are asked to create the workflows to run every possible CICD platform.
 It is possible? My first thought was that to use docker images with built-in shell scripts (maybe some environment variable checking or setup is needed but), after these everything can be used from anywhere.
 Have you any other idea?

 int v = fun(2,2);
 Something like this. In kernel I want to load just a fun and start executing. Do you know how to compile a single C file without linking and where will be the first byte of the fun. (and what if there is more than one fun)

 }
 in the above program when num1 is taking input, i wrote a character 'L' instead of an integer/floating point number.
 this is what im getting as output:
 Enter a double value: l
 Enter a double value: Enter +, -, *, or /: Enter valid operator!
 when i checked on chatgpt it say it is an example of input stream in a fail state. I tried to understand this concept on internet but i cant find any solution to my question. please help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently reading a previously to me unfamiliar codebase. There are a lot of functions that basically do the following:
 std::unique_ptr<SomeSmallType> getSomething() { return std::make_unique<SomeSmallType>(); } 
 What might be reasons for this? Why don't we just return the type directly and instead wrap it in a unique_ptr? I get that it makes sense to do this with massive types that might otherwise blow up the Stack, but these types are rather small (Something around 2 ints and a std::string maybe). Does this pattern have a name?

 I screwed up. In hindsight, I should've immediately asked for a range.
 Edit: This is a small company, so I can't research the range for this specific company, and the range can be huge in theory. This company is also located in a state that does not practice pay transparency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I graduated in 2023 and have been working as a software developer at a high-frequency trading firm for about a year. The pay is good, slightly better than what FAANG companies offer locally, and the workload is reasonable (45-50 hours per week). However, I've been feeling somewhat adrift for the past few months.
 My current role mainly involves maintenance and resolving production tickets, which isn't as fulfilling as working on new projects. I love when I am assigned tasks which are thought provoking and needs good development design, but opportunities for this seem limited at my current company, where the team is small and mostly senior.
 I have made a good foundation in Linux, networking, and C++ compilers, and I'm passionate about modern C++ and systems software. I also have a keen interest in the finance sector. Despite my current dissatisfaction, I'm hesitant to leave my job due to the unstable job market, and I acknowledge that it is a good position overall.
 I’m reaching out to ask for advice on skills I should develop, projects I could undertake, or potential career paths that could help me find more fulfillment and alignment with my interests. Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
 TL;DR: Love modern c++, no interesting projects at work, bad job market, how to explore interesting C++ projects.

 The first is just for a static site for a local business in my town and the site I built just went live. So I'm pretty pumped. Not only that, but after the site went live, the business is now asking me to help them with some of their clients websites moving forward so I'm hoping it's consistent work. 
 The second is for a Java dev that wants me to build a website that'll host their app they are working on. This will be more in depth and require setting up a database, user creation, authentication, and payment processing. 
 I would have never landed these gigs without my friends' connections. To get a programming job, learning to program is important (duh). But if you are struggling to break into the industry don't forget to leverage your network as well. You might not get a full time role this way, but who knows, maybe they know someone that needs help with their small local business or project. 
 I hope that I get to see more posts about people landing roles - big or small!

 My reason to do this is to give my users the extra peace of mind that the system at its core has not been modified, it uses debian stable kernel and debian packages from the official repo. I also made sure to let everyone know that the 'distro' is really a debian stable platform with minor cosmetic tweaks and some accesibility preconfigured things

The 4 teams under my skip manager own framework/platform that affects or depends on multiple different orgs and hundreds of engineers. We also are going through an entire rearchitecture that is requiring a lot of coordination with these other orgs.
 Because of that, I’ve slowly found myself more and more doing less direct tech work. I spend most of my time in meetings with other teams, product, or leadership, and writing documents for these meetings.
 I still am the technical representative and many of the documents are technical in part, but everything is very high level. I do some proof of concepts where I do write code, but otherwise it is common for there to be weeks where I don’t push out a CR to my team. 
 I am not a staff+ engineer and I don’t feel quite qualified to be one yet, but I also am feeling myself losing some of the lower level tech skills. Im not interested in moving towards people management or business roles (at this time at least). 
 I’m starting to look for a new job around the senior level, but I’m a bit conflicted about leveling and technical concerns in my interview. Especially so since I feel like my company is already less technical by default. Do you feel like this is a long term concern? Or is it enough to just keep up with system design practice and leetcode in my free time and learn on the new job?

 I worked hard to make games playable on such a small screen. The arrows are arranged in an inverted T shape to take up as little space as possible.There is also a hold/sustain feature for the A and B buttons (it works a bit like voice messages on Telegram).
 The resolution for Game Boy (Color) games is 2x the original on all Apple Watches. For Game Boy Advance games, the resolution depends on the screen width. Since the resolution isn't precise and images appeared blurry, I created an anti-aliasing shader.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I am currently working on a side project that uses WPF with MVVM. I use the CommunityToolkit’s ObservableProperty annotation to make properties available for the view(s). Now, one of my ViewModels has quite a few properties that I would like to be initialized without blocking the UI thread (and just show some loading indicator), so I was thinking of running these via TPL. These include simple values like ints and bools, but also more complex Model objects. I already tried this and did not encounter any problems, which I find confusing since some properties (such as ObservableCollections) require dispatching the work to the owner thread. In this case I do not have any ObservableCollections.
 Could someone point me to documentation, or help explain to me, the restrictions and why some objects can be initialized and assigned on different threads? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been learning programming for a few months now, and I just realized that whenever I needed to use a library, I simply added it to my project and started using it without a second thought.
 It never occurred to me that when I run a function from a library, I'm essentially executing code someone else wrote on my own machine, which could potentially be malicious.
 I guess most of the time it doesn't matter because popular libraries are exposed to many eyes, but I'm a bit surprised that the potential risks aren't mentioned anywhere (at least not that I've seen).

 Apologies that this question has been asked before - I've read through many of the posts on this subreddit, so I'll try to make mine more specific. I understand the pros and cons of singletons, and I've seen the Double-Checked Locking Pattern as well as Meyer's Singleton in C++11 and forward (which I prefer, for simplicity).
 I'm open to debate on singletons as a design pattern, but more or less I believe they are useful in game-engines and games themselves.
 My question is about which subsystems they should be used in specifically. Which game subsystems should be singletons? Can you make a strong argument that they shouldn't be used at all?
 I'll assume for the moment that an engine-editor is outside the scope of this post, and we're just talking about an engine.

I want to use it for development purposes and have a habit of running and testing a lot things locally. One of my most important criteria for the OS, is to be in control over every single thing that is (being) installed - I will take responsibility for which version it is, all I need to be told by the package manager is which dependencies there are (and sometimes be able to break them).

 My main language is Python, but I know the basis of many other languages (C, C++, JavaScript, HTML5, Julia, Rust, Lua, Bash, etc.)
 COmpared to other languages, I'm finding Go rather verbose, with many piece of codes that must be repeated multiple times due to minor variations. This is partially due to the static typing nature, but I think that good libraries may come in hand to make the code less repetitive.
 So, go with your advice!

 You might have seen my previous posts, and if you did you might be glad to know I finally solved the kattis problem that has been consuming me for too long, but now I am free! Here it is if you wanna give it a try yourself. The final piece of the puzzle was to realize that the numbers can get enormous and will require some sort of BigInt to handle. 
 However, I am only sharing my standard int-based solution. If you could give me some advice on how to improve I would appreciate that! Any tips are appreciated, so things like how I organize the code or use out-of-date functions/practices, coding style, naming, etc. Anything that looks like rookie coding or obvious mistakes, I wanna know, but for that matter if you see something you think I did well I would also like to know. I want this to be a learning experience. Here is my code.

So I was wondering if others think this would be a good idea to have sections that define the default. I'm genuinely curious whether I'm missing something, that would make this useless or a terrible idea.
 The idea I have is:
 default_section example_default { some syntax to define defaults for: functions, classes, variables i.e: functions have return type auto by default. } default_section : example_default { // Apply example_default to anonymous default section foo() {...}; // This function is has return value type auto by default. void bar() {...}; // Explicitly overrides the default return type. }

So in july 2022 I had interviews with Google (final round canceled cuz the hiring freezes started), amazon (final round failed because i sucked at system design), uber, tiktok, Bloomberg. This was at 1 YOE for me for SDE 1 roles.
 I didn't even apply back then in 2022, the recruiters would reach out. RTX (Raytheon) once quadruple messaged me on LinkedIn begging me to apply back then in 2022. This week after I applied they rejected me.
 Now I got laid off at vmware, and its just crickets. SDE 2 jobs are requiring 3 yoe instead of 2 now and there are no SDE 1 jobs available. I am also currently doing OMSCS at UT Austin so ik i have a strong application but its just totally fucked.
 Companies would rather take a developer with 6 yoe at Albertsons than an strong early career dev. Experience does matter a great deal, but so does a rigorous education/previous employers. Having worked @ no name before and being one of the the best python devs as an intern, I can say that 3-6 months of experience at a top tier is equivalent to 1 year at a average company.
 I know multiple people with ~2-3 yoe @ Tier 1 companies with real Research based CS masters degrees from Georgia tech, Upenn, etc... who are unemployed/have been unemployed for months

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now, I get that many programmers consider SQL to be too simple and noobish to be even considered a programming language. But of all languages, I think SQL stands out as not only one of the easiest to learn and practice, the sheer genius of this language is that it lets you do so much with so little expressiveness, while still trying to maintain standards across various kinds of databases as much as possible.
 With all their expressive tokens and syntaxes, languages like C and Java and Python are often appreciated and rightly so, but I think SQL also deserves a place up there in the list of "do more with less jargon" things out there. In fact, the four basic DML/DDL statements (create, insert, update, delete) are all you need to get started with creating tables and manipulating data on most projects. And learning additional features like alter, drop, truncate, etc. is both fun and interesting.
 And once you go even further with things like stored procedure and triggers, the real fun then begins! If you consider the below stored procedure of some hypothetical SQL dialect, it is no less elegant than any of the other popular expressive languages like Python or Ruby, don't you agree?
 create or replace procedure foo: begin select @test = select foo from bar; -- statement 2; -- statement 2; -- statement 3; end;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an app in which different categories of errors can occur. For example file IO errors, UI errors (errors in user input or output), etc.
 I'm currently avoiding exceptions as much as possible and handling them only when a library function can throw.
 I'm only working with std::errc and std::error_condition. These are returned from functions.
 The problem is that there are a finite number of distinct POSIX error enumerators in std::errc. Sometimes it makes sense to use one of these enumerators in UI functions and then I realize that another function from File handling module is using that same enumerator to report an error condition.
 I don't think this collision is harmless. Is it?
 What strategy is appropriate to avoid this collision?
 Should I define an error_category for each module (file IO, UI, etc) and construct the std::error_conditions using those customs categories instead of always using std::generic_category?

 So we are shifting to OnPrem for some reason. For this we want to deploy PostgreSQL database on premise. What should be the best way to deploy this? Should we consider deploying in Kubernetes or as docker containers or direct installation using virtualization software's which you know will be present.
 I am thinking of a stack for kubernetes:
 Rancher
 KubeDB
 Cloudflare
 Prometheus
 Stash
 Thing is replication is also important and Cloudflare for tunneling.
 Any recommendations
 P.S Might migrate other postgres databases to onprem also

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been doing Fiverr freelancing for two years with a half year break at the start of this year. I do prototypes for games, so I basically code the fuctionality my buyers want so they can then make a game off of the prototype themselves. It's more for saving other developers' time and helping them get started rather than make a full game for them. Most of the requests I receive on Fiverr tend to be very ambitious that usually require a team of people to work on them instead of just one person, which usually leads to me declining and explaining that I'm unable to make something like that in a reasonable timeframe as one man. I also separately have in my description that I only make prototypes, so they generally don't include finished environments or animations (unless it's crucial for the prototype or if it helps to visualize the functionality better). Still, I get a ton of requests via dms to make almost a full game with animations, environments, and even some triple A game mechanics, which tends to take too much time or is too ambitious for what's reasonable for an indie developer. I generally try to limit the time I spend on a single order to 1-3 weeks depending on how complex it is but a lot of the requests I get would take at least a few months to make if I only were to focus on that specific order which is impossible since I tend to have other orders I'm working on at the same time. I'm just here to complain because it tends to get frustrating at times since these types of requests seem to be almost half of the dms I receive on Fiverr. Can other freelancers here relate and how do you deal with it?

 Code src: https://github.com/IamSanjid/memory_pool/
 You would be probably interested in this 346 lines of file. The .cpp file is not much interesting as it just mostly follows the paper's implementation. But the linux perf tool showed benchmarks/perf1.cpp spends the most time on these two functions which is accepted but I am not sure if it's there spending some unexpected amount of time just syscalling: FixedPool::ForcedAllocate and FixedPool::ForcedDeAllocate
 The main issue is my implementation seems to spend too much time on syscalls. And tbf I really don't have any idea about the total memory model of my implementation.
 Any kind of suggestions would be helpful well it's code-review, I am ready to face criticism. Syntax, design-decision anything. Thanks!
 Some contextes:
 Long story short that paper just describes an idea where fixed-sized pre-allocated memory might be better for constantly allocated and deallocated objects.
 I just tried to extend it with features like: some sort of thread safety, creating "new" fixed-sized-pool when the last pool is full...
 My idea was simple use lock-free queue for "thread-safe" deallocation.
 Use thread_local for per thread allocation.
 And bad c++ template magic to abstract away the API calls.
 Regarding the syscall issue:
 Wrote a few small naive benchmarking programs for posix/linux platforms. If anybody has time to check it out a gcc compiler with c++ 20 support can build on a linux platform. benchmarks/build_benchmark.bash will download google's benchmark library and build it, otherwise one can edit it to just build the small programs which can be used with linux specific profiling tools gprof/perf(recommended to remove the -pg flag).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I joined a new company 6 months ago and the tech stack and business area was different for me. Day 1, I am assigned a large migration project with a sharp deadline. I am assigned a buddy but he is busy in another migration. So, the help is rare and scarce. Anyways, I worked day and nights to complete the project on deadline. My boss says I have done a great job with the project being new yada yada.This was in march.
 1 months down the line, a bug came in one of the code. We find out, my code and all code upstream had to be changed. But, still a bug.
 Today, another bug was reported which resulted in some dups in the data. I had made some change in the code which to me at the time looked ok, but apparently wasn't. This prod issue was identified after 3 months in production.
 My boss called me as soon as he heard about the defect, and bashed me. Blaming me that I don't care about the job and ain't interested to work. I have had too many mistakes and things can't go on this way. When I asked what was the business impact of the issue, he clarified there was NONE because that file was internal and isn't used anywhere. When I pointed code there was no code review or QA, essentially my self tested code was deployed to production-- duh.... The whole project was rushed because of the time deadline. He said he understands that but I am still responsible for my code.And, how great our team is that there is no blame culture.
 Any advice on how to salvage this situation?
 For background, my boss is from a research background if it matters. This isn't FAANG or any of the tech companies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently I use Conan for managing dependencies, as it was the package manager that supported the main dependencies of the program I’m developing. However, some libraries require other build managers or have cmakelists that don’t work with add_subfolder. In order to use them, I precompile those libraries as static or dynamic libraries (depending on the size and their update frequency) and then I link them using target_link_libraries. The entire build process is automated using a makefile.
 As a result, the project is not as clean and easy to maintain as I would like. Therefore, I’m looking for a package manager that can handle the building process itself, without requiring to call cmake (even if it doesn’t provide some of the libraries I use. It would also be nice if it could execute some custom shell commands before or after each stage of the building process to avoid using make (as an example, if I need to compile a library not provided by that package manager, it would be great if I could specify a the commands it should execute to achieve that in each platform, so they could be executed before compiling the program). 
 Basically, I’d like to replace make, conan, cmake and ninja by a single software in new programs (something like cargo), while being able to call whatever was used (cmake, scons, Conan, vcpkg…) when building legacy libraries
 Do you know if there’s something like that available for C++? Every package manager I’ve checked requires using cmake
 Edit: I forgot to clarify that it needs to support cross platform development (I need to be able to support at least Linux and windows, as we don’t use apple computers)

 enum Enum e; struct Struct s; // or class Struct s class Class c; // or struct Class c union Union u; ```
 So I don't specify struct or class since that can cause compiler warnings if the tags mismatch but I do specify enum and unions before my enums to be more specific.
 is it bad practise?
 EDIT: because like I see some conventions like EType denotes an enum why do that instead of putting the enum tag instead?
 enum EState; // why not enum State; and use enum State state instead?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Unsure if this is the correct flair)
 After having built a 3D bullet hell in GDScript, spending almost as much time doing optimizations as I spent on programming the prototype, and now building a similar prototype in C# using the physics / rendering server...I can't think of any reason to NOT statically type your GDScript code.
 Static typing not only makes it significantly easier to debug but has notable performance boosts across the board. As someone who comes from a Java/C++ background, I also personally feel it brings *a bit* more professional credibility to GDScript as a language.
 I did a side-by-side optimization comparison test that directly accesses the Physics/Rendering 3D server to create 3000 bullets in GDScript and C#. Statically typed GDScript was only about 10% FPS slower than the C# version.
 Yet the overwhelming majority of YouTube tutorials and code posted on this subreddit use dynamically typed GDScript. Any particular reason why static typing isn't the default when it only appears to have benefits over dynamically typed GDScript?
 Curious on everyone's thoughts - for those programming in GDScript , do you enforce static typing in your code?
 UPDATE:
 Thanks to everyone for your input and insight! Didn't realize the subject of static typing was so polarizing.
 For anyone interested, here is the github link to the optimization test using the PhysicsServer3D and RenderingServer to spawn 3000 objects, written in static typed GDScript:

 I'm one of the organisers of Scientific Computing in Rust, a free online annual workshop/conference for people interested in doing scientific computing in Rust. All the information about the workshop is can be found at https://scientificcomputing.rs/.
 If you're interested in giving a talk at the workshop, you can submit something at https://scientificcomputing.rs/submit-talk. The deadline is today, but we can probably accept a few late submissions. We're also planning to run a longer tutorial session where attendees can pick from a few sessions which to attend. If you think your software would be suitable for one of these tutorials let me know.

 I personally think the error messages are way better readable if I create them with fmt.Sprintf()
  log.Info(fmt.Sprintf("foobar %s", s)) 
 I would like to do the above, but somehow I think I am on the wrong track.
 I like log = log.WithValues("foo", foo) but the actual message is mostly not a fixed string in my case.
 I think log.Infof() would be nice.

 I’ve been working on a .NET C# application that runs on a Service Fabric cluster for a while now. While Service Fabric has been a solid platform for us, I've noticed a decline in the amount of new content, discussions, and updates related to it recently. This has made me wonder about the current state of the Service Fabric community.
 I'm curious to know if others in the community are experiencing the same. Are you still actively using Service Fabric for new projects, or have you moved on to other platforms like Kubernetes or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)? Are there any active forums, blogs, or resources you follow for the latest Service Fabric news and updates?
 Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences.
 Thanks!

 Currently i am a software engineer working on Python and AWS Cloud services. I want to move my career towards Game development or at least try to publish a game on steam or the play store even. If anyone has ever made the jump or published a game as a Solo dev can they share their experience?
 Because my major problem is after work hours i barely have any will left to do any work. I tried working on a Monopoly game in Godot ( as its coding language is basically python lol ) but much to my dismay it never came to completion.
 Would love to hear how a few solo developers managed to push out their first game along side their job of possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s difficult to argue with the idea that being likeable and sociable improves the chances of a successful career in tech. Nonetheless, life is maybe not always perfect, and some mistakes can happen in the interview process, and company hires someone less than ideal.
 I’m curious to hear stories from others about working with someone who seemed like they were not the most well-mannered. Especially if it was at big tech or a more senior level position. How did it affect your work? Did you end up quitting and looking for a new job? Working things out? Ousting them somehow lol?

I've been cramming so much study that the other day I looked at what I was trying to do and it was like hieroglyphics lol. I couldn't remember things I learned the day before. 
 Anyway, I took an easy day and then when I got back to it, its like it started making sense again. Coding feels like magic when I'm learning. I'm creating something. Those little aha! moments as you press the green button and it all works are incredible! 
 I kind of shot myself in the foot in the beginning because I was barely practicing. But since I've been ending every lesson with 2-3 mini projects its been going very well. I cant wait to see where all be in a month and going on! 
 If you have any tip or advice for a newbie I would greatly appreciate it. My hardest sections are anything involving math. I can do it but I dread it lmao. I struggle with retaining what I learn to and would love to know some tips to deal with it.

 I'm looking for similar channels who cover Java, Spring, Micronaut, and that sort of thing, with similar high quality presentation. Any I should be taking a look at?

 As moderators of r/archlinux, we feel that it's important to occasionally check in with the community regarding the state and direction of the subreddit, and to make any changes (or not changes) necessary to make it a happier, healthier, and more productive place.
 So, we ask that anyone who wishes to share their thoughts to take some time to think about what is going well, and what can be better.
 To that end, we do have some guidelines that we ask be kept in mind:
  
r/archlinux should make its best effort to keep discourse polite
 r/archlinux should make its best effort to serve those who have various needs, various interests, various skill levels, and various reasons for using Arch
 Please consider the changing landscape of computing in 2024 and beyond. (We wish to be prepared for an influx of newer users in the wake of AI, privacy concerns, advancements in Linux gaming, and other things as they develop)
  
Over the coming weeks, the Moderators will make a number of posts regarding some things we want to get a beat on (one topic at a time), and we'll include any community suggestions that are particularly popular or impactful as well.
 Community suggestions can be made as a response to this post...
 We'll be back in a few days with our first discussion item.
 We thank you for your attention and contribution,
 r/archlinux Mod Team.

At time same time, windows is making a privacy shitshow by pulling random stunts and gimmicks. I think this should be a good selling point for Linux to make more space in the market so more new people start using it. If game development etc starts and there is good steam supported games in Linux, it actually can be daily drived by many people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been learning Go for the past few weeks on LinkedIn Learning and I'm HOOKED. I thought it would be fun to build a tiny command line tool. I've been using tools like btop, fastfetch and lazygit so why not take a shot at creating something else?
 This is the result of running cmdtop, or, command top:
 Top 12 commands: 1: ls (51) 2: cd (47) 3: vi (28) 4: yay (20) 5: go (15) 6: sudo (11) 7: clear (9) 8: tmux (8) 9: clear (8) 10: ff (7) 11: lazygit (7) 12: git (7) 
 The format is: Rank, Command, Number of uses. (I'm on a new machine, by the way)
 You can also type cmdtop -top 5 to list your top 5 commands, instead.
 This project is complete with a README, tests, GitHub Actions, and GoReleaser which will automatically cross-compile cmdtop when a new tag is created.
 Contributions welcome, if you're also beginning Go!!
 Looking to support bash and fish, too. It's just a matter of implementing a Parser interface to create an array of Command models which is then sorted and printed. Also, looking for a more creative way of displaying top commands... in a more stylish fashion. If there are any other interesting flags that should be included, those are welcome too!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am 0MQ newbie, I have a server application that should connect to multiple clients. There are two scenarios:
 1) The server sends to specific clients commands to be executed. For instance, Server sends to Client_1a command to print a message and then return to the server an status. The status can be returned asynchronously.
 2) The clients send continuously telemetry to the server and the server stores it in a DB.
 I was thinking to have two sockets for each task. I believe that both scenarios should be Route/Req, but I don't understand how to force 1:1 communication for command execution. Or, for commands execution I should use a PUB/SUB pattern with one specific topic for each client?
 What advice can you provide to me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading an article about safe vs. unsafe languages and have a question about the following part:
 “C and C++ are unsafe in a strong sense: executing an erroneous operation causes the entire program to be meaningless, as opposed to just the erroneous operation having an unpredictable result. In these languages erroneous operations are said to have undefined behavior. The C FAQ defines “undefined behavior” like this: Anything at all can happen; the Standard imposes no requirements. The program may fail to compile, or it may execute incorrectly (either crashing or silently generating incorrect results), or it may fortuitously do exactly what the programmer intended.” (https://blog.regehr.org/archives/213)
 It says “Anything at all can happen.” My question is what are some examples of anything? Because I take it this means something as potentially insidious as there being virtually no correspondence between the original logic of the program and what it is actually doing.

You will be spam called by Indians (yes it's 100% Indians) multiple times a day (some at 6am) every weekday. I wish there was a law against this. It's honestly FAR WORSE than the car warranty scam calls. I got those calls much MUCH less
 Edit: I do love you Indian people. But it's literally ONLY Indians who are at this point harassing me daily. I have fellow IT friends who have the exact same problem. And as we see in the comments it seems to be pretty common. This is a problem that needs a solution. Nothing will probably come of it since they aren't explicitly scamming and it's probably only IT people getting these calls not everyone like the car warranty scams

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR; Silo’d into monitoring and debugging prod on my own in addition to dev work. It’s tiring and i’m trying to understand what monitoring should look like.
 For context, the majority of my career (4 YOE) has been spent working on internal facing apps where the desired “monitoring” has just been send a message in a Teams channel if something breaks. 
 I’m now with my first project that’s customer facing, and as we approached our go-live last year there was a last minute scramble to figure out how we were going to monitor prod. Myself and another dev ended up getting asked to monitor our apps for 2 weeks following the go-live. A year later, that dev has moved on but I’m still stuck monitoring our applications (granted I at least have a half decent Splunk dashboard now). 
 I gotta be honest, it’s really exhausting. When I find an issue, Im expected to do a write up consisting of finding the root cause and determining the impact, which is usually not a quick and easy task. And I wouldn’t be complaining too much if I wasn’t expected to continue to work cards as a developer as well. Lately I’ve been working 10-12 hours days just to keep up with the workload. I’m tired. 
 This isn’t normal, is it? The seniors and leads above me acknowledge it’s a bad solution, but project management is fine with it for the most part. I’m struggling to find a way out of this, conversations about getting help have gone no where and any efforts I’ve made towards off loading this have been ignored. I understand I could take the initiative to learn Splunk best practices, but I genuinely do not have the energy to take that on. Should monitoring fall on a single developer, should it be a shared effort amongst a dev team? Or are there other roles that typically handle this?
 Apologies for the rambling and thank you for reading.

Which approach would be more typical for this situation?

I graduated as a senior with 3 YOE and as an SRE working fully remote.
 2021 was a wild job market. I'm super mediocre as well. I feel bad because nearly all of you who are struggling would've crushed it in 2021/2022.

 Trigger warning of harassment 
 I 20f am a game designer, I own my own company and I have my own team, I did marketing and negotiation when I was 18 and drop out of community collage, I’m now a game designer heading for a bachelor degree in 2 years. In half a year, learn the hardship of being a woman in a class dominated by men and now i wonder will it always be this way?
 In my own class rooms I don’t feel safe, men have harassed me, a guy got close to me face to face wise and put his hand down his pants to you know where while keeping eye contact with me. I had men who I’m supposed to work with on projects leave me out and call me a “sim player.” (Reference to girls only playing the sims) I had men get angry at me when I help them with there coding or nodes. I been followed and insulted, I been cat called by classmates too. Now it’s not just the men but also the woman too, as a woman who likes coding, video games, etc. it was kinda difficult to find other female friend who liked what I liked, but now I’m too scared to talk to any of them. I had girl say she doesn’t like girly girly with purses, meaning me bc I like my purse (it has a corgi on it)on the first day she was boasting about how she the only woman in a class of men, I have short hair plus I want keeping to myself at the time, but she said that she was happy she was the only woman because other woman are too girly for her, when the professor pointed me out, let’s just say the death glare was definitely felt. I had girls that dismiss me and try to talk over me. and girls who see me as competition in the class and try to one up me on stuff.
 I have heard stories of woman in the industry having problems with getting jobs, coworkers, and work. I won’t lie I thought it never happen to me and that I’ll make friends with my peers but I was wrong. I’m not giving up my degree so I wonder, will it always be like this?

 I'm a British A Level student and for my exams I need to produce some software. I have decided to produce a virtual graphical calculator, similar to the Casio FX-CG50 if you are familiar. It will function as a regular scientific calculator and have the ability to plot functions on a graph.
 While I am certain I will be using C#, I am not sure as to which graphical engine I will make it on. Windows Forms, Windows WPF and Monogame are ones which I have heard of but I am not familiar with any of these and I was wondering what would be optimal for the project I am attempting. Also if there are other options please let me know

On YouTube, I often see people using the same name for instances and classes, like this: `var car = new Car();`. The only difference is the capitalization of the first letter, which makes it very easy to mix them up. Why not use a different name? A simple prefix or suffix, like `myCar` or `instCar`, would suffice. Why is this behavior so common, and why isn't it frowned upon?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joined a new job recently. Wasn't excited to join since I took it coming off a layoff. From what I've seen: 
  
this company is really only using lambas in the backend layer (apparently coming from a larger monolith, but everything is just being broken down into just lambdas). 
 There's over 1000 of these, from what I can see, and it's hard to know how each of these interact with each other.
 Also using nano-frontends as well, but our team doesn't really touch those
 
 Local dev environments are extremely hard to set up (with said lambdas), and sometimes the only way to test things are to push to a shared staging environment (before pushing to pre-prod)
 Everything is in javascript (even the backend). No TS, no frameworks or DI, just pure javascript.
  
And some other things I've noticed:
  
Jira tickets are not well defined. I don't know where the PMs are but tickets have no AC, just "do this thing" without any context 
 Also don't really see any test plans written out for these tickets
 
 "Teams" are not well defined, but there's lots of them. Seems like our team is taking on tickets that are for other teams (or other teams just kinda dump them on us, which is a legacy team from what I'm gathering) 
 And it seems the engineers are the ones who have to really push back. Again I don't know where the EMs or PMs are with this (I suspect they're just super stretched thin)
 
 Thank god there are some unit tests, but I don't know how strong our E2E suite is on pre-prod.
  
There's a bunch of other things I'm learning about the ecosystem (such as SDK management and manual upgrading of packages) and I'm sure more gems that I haven't seen yet.
 I'm just wondering if this is more of a new normal for medium sized companies or if there's more red flags than yellow here.

 Been working on (but never actually completing one) Gamemaker projects from time to time since I first bought the 1.6 version on Steam back in 2015, then buying the permanent license for GMS2 when it came out.
 Having no actual coding/software background was the primary reason I never worked on any of those projects for more than 2-3 months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently joined a small company as an engineering manager. I have 20+ years of experience in the field and have been a manager prior. I am managing a team of 4 mobile developers.
 My boss is the head of engineering. Every time I have met with him he has NEVER has anything good to say about my team. He always tells me how shitty they are, and never had highlighted any of the strengths. 
 The thing is, they have all been with the company for years and are well liked. Our product is making money. Their salaries are admittedly under market rate and WELL within the budget. I asked my boss for previous performance reviews for each employee and he said, "oh we don't do that here". As far as I can tell, they have never made any major fumbles. They all work hard and most of them put in extra hours without asking.
 I took the approach of "let me coach them and work with them on the areas they can improve". I am a big fan of the "coach" role as a manager and that has always worked well for me in the past. My boss however, doesn't want any of that shit. My general vibe is that he is just a very negative person and never has anything good to say about anyone. I can count on one hand the number of times I have seen him smile.
 So basically, I am sticking up for my team and I haven't joined in on the pity party. This has already put me on the outs with him. I'm pretty sure he didn't want anyone to actually lead or manage, but just someone who could join in with his bitch fest. 
 His skip level is the CEO and the CEO is completely checked out. I've pretty much hit a brick wall with this guy already as he seems to just dislike everyone in general. Any advice on how to salvage this situation?

 My employer has a CLI tool with which we do various stuff like re-authenticating to our k8s cluster, and a bunch more. I noticed our platform team hasn't guided the devs to periodically update the tool. So I figured: let's find out how.
 Here's what worked (I am replacing the private repo names with employer):
  
git config --global url."ssh://git@github.com/employer/".insteadOf "https://github.com/employer/"
 go env -w GOPRIVATE="github.com/employer/employer-cli"
 go install github.com/employer/employer-cli/cmd/employer@latest (this path is where the main.go file is)
  
And I have the tool in my $GOPATH/bin and can run it.
 Bonus points: install a helpful update tool like https://github.com/nao1215/gup and then run gup update periodically (I have it in my system-wide upgrade script that I run almost every day) and you'll have the internal CLI tool updated every time the authors publish a new release.
 Or you can manually run the go install ... incantation from above periodically as well.
 If you feel like it, share if this worked for you. But I thought I'd contribute because almost all my searches only resulted in "how to go get from a private repo" which is not exactly the same. This article helped me the most: https://www.golinuxcloud.com/import-private-repos-golang/
 Anyhow, cheers, and happy Go-ing!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My new team goes beyond the current document-nothing fashion:
 They actively resist. When I review a PR and suggest, "Let's document the intent of this non-obvious code block", responses are either, "No, comments go out of sync.", or "How about in the wiki?" 🤡
 The staff coders have been heavily influenced by expensive contractors who do things their company way.
 One bright point is that we're group-reading influential programming texts. They each hit on documentation, how and when. So I'm hopeful that this will change the culture.
 Any other ideas? It's frustrating.
 I wonder when this trend started. Where did it come from? Maybe Clean Coding? Except in that book (which I loved) code comments are to be avoided only if the code is self-documenting. I.e., not as extreme as codebases I see which have zero comments for complex, opaque code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been working on a small data structures library and recently finished writing the main code for it. This was my first multi file project in c snd so I want to organize it like how actual projects on GitHub are organized and use a build system for it. Since I’d mostly heard about Cmake being popular, I decided to learn how to use Cmake
 However, as I try to understand how to structure my project and use Cmake, I keep on getting more and more lost. I've seen many tutorials on the internet but they all have different methods of going about it and, till now, I haven’t found any tutorial that explains how to properly structure a library and use it with Cmake
 There are many terms in cmake that I fail to understand (such as target, static, public etc) and I don’t even think I understand the use of cmake. I thought a build system was used to compile our code in a simpler, more organized way but what I’m reading is that Cmake is a build system that builds build systems? I know how headers files, object code, linkers, etc work but I don’t understand how they work with Cmake 
 Overall these are my main questions:
 How to structure a C project(specifically a library)?
 What is a build system?
 How Cmake works?
 How to build a library with Cmake?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I‘m currently in a fucky situation where we are supposed to govern, create and maintain standardized CI/CD jobs for ~700 devs, infra automation engineers, devops engineers etc. in an oldschool-ish org in the financial sector. The scope is on-prem and in the cloud, so multiple tenants as well.
 Most engineers can‘t be arsed to do shit themselves: - they buy software which needs to run on the container platform but they have nobody to take care of the release management, they come ask us - they ramp-up product teams with deadlines but don‘t have the staff with the necessary knowledge, they come ask us - they don‘t have the justification for hiring a full time devops engineer because the product is relatively small, they come to us - they don‘t care, they come to us - we racked up massive tech debt, so shit breaks all the time because we were trying to „enable“ engineers resistant to learning, they of course come ask us
 The idea to prevent us from drowning and do our actual job would be to ramp-up a team which just takes care of these operative tasks for other teams and offer it as-a-service.
 Thank you for listening to my rant

 I am an indie game developer.
 Four years ago I released my first PC game called Dorky Fork. I tried to do some marketing. Posted gifs on twitter and reddit. The best post garnered 25k upvotes on reddit, which led to about 200 wishlists on Steam.
 The game sold fewer than 100 copies. It was pretty obscure and hard puzzle game, nobody really cared for it. But one of the prominent game critics and journalists John Walker wrote about it on his site Buried Treasure, where he reviewed indie games. I am really greatful for his review. Also, one Twitch streamer Sabadass streamed the whole walkthrough for 5 hours right after the release. This was highlight of my whole indie career.

 One of them highly emphasized the importance of AI. Granted, AI and LLMs have many use cases, but I can't understand why the average backend engineer would need AI/neural networks/deep learning knowledge. Then I see article after article about new AI startups and companies shipping new AI products. Even Logitech is now releasing a mouse that incorporates an AI button. 
 I'm starting to think that while AI is important, it's now been thrown around as a buzzword because it's "cool". Am I wrong or not seeing something? 
 PS: I only have three years of experience.

 I’ve compiled everything from my 2-year journey with Rust into a cheat sheet. It’s become indispensable for me and might be helpful for you too.
 Rust SpeedSheet: link
 Features:
  
Interactive search: Just type what you need, and it pulls up the relevant info.
 Covers core Rust: Commands, syntax, and quick answers.
 Continuously improving: It’s not perfect and might be missing a few things, but it’s a solid resource.
  
The sheet is interactive and covers core Rust. Just type what you want into the search and it pulls up the relevant answer.
 I use it any time I'm coding Rust for quick lookups and to find answers fast. Hope you find it as useful as I do!
 Enjoy!
 TLDR:
 I created an interactive cheat sheet for Rust: link

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All my developer journey I ignored endianness, thinking it was some kind of "low-level protocols".
 Now I want to figure out exactly what endianness affects.
 So, here are the conclusions I've come to:
  
BE:LE does NOT affects struct/class fields layout. If i declare type with two int fields - for structs ctor'ed in methods, they are positioned accordingly on stack, or for classes - on heap after VMT pointer (of course there can be some padding or optimisation from CLR, but in general - it is true).
 BE:LE does NOT affects bit order.
 In general BE:LE does NOT affects process' virtual adress space. Oversimplifying, if I run the same programm under ideal conditions on BE and LE computers, the memory snapshot will look the same, except for primitive object fields, but objects positions and their layouts whould be the "same".
 BE:LE does affects only primitive types, i.e. Int16-64, double, float, unsigned types, and especially >1byte chars. Bool and byte for example doesn't affected bc of 1byte, also decimal doesn't affected, bc it is composite type.
  
I need someone to confirm/disprove my statements, because I'm a bit confused, given that I've always drawn a picture in my head of bytes going from left to right. And i know, in general it doesn't matter, but i just like to understand things.
 Thanks!

 At Dice, we try to distill the complex world of technology careers into actionable knowledge for technology professionals at each and every stage of their career. As the editor of our Career Advice section, I talk to engineers, developers, analysts, executives, and other folks all day about the tech job market and where things are going, and I’d love to share all of that with you.
 As all of you know, it’s a complicated time for the tech industry. Over the past year, some of the biggest names in tech have laid off tens of thousands of workers, sparking fears that hiring in the tech industry is weakening. Meanwhile, the rise of generative AI has left many developers and other tech professionals fearing that their jobs are at risk due to increasingly sophisticated automation. We’ll dig into these (and other) trends and break down what the data is really showing about the industry and job trends. I’ll also offer whatever data-driven career advice that I can!
 I’ll be answering your questions today from 9:00am to 5:00pm EST. AMA!

 Ive been trying to learn c# for a project for my job,
 its not essential, just an extra thing Im doing, my boss knows I like to code, so is fine with it.
 originally I wrote a winforms app in vb.net that shows details on the screen of things going on that we need to know. and to stop the PC its running on going to sleep, as their is a GPO to set sleep times, I found if I run a video on the form it stays awake, this lead to it been used as a video to show off internal stuff, nothing fancy,
 last two weeks, Ive been updating it to c#,
 Im interested in learning C# and it was a project I already knew how it would look, and act on the PC.
 got it all working, and now running, and while my PC was open source code over lunch, I came back to make some minor tweaks, like the position of items on the screen, and its got a couple of errors..
 complaining the WMPLib is missing.. its not its in the reference list,
 Ive been googling for about an hour, and all the ways to add the reference dont work, or dont even show the WMPLib as an option for adding it,
 has anyone else come accross this / know why I cant get it to work now..
 btw, I have a running version, right now on the PC in the office. just he source on mine, now wont compile or run because of this issue

 template<class T> class Something; template<class T> class Something<T()>{ MOCK_METHOD(T, func, (), (const); }; template<class T, class P1> class Something<T(P1)>{ MOCK_METHOD(T, func, (P1), (const); }; // etc 
 I think you might be knowing already where I am going at. We have, right now, 5 specializations for R() through R(P1-P5). I would love to get rid of the duplication and just use a variadic template:
 template<class T, class ... Args> class Something<T(Args...)>{ MOCK_METHOD(T, func, (Args...), (const); }; 
 But this doesn't seem to work! I get a static assertion: this method does not take 1 arguments. Parenthesize all types with unprotected commas.
 What am I missing exactly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I am currently working on improving our unit tests in one of our solutions.
 We have around 5000 unit tests, and in one test-project we have tests that runs slowly.
 I noticed that all test classes inherited the same base class. This base class had a huge constructor that did a lot of setups on our mocks.
 I went ahead and refactored to use Shared context in xUnit and removed the base class, and that greatly increased the speed of the tests.
 However..
 A lot of these tests used some helper methods defined inside of the previous base class. These helper method was responsible for setting up additional setups on the mocks.
 This led me to some issues when running the tests afterwards, as the unit test that called the helper method added some setups on the mock, that caused other tests to fail.
 All tests run when running one by one, but some fails when all are running.
 I have been thinking about ways of solving this, but got stuck.
 Ideally, it would be great if I can setup a mock to only be valid ONCE.
 Or find a way to reset some specific mocks after every method call, but I haven't found a way of doing this.
 Any ideas?

 The other engineers at my level have atleast 12 years experience and have been with this same company for years. The team is high performing and I have seen the engineers proactively take on project management work.
 I have been here 3 weeks and I am completely new to the stack, and my manager knows that. He however thinks I should be able to contribute at par with junior engineers by now. He also thinks I should ve answering questions from other engineers during stand-up, where most of the discussion stems from history of the project, which I have no information about.
 How have others survived this situation. This is my second jon ever and I dont know if this is normal?

 I tried doing what others say and starting my own project instead of doing endless tutorials and courses but I just cannot seem to do anything. I know nothing about making an app or website and all I can do is just a tic-tak-toe game in the terminal. I thought of making iOS apps and I did dedicate time to learning it but I am practically building nothing if I have 0 understanding of how to manage user data. An example is that I wanted to make a simple Instagram rip-off on an iPhone. However, I know nothing about how to allow users to upload stuff and have them displayed on other user's feeds. All I can do is like an empty canvas with some buttons. 
 I tried searching for tutorials for such topics but I literally cannot find anything useful. I am only a student and I have no money to pay for anything.

I tried making it a public string and modifying in publicly through if statements but radiobutton.checked gave me so many errors. I went back to having the value in the private voids of the radio buttons and i now have one error telling me that pay is not assigned in the current context which makes sense since it is undefined outside of the radiobuttons. Im new to c# so excuse me if this question sounds stupid.
 Here are my radiobuttons, im trying to display variable pay in a messagebox that pops up after clicking a button:
  private void radioButton1_CheckedChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { string pay; if (radioButton1.Checked) pay = "card."; } private void radioButton2_CheckedChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { string pay; if (!radioButton2.Checked) pay = "bank."; } private void radioButton3_CheckedChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { string pay; if (radioButton3.Checked) pay = "Paypal."; }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: rheos is a small lightweight library with helpers to build asynchronous pipelines. It takes inspiration from lo, but allows to do things concurrently. 
 We had a common pattern in our codebase, where we are querying data from database or fetching data from APIs and pushing results into channel for further processing (e.g. pipeline pattern). Instead of repeating the same things over and over and fixing the same mistakes (like forgetting to close a channel or check the context), we decided to create a small library. With the help of generics it is now a breeze to build steam processing pipelines. 
 Use cases: 
  
API requests: do N parallel requests and push the data for further processing
 DB queries: fetch data from database in one goroutine and process results in another.
 Processing messages in batches (e.g. from RabbitMQ)
  
Key Features:
  
Concurrency.
 Cancellation upon context cancellation or error.
 Small composable API.

 NodeJs is a strong opinion for me, given that it's meant for I/O intensive workloads, but Go is also a strong opponent given the lightweight nature of goroutines.
 Any opinion on which one to use out of the 2, and why ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to include libjpeg.h from both MozJPEG and the libJPEGturbo libraries into the same program. 
 Both libraries enact the lib jpeg API which is a standardized set of C functions used to decode and encode JPEG images based on various settings.
 I managed to compile one of the libraries, and then the other, great! 
 I managed to compile both of them together, even better! 
 I went to test the program, and no matter which encoder you picked... The resultant image bytesize was identical.
 Lowering the quality setting worked, but if you switched encoders it would encode to the same image size.
 In other words, one of the libraries was not working. 
 And the other was taking its place. 
 My only logical conclusion was that including two very similarly structured header files in the same program was the culprit?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Solved] I have to calculate a CRC in a CAN network, and i can't understand pseudo-code given by Bosch specifications.
 Here it is:
 CRC_RG = 0;
 REPEAT
 CRCNXT = NXTBIT EXOR CRC_RG(14);
 CRC_RG(14:1) = CRC_RG(13:0);
 CRC_RG(0) = 0;
 IF CRCNXT THEN
 CRC_RG(14:0) = CRC_RG(14:0) EXOR (4599hex);
 ENDIF
 UNTIL (CRC SEQUENCE starts or there is an ERROR condition)
 So i did something like this:
 #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <stdint.h> int main(void) { uint16_t CRCNXT, CRC_RG = 0; uint16_t *ptr = &CRC_RG; int data[16] = {1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1}; int crc_rg (uint16_t *); for(int i = 0; i < 16; i++) { CRCNXT = data[i] ^ crc_rg(ptr); CRC_RG <<= 1; if(CRCNXT) { CRC_RG = CRC_RG ^ 0x4599; } } printf("CRC = %#X\n", CRC_RG); return 0; } int crc_rg (uint16_t *ptr) { int value; value = *ptr & 0x4000; if(value > 0) return 1; else return 0; } 
 But it doesn't quite do the work. Could you give me some hints?
 Edit:
 Solved, thanks to u/cHaR_shinigami solution in comments

 Anyways, I wrote a hash table with my own hash function with fairly less collisions. However, I have no ideas on what table size to choose and whether it should be handled by the user of the hash table or by the library author (me). Currently, I just have a TABLE_SIZE preprocessor definition which is just a numerical value which creates however many records you provide it.
 What would be good for the user? I want to abstract these basic algorithms so that I don't have to deal with C++ for now -- nor do I have to repeat myself everytime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With all of the doom and gloom posts about how bad the market is, I wanted to create a post with a positive experience. 
 I was fired from my last dev job on April 5th for sharing information that I wasn't allowed to supposedly. I sent my offer letter to a school friend who I recommended through an internship program when we were discussing wages, and that friend ended up getting a job offer as well. He was upset that his offer was lower than what I was given, so he sent the recruiter a message about it showing the offer I sent him. I was fired a week later for sharing the info and breaking some policy and what not. 
 I ended up getting a job at a warehouse for a furniture store in the meantime because I didn't qualify for unemployment. While working there, I spent the next two months sending out applications everyday like everyone else does. In those two months, I had 15 companies respond back to me wanting a phone screening, hackerrank test, or a straight up interview: responses that got my foot in the door. I had some rough interviews at first but continued to learn from each one of them until I recieved a job offer on June 4th. 
 For anyone with a similar background, I graduated college with a BS in CS at the end of 2022, and I only have a year and a half experience outside of college. I also have 3 software dev internships throughout college. Though, I've never coded outside of school/work so I don't have a portfolio or personal projects to show. 
 Even though it only lasted two months, I still went through the normal worries and anxiety that most of you have felt or are currently going through. Just remember to keep your head up and to not let yourself feel defeated. Your hard work will come to fruition. There's a light at the end of the tunnel. Whatever cheesey, cliche phrase you need to tell yourself, do it and keep moving forward!

Copy-paste the hex data for a rom into the code definition and add optional inputs to advance the execution one frame at a time. The code's probably a bit messy, and I could probably refactor some of the helper functions, but being able to kinda play turn-based pong at a fraction of an fps in a Turing-incomplete language with no side effects is incredibly neat to me. More usefully, this could be the heart of an emulator extracted to OCaml or Haskell, writing a simple wrapper to interface the output with real display, inputs, and sound.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a brainscratcher: you have a monorepo for your microservices that you run in a k8s cluster. Merging a PR into main releases to staging, and creating a new Github release will promote the latest staging image to production, all automated Github Actions. Works great. But now you want to add one or several hotfix commits to production, but not release the in progress features already out on staging. What's the best way to do that?
  
Have two long lived branches, e.g. develop and main. If you merge a hotfix/ branch to main, it now builds and releases a second image: prod+hotfix. Automation can merge the hotfix commit back to develop (?) so it's also out on staging. But this way you have to build artifacts, ugh.
 Stay with one long lived branch, check out the latest released tag (representing the current state of prod), add your hotfix and build a new image off that branch for production, and merging to main will also add the hotfix commit to staging. Again two artifacts, and the prod image will be built off a short lived hotfix branch?
  
How do smart people handle this? Keeping a linear git history is nice, but you also don't want to have unstable features on production. Can you eat the cake and have it too?

 I'm thinking about installing a Debian or debian-based OS on an old 32 bit laptop I have. I installed Debian and debian-based LMDE 6 in a VM with the specifications of the laptop to get an estimate of the performance. I found both to be similar (probably obvious, cause they're both Debian under the hood), but I wanted to get opinions and suggestions about which one is better in the long run (how stable it is, support for it, etc).
 Thanks
 laptop specs if you need them: 
 Intel Pentium T2060 (2 cores, 1.60GHz), 1GB RAM (which I will be upgrading to 2GB), 120GB HDD (which I will be upgrading to a 256GB SSD). The default OS, Windows 7, ran decently fast with aero off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm a Dec 2021 grad who was fortunate enough to get 2 offers within weeks of each other. It feels kinda ironic because I couldn't get anything for so long after graduating, but I just stuck to improving myself as an engineer and as a candidate, and I guess it paid off.
 The problem is I already started the job I got first - I really like the team (friendly and strong culture of respecting wlb) and the pay is very decent (~100k), but the stack is fairly niche (think like Laravel/RoR). It's also not a brand name company.
 On the other hand, the second offer is with a well known tech company with a good reputation for wlb, and ~150k TC. The team also seems more high-achieving (a lot of US masters and past top tech experience vs career switchers, not that that actually determines the quality of engineer) so maybe I would be able to learn more and make my resume look better.
 Just based on the math, 50%+ increase in pay seems like a no-brainer, but I feel like I would really be letting my team down by leaving so soon after joining, and because I spent so long unemployed, I guess I kinda built some imposter syndrome where I feel afraid I wouldn't be able to deliver if I switch to the second company. But I also don't want my sense of loyalty to a company result in me missing out on a big opportunity, since if it helped their bottom line, I know the company wouldn't hesitate to cut me.
 I would really appreciate hearing everyone's thoughts and advice. Especially on how I should break the news to my current team

 On to my questions.
 Can he really claim to have made safe C++ by suggesting an entirely new implementation of the language? New tool chain that either uses his new compiler or as he puts it, saws the current compiler in half. Different references that replace one of the most useful aspects of the language.

The game itself did not cost me anything but my time. And game development is my hobby. So everything is fine and i dont want to get rich. Seeing others like my game is good enough.
 So, i did not do much marketing activities and got like 50 wishlists in the ~4 weeks between publishing the steam page and releasing the game. So i got a few sales and was very happy. I also got very early 2 positive reviews and the first one was really good and made me proud. It was some youtuber dude wo made a very positive video about it. and i never heard of him before, it was really random and i dont know how he found our about my game. Did i tell you, i was proud and happy? :) i was sure, the 92 Euros would not be a problem and i already had 12 sales :D
 Yeah, no problem. Everything is nice...
 Until the refunding start and 50% of the sales got refunded until now. and every sale maybe is still refundable because of the 14 days refund policy.
 Some refunding players gave reasons like..
 - "low framerate": i tested my game on an old potato low budget laptop and it worked absolutely smooth on that thing that was 5 years ago the cheapest windows laptop on the market, no joke! Even my mothers low budget smarphone runs it at an acceptable speed.
 - "game does not match screenshots and trailer": i dont get that. the trailer shows in every second 100% recorded gameplay and also the screenshots are real screenshots.
 Thats a little bit frustrating. Do you other game devs have made similar experiences?
 i know my game makes more fun when played with/against humans, but thats an hen and egg problem..
 If you want to have a look, my game is called "Pyradice". https://store.steampowered.com/app/2957200/Pyradice/

 I’m on a team of about 9 devs. 3 seniors, 3 mids, 2 juniors, and we work with 3 QA that service the boards of multiple teams. There’s no technical lead but there is a guy whose role is “architect” that comes around our meetings once in a while. He never holds meetings and I can’t really figure out what he does. My hiring was part of doubling the team size and transitioning my manager from de facto lead dev to his current role. 
 The thing is that I just don’t see this as a functional software team. 
 There’s no lead, so for any given project my manager just hands the entire team the what of the work via stories written by product. There’s little to no discussion of the how leading…]]></summary>

 What’s the most efficient way to do that? Is there a book I can read, or any other learning tool you would recommend?
 Should I build a specific project that will expose me to certain things?
 For those that believe they know the language pretty well, what would you advise?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I learned how bitwise operators worked and also about bit fields, and I wanted to make a program that used the concept to get a feel for it. I'm making a super simple program that when ran should generate a random gun based off of the video game borderlands 2.
 When the code is run, it first chooses the gun manufacturer, and then chooses the gun type, but some manufacturers don't produce certian gun types.
  static short generateGunType(short gun) { srand(time(NULL)); reroll: char r = rand()%6; printf("HELLO\n"); switch(r) { case 0://pistol printf("pistol\n"); return PISTOL; break; case 1://assault rifle if((gun & MANUFACTURER_MASK) == MALIWAN || (gun & MANUFACTURER_MASK) == HYPERION) { goto reroll; } printf("assault rifle\n"); return ASSAULT; break; case 2://shotgun if((gun & MANUFACTURER_MASK) == MALIWAN || (gun & MANUFACTURER_MASK) == DAHL || (gun & MANUFACTURER_MASK) == VLADOF) { goto reroll; } printf("shotgun\n"); return SHOTGUN; break; case 3://sniper if((gun & MANUFACTURER_MASK) == BANDIT || (gun & MANUFACTURER_MASK) == TEDIORE) { goto reroll; } printf("sniper\n"); return SNIPER; break; case 4://SMG if((gun & MANUFACTURER_MASK) == JAKOBS || (gun & MANUFACTURER_MASK) == TEDIORE || (gun & MANUFACTURER_MASK) == VLADOF) { goto reroll; } printf("smg\n"); return SMG; break; case 5: if((gun & MANUFACTURER_MASK) == JAKOBS || (gun & MANUFACTURER_MASK) == DAHL || (gun & MANUFACTURER_MASK) == HYPERION) { goto reroll; } printf("rocket launcher\n"); return ROCKET; break; default: return INVALID; } } 
 Is this a fine use of the goto statement, or would it be better practice to use some sort of loop to achieve the same effect? A video I watched said it's generally better to avoid using goto statements, so I'm curious to know what issues this could cause

 I have the following (simplified) version of my issue:
 class Base { public: void method() const {} }; class Derived : protected Base { public: const Base & to_base() const { return *this; } operator const Base &() const { return *this; } }; 
 a)
 Derived foo; const Base & bar = foo; bar.method(); 
 b)
 Derived foo; const Base & bar = static_cast< const Base & >( foo ); bar.method(); 
 The case above is wrong, please discard it.
 What I meant as b) is the following
 Derived foo; const Base & bar = ( const Base & ) foo; bar.method(); 
 c)
 Derived foo; const Base & bar = foo.to_base(); bar.method(); 
 In case a), the compiler (msvc, I feel clang & gcc as well) is unhappy flagging it as an error:
 a conversion exists but it is inaccessible ('cause of protected derivation) .
 In case b) and c), it compiles fine but I ask, shouldn't it issue the same problem? The base class should be inaccessible again? In case a) I provided an implicit method for conversion from type Derived to type Base.
 Thanks
 Edit: fixed case b)

I live in the United States and see my therapist virtually through a service called Thriveworks. 3 months is a long time and I am going to be visiting family while I am there, and it's likely to be a very stressful trip as a result. My therapist told me he could, in the worst case scenario, lose his license if he were to do a session with me while I was abroad. However, he suggested that I use a VPN and said he'd still meet with me for virtual sessions like normal, which is once a week. 
 Is there anything to worry about realistically, from an information security standpoint? Is this a bad idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, please help me find a path.
 I started my career in IT in August 2023 as a frontend developer. In January, I switched to a CCTV company as a software developer, hoping to learn about backend technologies, computer networking, and software development. Initially, I built 2 or 3 components for their software, but for the past five months, I’ve been assigned tasks unrelated to coding, such as remotely fixing camera issues and manually testing software developed by a senior developer.
 Despite expressing my desire to focus on software development, my manager keeps postponing any coding tasks due to ongoing issues with the company’s software. This has hindered my confidence in coding since I only had three months of coding experience from my previous company. Additionally, when interviewers ask about projects I've worked on at my current company, I struggle because I haven't done any significant coding work here. My target is to get a job as a .NET developer.
 I need advice on what to include in my resume regarding my role in this company, which uses WPF .NET framework, while my skills are in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I joined with the hope of gaining backend knowledge and becoming a full-stack developer, but I haven’t received any coding tasks for the past five months. Currently, I am learning ASP.NET Core.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a large project where many classes need to be serialized with json. If I choose one json library to go with, and later want to swap it with another, it will be an enormous task to replace all serialization functions. I was wondering if there is a good approach where swapping between libraries like RapidJSON, nlohmann_json, Boost JSON etc would be least painful?
 I saw this post https://stackoverflow.com/a/31137910/10905379, where they go into mapping class members with tags. This looks like a great solution, because I can completely decouple my code from these libraries! This would in theory also allow me to serialize to other formats like xml without needing to modify classes. But I can't find any more information on this in boost docs or other sources.
 I was wondering if I'm barking at the wrong tree here or if there are more resources available to implement something like this? Would appreciate a nudge in the right direction!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just left my previous company because of boredom and in general to get new experience. My new job is also a lead engineer position (same as before) in a consulting company that also has some SaaS products. The problem is that I see serious red flags and I am thinking about if it's worth to invest my time and energy in it.
  
They seem to have a buzzword driven development. The architecture is a Microservices, event based (Kafka) application. What they process is like 100k events a month. I don't see any justification for this over engineering.
 There are so many services and queues for allmost everything, which would be easily done by just calling a function.
 It's not possible to debug the system for several components, mostly python stuff. They really commit code and deploy it to k8 to debug these components. I have seen 100 commits for one feature just for debugging.
 Most components have no dependency management at all. Not even a simple requirements.txt for python related stuff. 
 The core developers left the company and there was one week for the handover of these critical components.
 The documentation is almost non-existent.
  
I am now there for 1 month and it seems like the part of the system what I should take care off is a bunch services that are at prototype-level experiments put to production. Almost all best practices are missing and it seems like they are constantly pushing for new features, instead fixing the mess. Additionally, the technology is outdated already and should be replaced to stay competitive.
 However, the product idea itself is interesting and I have the experience to transform that into good state (technically). On the other hand it will be hard to shift the culture as they are not a product company. Has anyone a similar experience to get some insights from?

Could distinctly hear a female voice talking to someone. I was confused at first, but sat down at the PC and confirmed it was indeed coming from it. Moved the mouse around, and the conversation faded. I like to think I'm not security illiterate (programmer for 30 years) and run a clean system, and would have otherwise said with an almost 100% certainty that my PC could not be compromised in any way. Also, just to tick off the obvious:
  
No chrome tabs were open that could be playing ads or videos.
 No background apps.
 No games open.
 No open remote desktop sessions.
 No signal/skype/teams or anything of the sort.
 No, I'm not hearing voices in my head, they were 100% coming from the PC. I live in a 4th floor apartment with good ventilation, and do not have any sources of carbon monoxide that I can think of.
  
My speakers are somewhat high end MTMs so I assume they should not be picking up any random interference, but suppose this could not be ruled out entirely?
 None of the malware scans picked up anything.
 What else to check? I'm tempted to wipe the SSD and do a clean install of everything. Though I never installed anything "questionable" to begin with.

I coded in Java for a while (for school stuff) so I understand the basics such as variables, functions, control structures, and I've worked a bit with basic data structures like Arrays, LinkedLists, Stacks, and Queues in Java. I am also fairly familiar with OOP concepts like classes, polymorphism, method overriding and overloading, encapsulation, etc in Java (though not too confident about it just yet). But given that I am still pretty new to C++ and haven't been able to wrap my head around pointers yet (and I need to start learning Cpp as soon as possible because of academic needs).
 I tried learning Java by watching videos and referring to a fat textbook and textual resources online before diving into code as my dad wanted me to have a solid understanding of concepts before starting to write code, but it never really worked out and I could never grasp basic concepts effectively. I actually learnt Java solely by diving into questions from day 1 and looking up the concepts I have didn't understand. Should I do the same for C++? Also to familiarize myself... should I solve problems on Codewars/Leetcode or directly jump into basic projects like TICTACTOE or Hangman games to familiarize myself with the syntax and progressively increase the difficulty of the projects? There are so many different opinions and this is really complicating things for me. What would be your advice to your younger self who just started programming and is confused? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've just begun experimenting around with Rust and I've created a very simple rock-paper-scissors program where the player plays against computer RNG. I was curious which one of these two ways to display the winner is best in your opinion and what are their pros and cons. I chose the first way because i thought it was less repetitive and more readable, though I feel like the second way might be faster, what do you think? (the botch var is the bot's choice while choice is the player's)
 First way:
  if choice == botch { println!("Tie!"); } else if (botch.as_str() == "rock" && choice.as_str() == "paper") || (botch.as_str() == "scissors" && choice.as_str() == "rock") || (botch.as_str() == "paper" && choice.as_str() == "scissors") { println!("Human wins!"); } else { println!("Bot wins!"); } 
 Second way:
  if choice == botch { println!("Tie!"); } else { match botch.as_str() { "rock" => if choice.as_str() == "paper" { println!("Human wins!"); } else { println!("Bot wins!"); }, "scissors" => if choice.as_str() == "rock" { println!("Human wins!"); } else { println!("Bot wins!"); }, "paper" => if choice.as_str() == "scissors" { println!("Human wins!"); } else { println!("Bot wins!"); }, _ => println!("ERROR!"), }; }

 This seems very similar to the Great Recession except that during the Great Recession, international students majoring in econ/math,etc from Ivy Leagues looking into get into Wall Street was disproportionately affected but this time it's the cs majors that are being decimated. I have heard of people graduating from Harvard, etc who couldn't get a job in the States and had to come back to their home country and teach English. 
 Pretty sure that most international CS majors, even those from top schools, won't even be able to secure an internship and even if they do, they won't be able to get a job after graduation and even if they make through it all, only an extremely small minority will be able to get a h1b and then green card and stay in the States. Rest will have to go home. Just like 2008. This time for CS. 
 I think if someone who doesn't have citizenship/green card is really willing to stay in the States, seriously PhD might be the way to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So, I'm communicating with an API that
  
always returns 200 as the status code
 has its own status code that is either "OK" (yeah, a string) or some error message
 indicates not found by returning an empty array
  
I've got over the first two points, but now I'm stuck on the third. I'm serializing the response from the JSON with System.Text.Json and it basically looks like this:
 { "status": "ok", <some other shit> "data": ... } 
 Now, "data" can either be an object ("data": { "ID": "1234" }) when something is found or an empty array ("data": [] ) when not found.
 Basically, I have an ApiResponse<T> generic type where T is the type of the data. This doesn't work when the response is an empty array, so I made a custom JsonConverter for the property. However, those cannot be generic, so I'm at a loss here. I could try switching to XML, but that would require rewriting quite a bit of code probably and might have issues of its own.
 How would you handle this situation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest things I missed from my windows install, I finally found it on Linux. Removing background noise from my mic based on a noise profile, it's so perfect, it works so perfectly! https://github.com/lucianodato/noise-repellent
 It is basically a replacement to reafir substract mode. It can get your noise profile, which should just be background noise, and remove it.
 I find this to be a lot more straightforward to do on Windows, for now, at least based on the way I do it currently. On Linux, Carla can look overwhelming, it was actually easier and faster to me but it does look much worse.
 Anyways, an amazing Linux win here. Only problem? Not a single tutorial tells you about this. Not a single source. I figured this out on my own, I mean google told me about noise repellent (prompt: linux reafir) but I figured out on my own that this confusing tutorial on reaplugs on linux I saw a thousand years ago used carla and I said "maybe Carla helps" without knowing a single thing about it, and I figured it out from there. Easyeffects also helped because their plugin showed up in Carla and I used it as guidance.
 Loving noise repellent. Wonderful work, and I guess it's smarter because it prefers to reduce noise instead of completely remove it (you can still remove it). I don't know if that's smarter.
 IMPORTANT: If you use Carla and maybe Ardour, your noise profile won't be saved. You need to build it yourself and merge pull request #119. Also, if you break easyeffects like I did, just reset the settings. Also, maybe keep a clean profile of carla saved in case you break something
 I hope there is an easier way to implement this, if not now in the future. Currently, I can't find it if I tell google "linux remove background noise", it only tells me of RNNoise and alternatives which work so badly in my case I rather not use it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody!
 I'm using tweak-header approach described here for configuration of my library.
 Here is example how main config file looks like:
 #pragma once namespace config { namespace defaults { using ClockPeriod = std::milli; using ClockRep = std::uint32_t; inline constexpr std::size_t PayloadSize = 8; } using namespace defaults; } #if defined(MYLIB_USER_CONFIG) && __has_include("mylib.tweaks.h") #include "mylib.tweaks.h" #endif 
 Then one can define some mylib.tweaks.h as:
 namespace config { using ClockPeriod = std::chrono::system_clock::period; using ClockRep = std::chrono::system_clock::rep; inline constexpr std::size_t PayloadSize = 64; } 
 This was the idea.
 mylib project structure is following:
 mylib_root - CMakeLists.txt - include - src: CMakeLists.txt with mylib target as static library - samples: CMakeLists.txt with samples target as executable which links with mylib -- config/mylib.tweaks.h - tests: CMakeLists.txt with tests target as executable which links with mylib -- config/mylib.tweaks.h 
 My problem is that I'm not sure about how include path with custom mylib.tweaks.h should be added for mylib target for example.
 One idea was to update include dirs of the mylib target from CMakeLists.txt of sub-directories:
 samples/CMakeLists.txt: # Enable user config for libraries target_compile_definitions(mylib PUBLIC MYLIB_USER_CONFIG) target_include_directories(mylib PUBLIC "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/config") target_link_libraries(samples PRIVATE mylib) add_executable(samples ${SAMPLES_SOURCES}) 
 However, I think it's a bad approach to change library target properties directly like this and from what I saw in my case, it creates conflict when I try to use target_include_directories for mylib from different CMakeLists.txt (different targets like: tests, sample).
 Did anybody have experience with such configuration or maybe have any advice?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was following Build Your Own Text Editor in C, which teaches how to develop a console editor, based off of kilo.
 I've completed the tutorial but was thinking of extending it further with a few preferences, and to also add unit testing, to get a better idea of full-scale projects.
 From all my Google-ing, I've found tools which can be used for writing unit tests, and/or code coverage - such as tst, and gconv. But no references of how to actually unit test a console app, or what all should I focus on.
 I wanted to ask if there's any guidelines or ways someone could recommend. I was thinking something along the lines of just testing I/O, by mocking it for the console, but can't find any reference for the same in C.
 I also referred to dte, which does have a few unit tests, but can't seem to find any for I/O, and also have ended up further confused.
 Any help would be appreciated.

I ended up learning so much of the codebase so quickly and spent hours after I had finished working, reading and learning from these incredible developers and the game's documentation.
 Then the third day came. A meeting with my manager had been added to my calendar. "Nice, another onboarding thing," I thought to myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm currently working at a Fortune 500 company as a Mid/Senior Engineer with around 6 years of experience. I earn approximately $150k total compensation (140k base + 10k bonus) and work 10-20 hours per week.
 Our department's workload is light because we're waiting to migrate a core component to production, which has been delayed several times. The next major project is a massive system rewrite spanning multiple teams and likely taking years, but it's unclear how much work our team will have. Our team lead is still trying to secure work for us.
 My current tasks involve making a few enterprise requests, editing Terraform files occasionally, and debugging issues—mostly grunt work. 
 Even when debugging issues arise, a junior engineer or another engineer often jumps in and takes over, even though I'm supposed to be the go to person for this. This is particularly frustrating because it feels like I'm being sidelined. Perhaps I've asked too many questions or come across as annoying, or maybe he's simply quicker to respond. Recently, he was included in a triage meeting while I wasn't, which has really affected my self-esteem. I might be overthinking it, but it's been bothering me a lot.
 Any interesting projects are quickly taken by our lead engineer and his preferred contractor.
 While I don't consider myself a "rockstar" engineer, I take pride in my problem-solving skills. However, the lack of challenging work is causing my skills to stagnate, and I'm worried about losing my edge.
 I'm feeling uncertain about my career and regret choosing a role at a boring insurance/finance company. Although I'm interviewing elsewhere, it's tough to even get interviews now. My interview success rate has dropped from around 60% to about 5%.
 I'm feeling lost and unsure about how to progress in my career. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Apologies for the long post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven't interviewed for a job in well over 10 years at this point so I am honestly just ramping up into what I'm going to need to prepare for. I fell into this position through being an onsite Data Center Sys Engineer, Virtualization Engineer, technically I'm in the SRE group, but do DevOps deploys and general infrastructure for our different cloud envs. I can script in bash, powershell, python, etc, but nothing that is ever going to impress anyone. I'm less a "move fast and break things" kind of person in favor of stability and making sure my team can sleep at night without outages kind of person.
 I already know if they give me leetcode/hackerrank type questions I'm not going to pass. They gave us hackerrank questions at work to "review" for new hires and half of them were completely irrelevant to our day to day. I have never needed to build a hashmap from scratch since I primarily work in Terraform and Ansible which abstract that work and python has libraries for that. But the company also has a policy of "only hiring developers" for SRE and DevOps roles.
 I've seen people talking about having a repo as a sort of "portfolio." I'm not trying to seed my startup or be a thought leader. I just want to do a good job at work and go home. I love learning new things so I'm not against remediating any skills gaps.
 What are some standard projects I can work on doing mock ups with and but in a repo?
 I prefer to work in Terraform and Ansible but I was thinking:
 -bash scripts for Linux Admin
 -powershell scripts for VMware Admin
 -Python SDK for AWS deploys

 It seems that the const in const auto& is mucking things up? I've played around with this for a good while and I can't seem to figure out why.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce the release v1.0.0. of my library go-ecoflow: https://github.com/tess1o/go-ecoflow/tree/v1.0.0
 This library allows to Get and Set parameters on your Ecoflow devices. The library is implemented via the REST API provided by Ecoflow.
 In this version I've implemented API for all devices mentioned in the Ecoflow documentation:
  
Power Stations (regular ecoflow power stations, like Delta 2, River 2, etc)
 Power Stations (PRO)
 Smart Plug
 PowerStream Micro Inverter
 Smart Home Panel
 Wave Air Conditioner
 Glacier
  
Using the library you can get all parameters available from the device and change device's settings (each device has its own list of settings).
 I've tested it on my two devices: Delta 2 and River 2. 
 I don't expect much more development on this library, since it covers everything available in the official documentation. I might update it when (or if) anything is changed in the documentation.
 My personal use case is https://github.com/tess1o/go-ecoflow-exporter - the Prometheus exporter that fetches the metrics and Grafana Dashboard where I can see all the metrics in one place.
 Thanks.

This seems to constantly come up multiple times a week. "There's so many games on Steam", "I don't have a social following", "I don't have any wishlists", "I don't have a marketing budget".
 Now I'm all for discussing how to improve visibility, wishlist, etc. as these can obviously contribute to a better commercial performance. However, I think everyone is really overreacting and that there is in fact not really a problem to solve. Let me explain.
 There's a huge amount of games launching on Steam every day, but as a quick exercise, go to Steam's upcoming page, narrow it by 1 or 2 tags and check out how many actual objectively well made games have launched in the genr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have been working on my emulator for just over a month now, and it can load and play simple games. Unfortunately, I have been unable to pass Blargg's Timer test in their 02-interrupts (part of cpu_instrs). I have implemented timers using both Pandocs, Cycle Accurate GB docs, and peeking at others' code. When outputting values for TIMA, TAC, DIV, etc. it seems to be clocking exactly as intended (as per my understanding). However, there appears to be a discrepancy with Blargg's test, as follows:
 If we look at the assembly for his test, it does the following for test #4:
  
Sets TAC to $05 - This essentially turns on the timer, and sets the increment ratio to 16 t-cycles
 Sets TIMA to 0 - Start timer from 0
 Sets IF to 0 - Clear interrupt flags
 Delay by 500 t-cycles
 Load A with I…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently the implementation is the following:
 _CONSTEXPR20 ~_Optional_destruct_base() noexcept { if (_Has_value) { _Value.~_Ty(); } } 
 Shouldn't it be something like the following?
 _CONSTEXPR20 ~_Optional_destruct_base() noexcept(noexcept(std::declval<_Ty>().~_Ty())) { if (_Has_value) { _Value.~_Ty(); } } 
 As a sidenote, libc++ doesn't have any noexcept markings, nor does the standard say anything about it. 
 It does specify that std::optional::reset is indeed noexcept , which brings up the question: shouldn't that also use the noexcept propagation, as in my second example?

 enum class SystemStatus : bool { OK = false, WARNING = true, FAILURE = true }; 
 Questions about this: 1. Does it compile just fine? Are there compiler flags that will take issue with it? 2. Does SystemStatus::WARNING == SystemStatus::FAILURE evaluate to true or false?
 I ask these questions because I think I can find practical use cases for such an enum class, as (assuming #2 evaluates to false) you can have a decision tree that behaves differently for warning vs failure, and still have some additional functionality that (using static_cast) treats warning and failure the same, such as with unit testing.
 Would that be an anti pattern? Is it better to just stick with unique error codes?

 To track what specialization is left for implementing I considering using switch with -Wswitch compiler warning message.
 But to be actually consistent and practical at the same time I need someting like
 std::not_specialization_defined<Algo::step_into<Mode::two>>("compile time message to user")
 That way I can choose at what order messages will show up, helping me to focus on what next needs to be implemented, but not ending with compiler error as test needs to be run for currently implemented specializations.
 Anyone see if this can be implemented considering class definition must not be changed just for this use?

 Ive been looking for some good resources to up my understanding of some core C++ language features and best practices. In some older threads, I consistently see people recommending Scott Meyers’ books, in particular the latest effective modern c++. 
 I did most of my systems classes in school in C, and I’ve spent enough time working with C++ to have recognized that the languages are different in substantial ways. In particular, things I have seen and have a cursory understanding of but want to learn more about include smart pointers, move semantics, lambdas, iterators, template metaprogramming, etc. 
  
Is Effective Modern C++ a good starting point to learn some of these topics? I imagine for some of the later features it is, but what about older language features in that list, like templates? 
 
Is the book dated? The latest edition covers C++11/14, and while my hunch is that not too much has changed that would affect best practices, I want to know people’s thoughts. 
 
Any additional/alternative resources that could be helpful that people recommend, or suggestions?
 
 Thanks

I would also solve final school exam assigments, which were quite challenging but fun. I also started to learn unity and c#, but so far it seems that it's more about design than programming? Correct me if I am wrong. 
 I would like to try learning something a bit more advanced, but it seems like every programming tutorial is either very basic or super advanced stuff without any explanation of what particular line of code is for. 
 People say "just do projects", "learn programming by programming" and I don't find that very specific. I can't think of anything aside from video games or websites and those type of mini projects I mentioned. Could you give an example of what I could do at this point? Maybe some intermediete concepts I should look into and perhaps tutorials which explain more advanced stuff with deeper explanation?

 There are mixed opinions on systemd all over the internet, most of which are mentioning the fact that it violates the "do one thing and do it well" philosophy. That just does not seem right in combination with something like Arch.
 EDIT (copied from my reply): So far, from all the replies, I think my opinions were a bit off. systemd is not bloated, mostly due to the way it's split, and still is probably the best choice as an init system (as for both functionality and popularity). Another thing I didn't notice is that many alternatives could be far worse, eg. OpenRC (again not to hate on it, everything has its pros and cons). Thank you everybody.

Every job I've had, I've passed the tests and take home projects and I even had to do a test in front of one company in person which landed me the job.

It just won't work, neither do I have any clue on how to achieve that. No wrappers, libraries helps or docs flying around. I have no idea where to look for any bit of useful information anymore.

 Since the integrated GPU is the weaker one I don't use it.
 I have a Windows application that just will not run on Linux. I tried everything. Lutris, Wine, Proton, Bottles, Heroic Game Launcher. Nothing worked. The application immediately crashed with no error output.
 I then set up a Windows 10 virtual machine in QEMU/KVM and Virt Manager.
 The application didn't crash inside the Windows 10 VM but it gave me an error message that I need a GPU with Pixel Shader to run it.
 I have both IOMMU and SVM enabled in my BIOS and Linux. "/sys/kernel/iommu_groups" comtains numbered folders. If IOMMU was not enabled the "iommu_groups" folder would be empty as far as I have read.
 I've been trying for 3 days to get GPU pass-through working in QEMU/KVM. So far I didn't make any progress at all.
 Passing the integrated GPU to the VM and it wont even boot. Virt Manager is just displaying something with "Bus reset not available"
 Passing the dedicated GPU and I just get a black screen. I can't do anything and have to press the power button of my PC to hard-reboot.
 Why is GPU pass-through such a bottomless hell?!
 I'm seriously considering dual booting Windows because dual boot is a million times easier than GPU pass-through!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to compile the JPEG-XL reference implementation for use in iOS, but their support of Apple products seem spotty at best (e.g. macOS build support is "best effort" while iOS support is non-existent). There is one example of a fully-functional, compiled JXL file for iOS which proves this is doable, but I don't trust that person enough to insert his blob into my app.
 I've tried using cmake and ios-cmake toolchain to no success, but this is likely because I'm new to programming, have never compiled anything, and don't know what I'm doing. JXL having dependencies (highway, libpng, brotli, etc.) complicates things as I assume I'll have to compile those for iOS too.
 Any hints or pointers would be of huge help.

 I think this is called delegating constructors. But after searching stackoverflow, all I can find are people saying:
  
You cannot call another constructor from constructor body. Must use member initializer list
 You should extract the common functionality into a separate function

Now I feel like maybe it would have been simpler to apply for jobs without a masters.
 I want to be a software developer and I love systems programming with either C++ or Rust, but I am afraid that some companies will simply not hire someone with a masters since I will ask for a higher salary... 
 I am Canadian and things are not great here (unemployment peaking, gdp per capita down to 2017 levels) but I am wondering how I can approach looking for a job where I can work on solving hard problems on most days, considering moving to another country for a few years if I must.
 I know that for most companies, programming is a tool to accomplish something else, so it isn't their main focus, but I feel like having spent 3000 hours on my personal projects in C++ I should be able to help no matter what the context is.
 Any tip is appreciated, I am looking for jobs on LinkedIn and Indeed and not having much success.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone considering switching to Linux as my primary operating system, there are a few things giving me pause:
  
Proper HDR and color management support: While I understand advancements are being made in this area, and progress looks promising, the current state of HDR and color management on Linux is lacking compared to other platforms.
 
Lack of custom mouse acceleration programs: I haven't been able to find any reliable mouse acceleration programs that are compatible with anti-cheat software. If anyone is aware of such a program, I'd appreciate the recommendation.
 
OLED care software for laptops: This isn't a dealbreaker, but it would be a nice quality-of-life feature to have software that can dim static elements or shift the screen image to prevent burn-in on OLED laptop displays (in my case a Asus Vivobook).
 
 Despite these concerns, I'm still excited about the prospect of using Linux as my primary operating system, and I hope the community continues to address these issues. If anyone has insights or solutions to the points I've raised, I'd love to hear them.
 Furthermore, I'd love to hear what aspects of Linux are lacking for your usecase.
 Wishing you all a wonderful day!

Not that I’m afraid of challenging concepts. I am going to start this out by saying I am not a programmer, however, I am trying my best to learn on my own. currently, I’m trying to code the hello world program. 
 My goal is to build a game. 
 Code: Hello, World!
 VSCode
 MinGW complier
 Command: 
 include <isostream>
  int main(){ std::cout << “I like pizza!”; return 0; 
 }
 ERROR CODE: (1) cannot open source file “iostream”. Please run the ‘Select IntelliSense Configuration…” command to locate your system headers. 
 (2) namespace “std” has no member “cout”
 I didn’t complete the rest of the code, still stuck on the errors of this part. I would’ve showed my screenshot, but that’s not an option here. In my command prompt I inputted a code to show me where the file is located in my compiler but I’m not seeing what instructors have on their screens. 
 At his point, I’m severely off track of the YouTube course I was following. (BroCode). Please help me understand this complex language.
 NOTE: I’m unsure if my complier is the problem. The code gives me errors, but when I input it into an online CPP compiler - it works fine. 
 And yes, I double checked that my compiler is CPP and not C or C#

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dynamic Programming
 Hello guys, I have this problem that I need to solve related to dynamic programming and I need some help.
 I have a grid of size L x C, where each position is filled with a lamp and each lamp has a brightness level. I need to turn on the lamps in a way that maximizes the brightness, but without turning on adjacent lamps.
 The input first receives 3 integers: the number of rows, the number of columns, and the number of lamps, followed by 7 integers for each lamp, which are: row coordinate, column coordinate, brightness intensity (0 to 100), and 4 booleans indicating if the lamp is adjacent to another by the right, top, left, and bottom.
 The output is basically the number of coordinates, the total brightness and a list of the coordinates of the lamps that are going to be on to generate the maximum brightness.
 Can someone give me some ideas please?!!! 🙏🙏
 Example:
 Input: 3 4 11 1 1 9 1 0 1 1 2 1 5 0 1 0 1 3 1 3 1 1 1 0 1 2 6 1 0 1 0 3 2 9 1 0 1 0 1 3 2 0 0 1 1 2 3 1 1 1 0 1 3 3 4 0 1 1 0 1 4 2 1 1 0 1 2 4 7 0 1 1 0 3 4 1 1 0 0 1
 output: 5 28 1 2 2 1 3 2 2 4 3 4

 An abstraction is process of making sense to something. It is about semantics, but not realization details. We use interfaces to interact with it, but we do not know what's under the hood. In this way, I think we can call any function (and even a standard data type) a result of abstraction: we are given a function, we know what this function do, but don't know HOW it actually do a work we need. We also use interface given by a function or... we call a data type by things we can do with it (because it's actually just a set of bytes)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bit of a debugging story... I was writing a JIT compiler (long story); after a restructuring of the codebase and ironing out the initial bugs, I hit a really peculiar problem. It worked alright under gcc but strangely Clang failed with a segfault. The instruction in question was an access to a pointer 8 bytes before the JITted function before calling it, which was odd, because I was only calling the function and not doing anything else. It was a compare with this constant 0xc105cafe which looked out of place and seemed very much like hexspeak. Looking it up on a search engine lead me straight to a source file in clang's source code. Turns out that if UBSan is enabled, then Clang (undocumentedly) requires that the two words before the entry of every function be accessible. They claim that a function where the previous two bytes are not accessible is "not reasonable for application or library code", and the maintainers don't want to fix it for (annoyingly legitimate AFAICT) performance reasons. (Sorry for my horrendous English, by the way)
 TL;DR: When using UBSan, Clang uses a workaround that requires the two words before all functions being accessible, a function where is considered "unreasonable". My JIT (like most others I would think) uses mmap to get pages for writing bytecode to (so they can be made executable later) and when compiled under UBSan/Clang, calling the JITted function segfaults because of said hack.

Hoping to get rid of windows for good as most of my terminal scripts are cross platform already and I have a 4090 PyTorch setup that I can play modded Skyrim/Fallout on proton whenever I get the itch.
 There is only one piece of software keeping me from ditching Windows 100%. 
 FL Studio. 
 As of right now, Linux Pro Audio is better than Windows because Jack/Pipewire is far better Pro Audio Driver than ASIO/CoreAudio have ever been. 
 Wondering if any guru has gotten it working with real time latency. Wine causes XRUNS when running the WineAsio driver and buffer sizes and latency must increase to accommodate. The Wine NSPA Kernel that is meant to fix real time audio gives me better performance but xruns pop up at ~15ms or under. 
 If not, can any recommend a KVM solution that would let me run it on Mac/Windows VM that can route with Jack/Pipewire? Would obv pass through audio card. But if there is a config out there that would allow me to run the FL without needing to restart every time, I’d love to hear it. I would even buy another audio interface just for routing from the pass through audio via cable to my Linux audio card. 
 I know the answer is likely no but I can’t be the only moron that has been trying to make this work for years. I am a Linux power user but far from an expert. Any thoughts, leads, or advice would be helpful.

 I have had multiple message me asking for an update so here is one.
 It has been over a year and i still work there, not long after i posted that. I went and explained a lot of my frustrations to our CEO, he promised to look into it and get my answers. Within an hour the CTO sat me down with our CEO, and he told me straight to my face he did not see me as someone who would be capable as a tech lead, nor someone capable of running a team. In his mindset as i am too "rigid" and not willing to take "risks".
 I was really taken back, but just accepted it as i realized that yeah with my salary and having less on my plate was fine. I then burned all my vacation time and asked our CEO if he would be willing to let me have a month off paid. He let me. 
 So i went away and spent almost 3 months fully expecting to be let go when i came back. I removed slack from my phone, and went with my SO on an extended vacation, spent a bunch of time polishing resume and working on leet code for a month. It was amazing. 
 I came back and i was not let go. I even switched teams internally to our AI team, to pump up my resume in case i am let go. Last month i got another 10% pay raise for my "excellent" work from my manager, and our CTO inquired about if i would be willing to step up to become a staff engineer with no real pay raise. I said no. 
 I work maybe 20 hours a week now including meetings completely remotely, do my tasks for our sprint, then clock off. It has been the happiest i ever have been. I am paid more than any other engineer by far, however i am in constant fear i losing my job. So i am just banking all my extra money for an early retirement i guess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm trying to work through this book (the 3rd edition), and I keep having issues with the included header file/module. Here is a link to the header files: https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html
 Trying to do some of the Vector questions in the book, I have this code:
 #include "PPP.h" int main() { vector<string> censor_list = { "Broccoli", "Carrot" }; cout << "Please enter some words: " << '\n'; vector<string> words; for (string word; cin >> word;) { words.push_back(word); } ranges::sort(words); for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) { if (words[i] != censor_list[0] && words[i] != censor_list[1]) { cout << words[i] << '\n'; } else { cout << "BLEEP!\n"; } } } 
 The code might not be the most efficient or anything, but I'm just using what's shown in the book so far without actively looking for outside information. When I run this I get:
 https://i.imgur.com/AKLlBin.png
 Does anyone have any idea what's causing the repeated outputs there? And if there's anything I can do to fix or stop it. I've had an issue with the header files this book provides in the past that I had to get help with here on this subreddit. It required going into the header files and fixed 2 lines. So I'm not sure if this is something I'm doing wrong or something wrong once again with the provided files.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I just wanted to make a post to see if anyone could relate to me, and if so, has any advice or just share their experience. Just graduated from a top 10 CS school, >3.5 GPA, two internships (one Fortune 500), U.S. Citizen, and hiring freeze led to no return offer. 200 total applications, all rejections. It really crushed me to make it to a round 6 and then get rejected, thats just brutal. Been desperately scrambling. 
 This week, I got a 80k IT indian consulting firm job. I know this market is tough, and this is a solid starting salary with everything that's going on. 
 Unfortunately, I can't help but feel angry at myself when I see my peers at Google and equivalents, making 6 figures. Some of these people used to make fun of me for struggling so hard in Computer Science. Still I persevered. I think back to my sleepless nights all the way back to high school, dozens of AP classes, all hoping for it to work out in the end, and just feel regret. I wish I didn't stress myself into depression to end up with this result.
 I don't want to see ungrateful, but I am struggling with these feelings and feeling lonely in it. At least amongst my own network, I don't know anyone who landed in the spot that I did who did not have below a 3.0 GPA and no internships. I just wanted to reach out and see if there's any other academically oriented CS grads who are in the same boat. I feel like I had an amazing opportunity at this school that I totally fumbled. Maybe I didn't spend enough time on leetcode. Maybe I could have attended more career events. Pushed a little harder in classes I got a B in. I guess it doesn't matter now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m doing some experimentations and wanted to provide a custom main function. The idea is the shared library defines int main() and calls a function called “onStart()” that is declared but not defined. That’s up to the linking executable to define.
 Oddly when I compile the shared library I get an undefined symbol error surrounding the onStart function during its “linking” stage which is super confusing given its compiling a library what is it doing linking anything? I’ve checked and it’s definitely only building the shared library there shouldn’t be a linking stage? 
 Like I’ve built shared libraries with dependencies in the past and I never had to link against those dependencies until the executable linking stage for obvious reasons- any ideas guys? Is some of my knowledge fundamentally wrong?

 I’m in the process of learning C# and would like some help with a project I have in mind. I want to create a program that checks data to ensure it follows certain rules. This involves cleaning, processing, and merging data from various Excel workbooks, as well as performing calculations. Once the checks are complete, the program should output an Excel file containing all the data that failed the checks (e.g., one tab with all objects missing key components).
 For example, I want to check if a particular object has all the required parts, such as ensuring a computer always has a GPU, CPU, etc.
 Previously, I have automated this type of work using Python and Pandas, and it was quite straightforward. I am looking for the easiest and most efficient way to handle similar data processing tasks in C#. Here are a few options I am considering:
  
Loading the Excel files with EPPlus, then converting to CSV and using Microsoft DataFrame as it appears to resemble Python DataFrames.
 Using EPPlus for the entire process.
 Reading the files into an SQL database and then working with the data. This might require clearing the database each time the program runs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Idk if it is a right sub, but maybe...
 SO, I am in need of cross-compiling a Qt project to aarch64 custom linux made with buildroot, and the problem a have that a target system uses glibc 2.34 library and compiled program cant run because of that.
 What have I tried:
  
Compiling a project with aarch64-linux-gnu cross-compiler with static linking of libraries (basically "-static" flag) (with luck, it works, but only for simplier projects, Qt project uses makefile that needs to be configured)
 For my qt project I tried getting binaries from target system and put it in LIBS section in makefile, for compiler and linker I used cross one (no luck, it compiles, but error with glibc version used in target system, static linking didnt worked there, I only managed to statically link glibstdc++ but not glibc)
  
What solutions came into my mind:
  
Compile with target libc.so (no luck, I think it heavely depends on lots of libraries that I dont know)
 Static link of those libs (it worked with simplier project, but maybe I dont know how to properly make it with makefile)
 Use linux distro that works on glibc 2.34 and has all needed packages, like cross-compiler (that also uses glibc 2.34, qt 5.15.2, etc. (currently thinking about this solution)
  
The problem is that the target system has no any toolchains for building projects neither a package manager, and building new buildroot system is not an option.
 Right now I doing all the work on ubuntu 22.04 with newer version of glibc working from virtual box on windows.
 So, whats your opinion about this, what should I do to make everything work.
 P.S I'm not really a linux user, so i can't know much about some essential things

 I was talking with a friend today about c++. He explained to me that if c++ took time to evolve was because Linux was blocking it's evolution in order to avoid breaking changes in the ABI.
 I took some time to do some research about it but it was unfortunately a dead end.
 So is it true ?
 Thank you very much in advance for any help

 I've seen the hundreds of posts on various subreddits talking about how saturated the computer science industry is and that is nearly impossible to obtain your first job. Many posts talk about how there is hundreds of applications for each job listing.
 Now, at Starbucks (least here in Canada), it's the same. When a store posts an opening, we average about 250-300 applications in 48 hours. The managers have been known to "lotto pick" applications since there is no real requirements to work at Starbucks. …]]></summary>

 I'm really sorry to bother any of you.
 I'm relatively new to C++ and I encounter a bug I can't seem to fix.
 The "loadLevel" function gets me a crazy amount of compiler errors like :
 src/include/Functions.hpp:19:44: error: 'level' was not declared in this scope 19 | void loadLevel(std::vector<std::unique_ptr<level>>& levelsVector, std::vector<std::string>& musicAdressVec, int levelToLoad, int slot, Settings& settings, int& money, bool& inMenu, bool& inSettings, std::vector<SaveSlot>& slots); src/include/Functions.hpp:19:44: error: template argument 1 is invalid src/include/Functions.hpp:19:44: error: template argument 2 is invalid src/include/Functions.hpp:19:49: error: template argument 1 is invalid 
 Here's the code :
 #ifndef FUNCTIONS_HPP #define FUNCTIONS_HPP #include <SFML/Audio.hpp> #include <SFML/Graphics.hpp> #include <string> #include <cmath> #include <level.hpp> #include <memory> struct Settings { //settings content (actually defined in my code) }; Settings loadSettings(); // works void saveSettings(const Settings& settings);SaveSlot loadGame(int slot); // works void loadLevel(std::vector<std::unique_ptr<level>>& levelsVector, std::vector<std::string>& musicAddressVec, int levelToLoad, int slot, Settings& settings, int& money, bool& inMenu, bool& inSettings, std::vector<SaveSlot>& slots); // doesnt work #endif // FUNCTIONS_HPP 
 Does anyone know what might be the issue?
 Thank you for the time you took reading my post,
 Loïc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During my second semester in college, I completely disregarded academics, and my college situation is now very bad. I barely passed a few of my classes, and for some, I have nothing done.
 Instead of studying, I focused entirely on coding. I would stay up nights coding, wake up at 3 pm, having slept through all my lectures, and then go back to coding. This was my routine throughout the second semester. I find coding very fun, and I posted everything I wrote on my GitHub, which ended up being really helpful in finding a job. My plan was not to land a job like this, I just enjoyed doing it, and at a certain point I had a feeling. I don't go to college, I don't have a job, I'm achieving nothing doing this, so I decided to go after a job. I saw that many places had a minum of a bachelors degree and the other jobs were just some internships, which I applied for. After some time, I got an offer to go for a "try-out" at a very big company, of course I accepted.
 In the interview, the HR manager didn't ask me any coding questions; we just talked about what my job would be like and even commented on my GitHub projects. I got through the "testing" phase, which lasted a few months but felt really quick. After that, I received a raise and a long-term spot on the team. Despite this, I don't feel very accomplished or excited because of my college situation.
 I'm attending college to land a job in software engineering, but I managed to do that early in my college journey. Now, I will probably have to retake the second semester or just move forward with the academic debt. I want to be happy, but failing college is a big hit for me, especially since my dad didn't finish college and wants me to at least finish it. That puts a lot of pressure on me.
 I think the best move here is to hold on to this job as long as I can to gain job experience for when I need to find a new job in the future.

 Its for a game server, this is upon a players login. Is this merely a case of a longer initial load for quicker prolonged loads vs quick initial load for slightly longer prolonged experience, IE eager vs lazy?

 Today I timeshifted into snapshot with different kernel version and couldn't boot. Long story short, chatgpt made me break it even more. 
 One very grumpy day later and lot of support from my gf, I chrooted for the first time and remade initcpio and grub config. 
 It worked! I'm so proud of myself.
 How do I dodge this mistake in the future? I read about various strategies along the lines of downgrading kernel before snapshotting back, but that can be easily forgotten further down the line I think. Any advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I’m a Beginner in C and Programming in general and only did a handful of projects. My last one was a calculator where you could input every series of operations and numbers and it would give you the solution. It was very interesting and gave me a good overview of basic c/programming, but what now? 
 I want to elevate my skills to a new level and don’t really now what I can do. I thought about doing GUI’s in C and Graphics in General but I don’t want to rely on to many Library’s. 
 Do you have any suggestions for cool Projects that would be in my reach?
 Thanks in Regards :)

 I started to dislike my job, saved up some money, left the AI industry, and now I'm working on my own game despite having no connections in the games industry. I recently started talking about it here on reddit, and I noticed that other developers are super nice and helpful. And just now, a fellow developer made a commercial for my game, just because she wants to support it (and probably because she realized how bad I am at editing videos). My mind is blown.
 Did you have a similar experience when you got into game development? Was I just lucky?
 By the way, you should definitely follow the developer I mentioned above. She is awesome.

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86_pQCKOIPk&list=PLPaoO-vpZnumdcb4tZc4x5Q-v7CkrQ6M-&index=9unfortunenly
 unfortunely, he makes them on C++, in which i dont blame him since C is very bare bones, and i tried converting some of the code from the tutorials, i did succesfully do that, but i cant with the camera, he use classes for it, but since C doesnt have classes, i used structures instead, and now stuck here about a function i made that assigns camera position, orientation, up position, width, height, and i made a struct parameter, anyone who uses the function needs to create a struct. then pass that struct to the function and the function does the following:
 void camera_new(struct Camera *camera, vec3 position, int width, int height) { glm_vec3_copy(position, camera->position); glm_vec3_copy((vec3){0.0f, 0.0f, -1.0f}, camera->orient); glm_vec3_copy((vec3){0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f}, camera->up); camera->width = width; camera->height = height; } 
 btw i used a fork i think of GLM or opengl mathmatics called "cglm" and the function glm_vec3_copy basically copies vector 1 to vector 2, as you can see here, and under it is where the actual problem that doesnt make sense to me, my window crashes, and when i make all of the function body or logic to a comment basically like removing its logic, it works fine.
 edit: i also tested glm_vec3_copy to see if it works, it also doesnt, which tells me that the problem is how im accessing the structure, did i do something wrong here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux newbie here so please be nice
 I'm heavily considering moving from Windows as I've had nothing but problems and in general I do not like the direction Microsoft is heading. I was looking for a much more lightweight and more private alternative to Windows and Debian Linux came up a lot. After reading up on it and seeing how everyone says its on of the most stable distros out there I thought this might be perfect for my usecase.
 My usecase:
 I'm a digital artist, I use graphics tablet via HDMI and USB ports and I dabble in game-dev with Godot game engine. I don't play any games I have a Xbox for that, but I do like to watch Stuff on YouTube a lot as well as Netflix/Disney+. I use a laptop but its a desktop replacement machine so I don't care about Battery life. It has a 1060 6GB GPU. Currently looking for good alternative programs to Krita.
 So my questions are:
  
If you use private browsing in a browser like Chrome or Firefox, is it really private? Like is it possible for any contents to spill over to disk or get cached to disk and is there a easy way to prevent that?
 Will I need a anti-virus for Linux and if so which one is the best one to get that is low impact on my system?
 Can everything or most thing be accomplished by using the GUI/desktop
 Can I have multiple drives on Linux, like on my windows system I have a C drive and then another SSD which is my D drive.
 Is Debian stable? Like are there any forced updates or crashes that can happen?
 Is there a way to delete all traces of USB drive history? 
 Is there any keylogging or stuff like that on Debian?
  
That's all the things I can think of at the moment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on my first commercial release. I cant quit my job like so many posts seem to do (How do you quit for months and have no money/ Where do you get money to pay for things like your game being on steam, or copyright, or commissions for music and art?), I work full time, and use that money to completely fund my game myself. 
 I basically have no money to do anything besides commission art or music that is desperately needed, or pay for the fees of getting your game on a storefront. 
 Nearly every week I get a message, or email from some service or person who can "Help my game reach the audience it needs to be successful" or a publisher that wants ME to pay for their publishing services (Doesn't a good publisher invest in a game they believe in?) 
 These are all scams that would cost literally thousands of dollars. Spending that would be my entire budget for my game for a year, and I have no guarantee they are not just having 2000 bot accounts follow my game or wishlist it, with no actual action of them buying it, and no organic word of mouth spread of my game. I have even had offers from "Legit" companies but their marketing package is close to $5,000 (Designed for indie solo devs, what a joke) 
 These scammers and scam companies profit off of the hopes and dreams of someone working years of their life to try to make a fun game. All I want is to make a few people smile with my game, and its shameful that there appears to be a whole industry designed to scam a person like myself. 
 If there is any lesson with this, Make sure to google and reddit search every company or person that gives you an offer, or says they can help your game reach the right audience. Almost every offer I have received I found a post on reddit from a year or two ago that is a game dev asking about if that offer is a scam or not. Thank you for all of those who have asked these questions in the past!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently joined a small team project to finish up a project. I am getting my job tasks sorted out and my new lead just confirmed with me that for each pixel art character (with 4-8 directions of animations for walking, attack, etc.) I’d receive $15. Is that too low? Not bad? 
 Important to note she is paying out of pocket to employ her team so I understand it won’t be a lot. I’m more wondering if it’d be fair to ask for maybe 18 or 20 per character if it includes all needed sprite sheets.

 Since I already have my BS in CS I’m looking into transitioning into the cloud. Do I need to be good at Leetcode or would Leetcode easy’s be enough for an interview?
 Edit: Changed “Illness” to fibromyalgia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is for home desktop usage, not servers/data centers where XFS is far more common.
 performance - in every test I could find, XFS is near the top, beating btrfs/ext4. Its esp good for parallel workloads and almost everything on a modern desktop is like that. The only perf concern I read about is it used to have higher cpu usage for updating metadata but I believe thats been fixed and no longer relevant?
 (I think for most users, performance in benchmarks may not be noticeable and other features matter more, but its still an important consideration)
 SSD/OS installs - XFS is almost as fast as f2fs for these. I see no reason why anyone would use f2fs on anything other than a sd card or on any NAND device with wear leveling.
 CoW/snapshots - this is no doubt a very powerful feature of zfs…]]></summary>

 I belive I am proficient enough with c++, but our school only let's us use the 98 standard, so I am not familiar with newer things. 
 I'd be more than happy to work with just 98 for my assignment, but is there anything that pops into your mind when you think "98vs17" that I might want to read about before jumping into it? 
 Cheers!
 Edit: I should clarify, this is a home assignment for an interview, not school work

 It follows an application flow from a user to a GKE-hosted app, covering common components like GCLB, Ingress, and Network Policies. I start with the basics and also show how to use the Client Intents CRD (from the Otterize OSS project) for easier Network Policy management.
 Would love to hear your feedback and any questions you have!

 I figure this is most likely a scam, but I'll ask here for confirmation and so other people don't need to ask.
 I received this dm in discord: 
  
Greeting! I am an assistant of the Steam online games store - https://gamesforfarm.com/
 I’ll be brief - our store is aimed at selling indie games, in this category we occupy one of the leading places in sales, we > have been working for over 3 years, we have a large number of reviews, as well as a large active community (over 7000 subscribers on Discord, as well as more than 10,000 subscribers on other social networks)
 I am writing to you because we are interested in purchasing keys to your games in bulk. If you are also interested - let me know, we will discuss all the details and will definitely come to a mutually beneficial offer 🙂
  
This comes after I published the store page for my game (I only have one, so the fact that they say "games" means this is probably an automated bot), which will be released next week. The wishlisht rate has been pretty poor, so I doubt they have found the demo so interesting that they want to buy copies in bulk lol.
 So yeah, this is totally a scam, but I'm curious as to how it's supposed to work. I give them the keys and somehow I never get the money?

 The culture seems terrible. The people I met so far seem great but... the glassdoor reviews are like a 2.2
 They want in-office 5 days a week, no exceptions. The work is mostly refactoring legacy code, which sounds terrible.
 But I have to take it since I got laid off in January and this is finally the first offer I got
 How much of an asshole would I be if I kept interviewing? What if I got an offer in 2 weeks, can I like... quit on them and take that? How bad is that?
 EDIT: should add a little more detail. if it was a big corporation, i wouldn't gaf. so many companies i interviewed with treated me like a piece of shit
 but the reason why i feel shitty is because out of all the 20 companies i've interviewed at so far, the team at this place goes out of their way to email me being like "hey, let me know if you need anything or have any questions" the recruiter emails me to check in every 2 days. even a person from another team who interviewed me not even on this team reached out to ask if i had any further questions and i coudl email him
 never had a company treat me like this. so it feels kinda asshole-ish to just bail on them
 "so why dont you want to work here" is probably the question. the people on the TEAM are very nice... but the VP and SVP of eng were assholes during the interview (kind of disrespectful tbh)

I'm attempting to migrate a WPF app of mine to Blazor in an effort to learn some new skills. I'm running into an issue getting a core component of my app working in Blazor and was hoping some one a bit more experienced could help point me to the right path.
 In my app I have a virtualized grid of images. The image controls have a set width, with a clamped height. The image itself is then placed in that control and scales (aspect correct) to fill the control. The mage control grows to allow the image to take as much space as possible, clamping the height if the scale gets too big. The height of any given row is the height of the tallest item IN that row.

 The context is I want to dualboot my work laptop in Windows and Debian, and so far I got the bitlocker encryption working for the Windows Partition, working seamless. Company policy enforced drive encryption, especially when data's on it.
 But Debian is the difficult part. I don't want to enter the password every time I boot up... 
 Is there a way to let TPM take care of that with Debian? If so please explain or link me some resources! I would appreciate the help.

 We're currently working our first game, "The Nightscarred: Forgotten Gods", and today we hit 4k wishlists in first week of our Steam page.

 It is an immersive first-person action game, which has very niche and undersaturated market in my opinion, so wherever we share the game, it definitely gets attention of the people. We're also implementing co-op support into it, so that's another unique selling point from our side.

What was the change, and how did it enhance productivity, morale, and workflow? What were the key challenges and how were they addressed? Any effective strategies or practices?
 I'll add one from my side. We had a communication platform which part of the communications business logic was handled by an external company. The big problem with that is diagnostic and turn around on issues, or potential service down time due to bad ci/cd practices on their end. 
 After discussions with the company, we managed to acquire this quite core service to our product, and while we inherited the responsibility to evolve and maintain the service internally now, a lot of dev blocking frustrations and ooh call situations went away. Overall a net positive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently finished watching a great video from NDC on new .NET8 features and while the content and presentation was fantastic, the incessant code vomit from Copilot every time a character was typed was a huge distraction. At several points throughout the talk the presenters pause to consider whether or not what copilot suggested was intellible, or laugh at how wrong it was. Or worse still, recognise that while the suggested code seemed correct, it wasn't quite right due to a nuance. 
 I have nothing against Copilot as a product and think it can serve as a valuable assistant for certain tasks, but please keep it out of all live coding / tutorial type content. As a seasoned .NET developer I can happily "see through" the prompts and focus on the actual intent of the presenters but I can imagine how jarring and disorienting it would be to newer developers trying to understand the concepts and follow code while the layout jumps all over the screen in unpredictable ways.
 I'm not sure if this is something that Microsoft is mandating that all of their presenters enable but it's really detracting from their otherwise fantastic content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I applied for a role within Europe and was sent a link to an OA. There was an option for a practice test to get familiar with the test environment.
 The practice test has three questions: two multiple-choice questions (select the correct answer) and one normal solve-the-challenge question. One of the seemingly simple multiple-choice questions got me stuck because my answer was not among the options.
 At the end of the practice test, I quickly put the code into "onlinegdb.com" to run it, and it gave one of the options as the answer. I was baffled because this is a basic question in C++ and I couldn't solve it. I wrote the code into Visual Studio on Windows (my daily dev environment) to debug and understand where I went wrong. Surprisingly, it gave me a different output.
 The question is given below:
 include <iostream>
 int main() {
  int x, y, z;
  x = 5;
  y = ++x * x--;
  z = ++y + --y;
  std::cout << "x: " << x << "\ny: " << y << "\nz: " << z;
  return 0;
 }
 What are the values of x, y, and z?
 a. 5, 35, 60
 b. 4, 25, 60
 c. 5, 30, 60
 d. 5, 35, 65
 Online GDB/Linux env GCC answer: 5, 30, 60
 Visual Studio answer: 5, 36, 72
 My initial answer: 5, 36, 73
 My answer trying to apply operator precedence: 5, 25, 51.
 Can anyone help explain the discrepancies between these output?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past I used AptCacherNg with squid-deb-proxy-client to automatically use the caching server on my machines, when I was in my home network and return to the default sources, when I am not.
 But since squid-deb-proxy-client does not exist in the sources of Debian bookworm, I was thinking, that maybe the whole setup could be considered outdated by now and there are better replacements.
 On the Debian wiki for AptCacherNg auto-apt-proxy is mentioned as an alternative to squid-deb-proxy-client. Is just using that enough? Or is AptCacherNg itself no longer state of the art and I should use something else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We'e gone beyond an era of game dev now where you can build a lot of a game through connecting black boxes. Whether the game is good or not is debatable, but it's reasonable to assume most of us are using black box concepts where our games rely on things, but we have no idea how these things work. Ask a Unity dev who attaches a CircleCollider2D to all their blobs to explain what a radian is, and it'll become clear that some don't have a clue, and may never actually need to know.
 Just to be clear, i'm not saying black boxes are bad. We can't build literally everything from scratch and there's no point in creating our own complex libraries when someone else has done all the heavy lifting, but what do you think is still good to learn in gamedev even though you could just rely on a black box?

 However, sometimes there're 1 to 4 additional functions I'd rather declare and define inside main.c file because I feel that creating additional .c+.h combinations for them is an overkill.
 Is it considered to be an OK practice to put some additional function definitions into main.c?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am new to C, not a total noob but I haven't worked on any large project. As I was implementing my own webserver at epollix, I needed a form parsing library that handles files well. I did not find any, or rather everything I tried failed miserably. First it was https://github.com/iafonov/multipart-parser-c but it uses callbacks and failed to handle binary files. Then tried to write it in rust and use it in C using the multipart create, it also failed. Perhaps its a skill issue or binary files are hard. Then I tried again with this https://github.com/abiiranathan/multipart_rs_multer project using the multer create in Rust. For some reason, It could not handle pdf and image uploads but plain/text files worked. I decided to implement it myself in C with a simple API, with minimal allocations, zero copy for file content.
 Check it out and be kind: https://github.com/abiiranathan/libmultipart
 As you can imagine, feedback is highly welcome.

The problem is, that the working directory is always set to the executable's directory but I want it to change to my preferred one. How would I do that directly when I run devenv? I know I can set it in the project settings after I have started visual studio but I sometimes delete the entire build file and I forget to change the working directory , after the rebuild, and I am left scratching my head sometimes on why certain things are not working. Isn't there a convenient way to just specify it with devenv?

No matter what C++ standard I tell the IDE to use it fails to recognize this way of importing the standard library.
 Is there a way to get this to work in my IDE or did I just miss something obvious here? I'm coming from a Python background if that helps and I've tried both Code::blocks and Clion and it's the same in both.

I've been seeing some really cool Golang CLI libraries and am tempted to try and port over my project (only ~10,000 lines, so nothing too crazy). Does this seem reasonable or no?
 Here's my github for context: https://github.com/AndrewRoe34/agile-planner
 Our current UI looks like it's from the 90s, and I'm definitely interested in learning more about Go (seems like a cool language if I'm being honest).

 Back then, recovering from the 2008 financial crisis, the demand for software engineers was sky high. You could apply for CS positions even from moderately ranked schools with a non-CS background. It was a time when Oracle would hire straight out of target schools with a GPA of 3.8+, no coding tests required. LeetCode had only 200 questions, and confidence was high.

Many times I have read that graphical programming had never worked out and there is no real alternative to scripting, but then there it was some programming with a graphical interface where connections and boxes was all you needed to program in C++.
 Is there any other environment beside the Unreal Engine where this Blueprints solution exists? As I know, Unreal Engine is the only environment doing it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(New account so HR can't identify me)
 Recently started an internship at a big tech (not FAANG but everyone would know the name) and yes, I went to search for all Linkedin profiles of other interns asa I had their names in the gc. Here's what I found:
  
Diversity: 60% are males. 40% white, 20% Asian, 15% black and mixed. I'm not good at telling Hispanic/Latin but at least 2 of them are. 
 
Degree: 20% Master (actually surprised me), 5-6 PhDs.
 
Prestige: actually 50-50 between T20s (both general and CS) and "smaller" schools. Most are still T100 or famous liberal arts, only 2 schools I have never heard of. 
 
Experience: Here's the part I found the most interesting. For T20 kids it's pretty varied between ex-FAANG and no previous internship at all. I don't count competitions or short programs at a company. I can't find Github or personal websites for half of no experience ones so no comment on their personal projects.
 
 For others, however, everyone (yes) had at least one internship. I also count internships at other countries which I assume are home countries of international students. 90% has Github/personal websites with all more than 2 personal projects. Again not sure if I couldn't find the rest 10% or they just don't have it.
 What does this mean? Probably nothing at all. And I'm sure not companies have the same statistics. Why do I post this? Well I want to share my 4-hour "research" with someone but don't want my friends to judge me. 
 But as a non-T20 student, I want to show that your school names won't stop you from landing big companies. However, you do have a higher bar to pass to be equivalent to prestige school kids. Again, just from my small sample size observation.
 P/s: All the numbers are rounded to the nearest 5%. There are 2-3 interns I couldn't find their Linkedin so I didn't included them. 
 P/s 2: Want to do international students but no idea how to identify it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 multicalc is a crate designed for scientific computing for single and multi-variable calculus
 Salient Features
  
Written in pure, safe rust
 no-std with zero heap allocations and no panics
 Trait-based generic implementation to support floating point and complex numbers
 Fully documented with code examples
 Comprehensive suite of tests for full code coverage, including all possible error conditions
 Supports linear, polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, and any complex equation you can throw at it, of any number of variables!
  
Thank you to everyone who gave me feedback last time. Version 0.4.0 has these changes:
  
Crate is finally completely no-std.
 Moved some error checks to compile time.
 Added default functions to all modules, known to never cause any error, for users who just want the solution and don't care about the computational parameters.
 Added "custom" functions for more advanced users who still want to tweak the computation parameters.
 Updated documentation and examples.
  
I love to hear your feedback. Are there any features you would like to be added? What do you think of the overall API?
 github: https://github.com/kmolan/multicalc-rust
 crate: https://crates.io/crates/multicalc
 Please let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I checked a company's job posts and saw that over 90% new open positions are outside of United States. However, close to 70% of their revenue (over $2B) is generated from within the US. They had over 100 software engineer jobs open in India alone with some in Latin countries, eastern Europe. Maybe about 5 US based positions. This is a specific example, but seems to be a trend.
 The number of companies outsourcing is large enough, so it can be said they are creating artificial unemployment among US tech workers (particularly recent graduates). Shouldn't companies hire people in a country proportional to the generated revenue?

I know this will work against me big time and I am not trying to immediately bounce back to a decent paying job. But I have always defaulted to taking jobs that pay low for a SWE anyway, so that isn't really new to me. I always set my salary goal based on how much I can survive that and add some extra. Unfortunately you can't be super modest with your salary in this career, because low paying jobs are generally also some of the worst to work in.
 But can you find a sliver lining to a low paying job (other than, it's better than unemployment)? Given my situation, I know I cannot compete on skills or marketability- I don't have much that is in demand today- I can only compete on price. If you had to look for jobs that pay below average what can you expect that you could at least capitalize on to progress your career further? I'm looking for dev jobs that few people want and pay low, but could still help your career in some way.

In my firmware ive tried booting to different options but the same thing would happen for the most part. I tried finding stuff online but I couldnt find this happening to people who just installed an update. I didnt change any critical system settings so I have no idea how this happened.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first assassin's creed back in 2007 had a large city as it's setting. You could climb the tallest tower and see all the building rendered, admittedly in low LOD, but convincingly forming a large city. Wander the streets and see dozens of NPCs doing stuff and they react to your actions as well. I ask this because I recently prototyped a procedural city populated by similar NPCs with basic behaviors. But the performance was not that great, even though I was using a modern engine and have a decent hardware. I'm not denying that I might have done poor optimization, I am asking what techniques did Assassin's creed use? Occlusion culling, LoD and batching is not cutting it for my prototype.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently started using C and Cpp more seriously, and that results in the need to learn CMake. I'm working with VSCode on Windows, installed vscpkg few days ago, and fighting a battle of my life trying to setup either sdl2 or glfw3. Where can I read more about what generators to use and when? I know I can choose between VS ones, Ninja and NMakefiles on windows. But both Ninja and NMake can never find either sdl or glfw, and I can't seem to figure out why. It always says "following files considered but discarded (64bit)". I made sure my triplet is set to x64 too. I don't want to use microsoft's compiler, as I'll probably make a jump to linux when I get a new pc.
 I need to understand how those generators work, their compatibility, when to use which and how to resolve my issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the NES PPU I'm confused on how the sprite pixels are combined with the background pixels during shifting/multiplexing to determine pixel color. The diagram here is... reasonably clear in showing how the background pixel is chosen via nametable/attribute fetches and scroll selection. But as far as I can tell it hand-waves exactly what the sprite pixel input is, simply listing [Sprites 0..7] as the input to the priority multiplexer. But what is that input?
 I've also read through Sprite Evaluation several times and I understand the relationship between OAM and secondary OAM; the latter holds the 8 sprites chosen for the upcoming scanline. But clearly it isn't the direct input into pixel selection because it's reset in the first 64 cycles of the current scanline. The details section lists that the secondary OAM data is "fetched" on cycles 257-320, but fetched to where?
 In javidx9's series he uses a shift register per scanline sprite (for 8 in total) which seems logical, it's essentially an extension of how background tiles work, but he seems to present this as the most straightforward way to do it in his emulator rather than a reflection of anything in the underlying hardware.
 The nesdev wiki doesn't seem to document what that sprite input is. Is this documented somewhere and I'm missing it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question for pentesters/hackers/etc
 If you are sitting on a compromised Windows endpoint waiting for any privileged user to log in, basically sitting around causing minor glitches in the hopes that I.T. logs in to check it out, what would you do with this:
  
User just logged in, they are a local admin. They were made a local admin by a group policy applied to all end-user workstations 
 So you are ready to take over the network, except...
 
 The same group policy also gives them "Deny access to this computer from the network" everywhere. 
 So you can't move laterally with just this account, but maybe you're going to harvest their password to at least elevate on other workstations you have a non-elevated foothold on?
 
 No password was used; smart card is required for interactive logon. 
 But maybe you can do something with their NTLM secret at least?
 
 They are in the "Protected Users" group and cannot authenticate with NTLM.
  
The best I can think of is you might be able to steal their PIN out of the LSA if credential guard is not enabled, and maybe whip up some custom method of proxying the smart card to another host, but that might be tough to implement given that the account's only value is local admin and if you can install a tampered smartcard driver on the destination machine, you were already local admin.
 Am I missing something? I only ask because many people have said the only fully safe way for a technician to be able to elevate to local admin on an end-user device is by looking up and typing a complex LAPS password, and if that's true, this alternative (a smart card with a dedicated in-person-only admin account) must be broken somehow.

 Another PR to bump the artifact wherever used
  
Sometimes it goes a few more steps. I'm not sure if the problem is with the convoluted mess the internal libraries are or the way cicd has been established
 This doesn't necessarily have to be internal libraries. Perhaps a general problem statement is, how do you propagate newly generated artifact IDs. Is it worth automating them to auto apply wherever necessary or should bumps must go through PR as any other change?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I was looking for suggestions on this implementation of a thread-safe stack data structure using a coarse-grained lock: https://godbolt.org/z/vr9o894GY
 My ideas for the API were:
  
I wanted to somehow provide peeking into the stack in a thread-safe way, so I decided to return a std::unique_lock alongside the reference. I realize that this can be misused, but oh well.
 Provide pushing and popping as usual, with pop returning the owned value.
 Remove is_empty/empty, because I don't think they're that useful and can be approximated using the other functions anyway.
  
I don't have exception safety for types that can throw on construction among other cases, but here's a first attempt at something.
 Additionally, would it have been possible to provide a single implementation of push using some template feature I don't know about? Because the code is nearly identical bar the call to std::move.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, a very long time ago (probably around 10 years actually) I used to work a bit with system called Microsoft Dynamics CRM, which has in my opinion a very interesting way of querying data called QueryExpression, an class which allowed to write queries to the system in OOP fashion. It was quite nice to work with, and I always had an idea to build something similar but for SQL (the system was actually using custom query language called FetchXML). Here is the reference to their concept - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.query.queryexpression?view=dataverse-sdk-latest
 So finally after some spare nights I've built this tiny library SQLQueryExpression NET - https://github.com/skinex/SqlQueryExpression.NET At the moment, this library is quite basic, it could handle SELECTS, WHERE conditions (nested conditions as well) JOINS (LEFT and INNER) as well as UNION and EXCEPT ALL. I do have a plans to add support for queries listed in Not Supported Queries section at some point.
 If you find this library or perhaps this approach interesting, feel free to give it a try, report any issues or contribute to the current codebase :)
 PS: I'm aware that this library is not nearly as powerful as EF Core (or even EF), or SQLKata, it's just demonstrates a way of writing queries in object oriented manner. I'm also don't really want to debate about functional vs object oriented way of building queries, I'm pretty sure everyone has very strong opinions on this matter, but it wasn't a point of this tool to prove anything regarding this topic.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't find anything super recent that dealt with this, so I figured I'd ask... apologies if this is the wrong place for this question! I'll remove this post if so.
 I haven't done any C or C++ since 2013-ish and want to pick the languages back up. Back then I had just finished school and briefly worked a job at a small shop where, being the lone C++ dev working entirely on my own, I learned nothing about best practices or anything, so I basically just installed dependencies locally and linked against them, and maybe ran valgrind every once in a blue moon, etc. I figure maybe that wasn't the best way to handle things, or even if it was maybe things have changed since then.
 Anyway, I was recently offered some work on a project and one of the requirements is that it must be either C or C++ and want to take a look at both again so I can decide which one I should use (plus I'm interested in exploring the game development field), so my question is: what's the most popular setup for a C/C++ dev environment? I'm talking besides IDE's/Text Editors, also tools for dependency management, static analysis, memory debugging/analysis, linters, etc. Basically anything people who are pros use to boost their productivity especially when they might be using the same PC for working on several projects... I'm on Windows 11, but also have WSL2 set up with Ubuntu, which means either Windows or Ubuntu setups should work for me. Thanks in advance!

 The recruiter made it clear that they want me bad. 
 The initial 145k is because I gave them that number (I fked up). But I’m sure they’re willing to increase it because they specifically said to let them know if I get an offer “a lot higher”. 
 I have no other offer. I bluffed. How much is “a lot” in your eyes. How much should I say I got offered so they can counter with their best offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! How hard do you think it will be to create a Game Boy emulator using Circle for bare metal Raspberry Pi? I'm quite new to emulation and a complete newbie if it comes to Raspberry Pi. 
 It's supposed to be the topic of my graduation project, so I'll have about 3-4 months to do that. I know for sure that I'll be creating a GB emulator, I just need a little "something" to come with it so it'll distinguish my project from others. I've also though about "just" emulating GBC or GBA, but I'm afraid GBA will be too much for me.
 I need your opinion on the matter. I'm also open to any ideas you might throw my way.
 Have a good day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working on a backend call today and had the equivalent of:
 var result = service.UndoStuff(selectedBatch); if (result.HasError) MessageHelper.Alert(result.Message); 
 Now pretty much all of our service calls return OperationResult<T> and this one in particular returns OperationResult<ResultDTO>. I needed to split this up to two different calls depending on the state of the batch so I did
 OperationResult<ResultDTO> result; if (selectedBatch.Status == 'PENDING') { result = service.Recall(selectedBatch); { else { result = service.UndoStuff(selectedBatch); } if (result.HasError) MessageHelper.Alert(result.Message); 
 Low and behold - red squigly under "OperationResult". It was an easy fix, I just had to add a USING for the Namespace at the top of the source, but can anyone explain, using small words and visual aids, why I don't need to include the Namespace when I use "var result", but do need to include it when referencing the data type explicitly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have written a basic PPU that only draws the background tileset but am experiencing an odd bug (I am testing using the TETRIS rom).
 When drawing the background I get a frame buffer of:
 https://preview.redd.it/0b6bpo2ru67d1.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=a682d7196805b23bf6ed0e317773b1493c65ad67
 This is due to the tileset start address being wrong. I determine what the address should be via
 u16 bg_window_tile_data_start_address(Memory_Bus *memory_bus, bool *signed_identifiers) { if (memory_bus->read_u8(LCD_CONTROL_REGISTER) & 0x10) { *signed_identifiers = false; return 0x8000; } else { *signed_identifiers = true; return 0x8800; } } 
 If I swap the condition then I get the expected behavior and I can see the TETRIS copyright notice at the start.
 https://preview.redd.it/3atdpl78l67d1.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=c46e9d0d9f4c02ca351f23f42dd11c1f1700ebc7
 Looking at the pan docs it says that for bit 4 in the LCD control register the values correspond to the following start addresses: 0 = 8800–97FF; 1 = 8000–8FFF. which doesn't align with the behavior I am observing.
 Another odd behavior I notice is that my image flashes and I am not sure what is causing it to do so.

 I’ve got 2*1tb NVME, and 2tb SSD.
 I’m aiming to make the most out of my space and really harness the full potential of the 2TB. My plan is to merge the two NVMe drives and set up Debian 12 minimal with GNOME.
 Since I’ll be experimenting and tweaking settings, I’d like to ensure I can revert to a previous state if needed. Ideally, I’d use the 2TB SSD as a reliable restore point to load the OS back to a functioning state.
 Could you guide me on how to achieve this setup? I’m focusing on both performance and having a solid backup solution.

 Looks like llvm/clang is maybe the way to go…
 Hi all, V8 will follow Chromium's lead and will stop providing infrastructure for GCC builds. We will still accept patches from the community but we will not invest in keeping this build functioning. To give projects time to adjust, we will perform this change after V8 version 13.0 in September 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[before i start, i want to say i have nothing against rust or using it, in fact, it's one of my favorite languages of all time. i just don't get why some people treat a program being written in rust as a feature of the program? i understand if it's something where memory issues really could cause big problems like an operating system or a firewall or something like that, but i've seen people use rust as a reason to use something like bat over cat, leftwm, etc., and i just don't get it. could someone shed some light on why people treat rust like that? is it just fanaticism, or is there another reason? again, this post isn't out of any hatred for rust, i'm just confused.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Load balancers, historically meant one thing: a hardware or a software component that simply handles balancing the load among different servers in a distributed architecture. Today, the meaning completely changed. The different cloud providers have 4 or 5 different load balancer implementations which are all used for different purposes such as TCP connection balancing, HTTP/s balancing, TLS termination, something called Gateway balancing, etc. etc. Isn't the term overloaded? For example, I don't even understand how we came to a definition that a load balancer must be able to do TLS termination. It just does not make sense when you simply think about the definition. 
 So, here is my question; if a new cloud provider popped up today and made an announcement "X Cloud now has Cloud Load Balancer", what do you expect them to have? What are the must haves of a load balancer? Would a simple Layer 4 load balancer suffice or everyone needs that Application Load Balancer for path based load balancing, Let's Encrypt integration, DDoS protection, etc.?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got an internship in QA automation! Applied in late December, got an offer by February, and started last month. It seems like a great company so far, the pay is decent (great for me but decent for the field), and the level of challenge is perfect (enough that you learn a lot every time you do something, but not enough that you will constantly have to do overtime). 
 All things considered, I'm a pretty mediocre candidate. So it's possible!
 I took a few CS classes while pursuing my first degree (totally unrelated field), did most of freeCodeCamp, experimented a little with game dev, but don't have any big finished projects on my GitHub. Did some Python scripting and Power Automate at my last full-time gig, making work for everyone a bit easier. Currently a Software Engineering student, but only about 40% of the way through the program.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone. I was wondering if I could get another perspective on this LINQ query I have written. To me it seems pretty straight forward, but seemingly it cannot be translated into SQL.
 For some context, I have the data structure which follows a 1:N relationship all the way down:
 Organization -> List of Departments -> List of Employees -> List of Tasks
 I have a table, Errors, whose records can be related to any of the above hierarchical records via the RecordId foreign key.
 For my usecase, I simply need to get the Organization, and a count of all errors for the Organization and all child records, and then include only the Error entities for the Organization itself.
 ```csharp var query = _context.Organizations .Where(o => o.Id == request.OrganizationId) .Select(o => new OrganizationWithErrorsDto( o.Id,
 o.Name,
 _context.Errors .Count(e => e.RecordId == o.Id || o.Departments.Any(d => d.Id == e.RecordId) || o.Departments.Any(d => d.Employees.Any(emp => emp.Id == e.RecordId)) || o.Departments.Any(d => d.Employees.Any(emp => emp.Tasks.Any(t => t.Id == e.RecordId)))), _context.Errors .Where(ae => e.RecordId == o.Id || o.Departments.Any(d => d.Id == e.RecordId) || o.Departments.Any(d => d.Employees.Any(emp => emp.Id == e.RecordId)) || o.Departments.Any(d => d.Employees.Any(emp => emp.Tasks.Any(t => t.Id == e.RecordId)))), ) ) .OrderBy(o => o.Name);
 return query .ProjectTo<OrganizationDto>(_mapper.ConfigurationProvider);
 public record OrganizationWithErrorsDto( Guid Id, string? Name, int? TotalErrorCount, IEnumerable<Error> Errors); ```
  
Am I doing anything obviously wrong?
 
How can I write this in a way that can be translated?
 
Any advice/resources for how I can troubleshoot/think about this kind of problem in the future?
  
I find this pretty confusing because this seems like a fairly simple query and something that someone would naturally do with LINQ.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been making some projects over the years (in C and other programming languages) but every project has different requirements and specifics. This has been nice in that it built a versatility when facing new problems but I feel I have become somewhat a "Jack of All Trades, Master of None".
 Recently I have been thinking about what to do about it. First, I don't have a good grasp of the fundamentals (computer organization, assembly, operating systems, algorithms and data structures). So my plan is to try and watch some lectures/read some books on those topics. But I still need to practice.
 What if I practice the same limited set of problems for a while to help me abosrb the fundamentals before moving back to building a bigger project that uses those fundamentals. For example, I could choose the most common data structures and algorithms and just practice implementing them from scratch until they become so easy I almost don't have to think about them.
 What do you think about this approach? Have you tried something like this before? Do you think it has merit?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://godbolt.org/z/zqv694qr3
 for fun and practice I decided to try implementing this dvec. I got it seemingly working, then started writing some more stuff to use and test it, at which point I started getting the error "malloc(): corrupted top size". I've got a line commented out on 92 which if you uncomment it (and comment the other one) the program runs without dying (but still isn't correct).
 Anyway, I don't know why this call to memcpy isn't working. I thought it might be because somewhere I got mixed up on size as referring to number of chars vs number of elements, but I've gone over everything and don't see that problem.
 Anyone see it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hope everyone enjoyed their weekend.
 This past Friday was my two year anniversary with my first full time junior software developer position. I've never done C# and I was mainly front end with JavaScript for some enterprise applications for the first year and a half. I wanted to do back end development since I was more proficient with front end and have never explored back end development at the job at all.
 This past March, I made an appointment to see both the manager and tech lead and asked if they have back end projects where I can learn and contribute to the team. They were delighted to set me up with a Microsoft & Pluralsight training program and follow through the lessons. Fast forward, I was recently assigned with a project using Entity Framework to create some repositories and boy I have never been stumped on an assignment, ever. My Imposter syndrome was creeping up at times and I felt defeated not knowing what to do.
 The team and tech lead who has way more experience in Entity Framework were very helpful every time I ran to a problem. I asked what I could do outside of work to improve my C# skills and they suggested Pluralsight foundations and Microsoft's C# documentation, which are helpful. I bought C# Player's guide a while back that I'm currently working through after work and it seems very helpful.
 It was the best decision of my (career) life because I felt that I was not progressing as a software engineer and was doing simple front end assignments. Backend is a whole different world. I'm currently getting my behind kicked doing Entity Framework but I'm learning so much about C#, the framework, and what I need to work on. If anyone else felt like they are not progressing, ask you manager to see what you could do that is more challenging or an area where you don't have expertise in and learn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to come up with ways to make variadic functions safer to use so that people can no longer get away with passing invalid format strings to functions like printf (like printf("℅d ℅d", 98); which clearly is undefined behaviour).
 Now the main concern is printf somehow needs to know the number of variadic arguments it has been passed so that it can verify if the format string is indeed valid. However I don't see any way of doing so. Furthermore, I can't even find much documentation on how each compiler passes variadic arguments to variadic functions.
 Can anyone please point me to some relevant documentation for variadic functions? If the implementation is architecture dependent then it would also really help if someone points me to x86 specific docs.
 EDIT: I am aware that gcc and some good compilers warn about formatting errors like in the above example, I just really want to move the check to runtime so that compilers which do not offer this facility do not cause problems and variadic functions become safer to use in general.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is your view on deleting code? How often do you do it? Have you experience on the long term consequences of deleting code? Do you feel like effort spent deleting code before it becomes a mess is worth it? Are you totally against code deleting, and prefer just some deprecation method?
 Of course, the code is never REALLY deleted, it stays forever on SCM history, so this is not a super important decision, but I still want to start a discussion on this topic. Recently I have been maintaining a quite seasoned system that has been migrated to new versions, from JSF to REST + Angular, features have been replaced by different ones many times, etc. There is a lot of dead code that isnt used anymore, and sometimes slows down new implementations, so I started to slowly delete it as I was certain.
 Although I am 100% sure that I should be deleting the code in my situation and this effort will pay off, I started thinking that if I were the one that made those changes this wouldnt be so obvious.
 So, what do you think about this? Do you have a strong opinion on this? Or its just whatever?

 I have an issue where I think that the visual studio optimizer cuts trailing \0 in a string.
 The following example demonstrates the issue:
  uint32\_t switchValue = htonl(command); uint32\_t testValue = '/a\\0\\0'; uint32\_t isValue = 0x002f6100; uint32\_t isValue2 = '/a\\0'; uint32\_t shouldValue = 0x2f610000; if (testValue == isValue && testValue == isValue2) printf("Stop doing this!\\n"); if (testValue == shouldValue) printf("Pleas do this instead!\\n"); 
 The software prints "Stop doing this!". I turned all optimization off.
 Does anyone have a clue why?

Lambdas are able to take the reference or a copy of everything in the current scope. Lambdas are also syntatic sugar to create a structure with an overloaded operator ().

 I lately see many people trying Linux or thinking about switching, which has made me think about my own experience. After about 4 years daily driving different distros (Opensuse Tumbleweed for the past 2), I have to say that right now my experience is better than it has ever been.
 I can do pretty much anything I want in my mid-tier laptop: Producing music, audio and video content, gaming, watching movies, videos, listening to music locally and from a remote server, using VMs to test stuff and easily share folders between host and guest, managing my notes, documents and files, rewiring the audio however I want thanks to pipewire, using different bluetooth devices with zero …]]></summary>

 Let me give you a backatory: my cousin works for that company and he knows I'm planning to start computer science university in the next few months, so he invited me to have a stage in the company where he works. The cool thing? If I prove myself in the next 3/6 months I could already be hired (he managed to achieve this though he already had a basic knowledge).
 Main problem? I don't know anything about programming, like totally 0. I'm willing to put in every drop of water and blood for this. My plan is not to become a C# master but to at least know the necessary to produce things.
 Do you have any tips? How can I get the grasps as fast as possible? Have you ever done something like that? Is it even possible if I create a crazy good learning schedule?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently trying to compile a library for MacOS that was originally written for Windows. This library's source makes use of lots of Windows secure functions like sscanf_s(), _snprintf_s(), fscanf_s() 
 Obviously, clang is having a hard time recognising these functions.
 Note: This library is still in use by other people in my team so I cannot just haphazardly replace all these functions from the code.
 I tried writing macros to replace these functions with more standard fucntions like so:
 #define _snprintf_s(buffer, size, count, format, ...) snprintf(buffer, size, format, VA_ARGS) #define sscanf_s sscanf 
 but the format args used by scanf functions are weird to write macros for since they are in this pattern:
 format_arg1, size[if format_arg1 is string], format_arg2, format_arg3, size[if format_arg3 is string] ... so on ... 
 I have considered the following solutions:
  
Writing a macro to catch these windows functions.
 defining functions that do the same thing and wrapping it around an ifdef for my use.
  
I am open to other solutions too, Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, in one of the projects that I am working right now, I have updated the compiler from Clang to GCC and some tests started to break.
 I was able to reduce the code to this sample https://godbolt.org/z/E7zK17ahc
 After some digging, I now understand that the order of the evaluation of the parameters is different between GCC and Clang that leads to result of the execution being different.
 I work on a MacBook M2 and I was testing the compiler changes on a Docker image running a cross compiler to x86-64. This is not a great setup fro debugging.
 So I tried to reproduce this on my Mac, I installed GCC 14, and after recompiling everything the tests don't fail...
 Since I also have cross compilation images for armv5 and armv7, I tried the code on those and the tests also don't fail.
 Even if I try to compile the test code shown above on x86-64, it fails, but on armv5 and armv7 it works.
 The question is why?
 I would expect that the evaluation order to be done by the front-end of the compiler. But it doesn't seem to be the case. 
 Any idea of what's causing this difference?

 The server is pretty basic right now, but it handles:
  
Easy routing: Easily define routes with one line or using attributes on your controllers.
 Flexible Middleware: Inject logic to handle authentication, logging, and more with global and route-specific middleware.
 Session management: Track user data across multiple requests.
 ORM: Effortless sqlite database interactions with simple code using code-first approach.
 Content negotiation: Deliver data in JSON, XML, or other formats based on what the client wants.
 Authentication: Built in JWT Authentication with user registration and login
  
It was a great exercise to understand how these things work under the hood, and I'm learning a lot about web development in the process.

 By using paretos law what 20% of the modern .net will get me 80% results, and avoid making me look ignorant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, recently I joined a company as a software engineer and was told that i’ll be developing some in-house applications.
 Turns out, the company has literally zero tech. Meaning no code repo, no pipelines. The only tech they have was previously done by a vendor to create their current application which is currently running on Azure AKS.
 Long story short, I felt that before I can even do any development, a proper dev environment is required, meaning owning code repo, CI/CD pipelines till deployment (staging/prod)
 I have roughly pieced out the picture and would appreciate everyone’s input on whether this is feasible.
 Git repo - Gitlab. Even though i’ve never used gitlab before, it seems to be the best/easiest to conduct CI/CD.
 In the gitlab-ci yml, Im thinking of having diff stages like testing, before building and pushing the image to a container registry.
 The container registry I’m thinking of using Azure Container Registry since the company already uses Azure. 
 From there, I believe AKS can pull the image and deploy as a Kubernetes cluster.
 As for the infra, Im thinking of using Terraform for proper versioning. Ive also read about K9 which helps manage the K8s.
 So in short, if my understanding is correct, i can have tests, build image, push image to Container Registry, deploy and run the image as Kubernetes in AKS, all within the Gitlab-ci yml? If that is so, gitlab is really impressive.
 Did I miss any crucial parts in this pipeline? Im not trained in this but I still want to give it a try, since it’s something useful too.
 Would appreciate any inputs 🙏🏻

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 This thursday I have a C technical test where I'll be shown some C code in which there will be mistakes and I should identify, discuss what is wrong with this code and bring some fix to it.
 I've been working 6 years with C code but I want to prepare the best for this test. The job is in the automotive industry and during a previous interview, the recruiter insisted on the fact that I'll be working large team development (the code they are working on is shared by 500 devs). 
 Do you know any website or do you have any code example containing mistakes that I can train on ? 
 I'm thinking about helping people stucked on stackOverflow too. 
 Thank you for your help :)

 Fast forward to today, I see ppl claiming AI in their titles. When I inspect their repos, it just looks like they're creating APIs to a cloud ML service that provides pre-built models and sending the response back to the client.
 Maybe I'm missing something but beyond maybe curating a dataset, I'm not really seeing any actual AI concepts being applied?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I was reading the book "Effective C++ - scott meyers", and it had suggested to use const T instead of #define, and the fact that we usually declare constant in header files, etc. But I am a little confused now; Should I declare constant in header files using extern and then initialize it in a seperate .cpp file, or just define and initialize the constant fully in the header file?
 The first solution
 Well, I mean something like this:
 ```cpp // consts.hpp
 pragma once
 extern const float PI = 3.14; ```
 cpp // consts.cxx const float PI = 3.14; 
 Well, already I am uncomfortable with the fact that I can mistakenly initialize this constant in two seperate files and get a linker error. But it seems more logical to keep all declrations in the header and have this seperation.
 The second solution
 Ok, the next solution is to define everything and initialize in the header like this:
 ```cpp // consts.hpp
 pragma once
 const float PI = 3.14; ```
 It seems a better solution, but I kinda just don't like initializing in the header file; Also I am not sure how exactly #pragma once works, so, could it lead to some linker errors if I include consts.hpp in several files? As long as I know, it's gonna copy the content of header to files, does it mean I'll get several definitions of the const PI in multiple files? Each object will get its own constant? Or it corrects it and it's not just a simple straight forward copy?
 Thanks for your opinions.
 Edit: I am also curious about your opinion about inline variables and constexpr for this thing.

 But anyways I found a hack, instead of making a game, we just perfectly simulate every element on the periodic table and give it a few hundred billion years or whatever. 
 I'll only be able to take the first 10,000 volunteers, if my projections are correct, that will leave us all with about a billion dollars when it comes time to rev share.
 Also, I have never even used a computer before so you'll have to do all the work but I'll get the most money cause only ideas matter, anyone can do the stupid grunt work you morons do.
 Any takers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've been working on translating this kupyna hash implementation to rust:
 Kupyna Reference Implementation However, there is a constant defined here called Rows, which is used for the Column size of the struct inside the kupyna struct (in the kupyna.h file). In the kupyna.c file, there are functions (like void subBytes) which take a 2d array with the rows constant as column size, and then a column variable on the side.
 I've spent way too much time thinking about this and need some outside persepctive, this is definitely a case of the constant being misnamed right? like I'm not going insane here or the code is using some arcane magic to define its 2d arrays
 Edit: typo

 I personally feel it’s a lot harder to get responses from the job applications now comparing to 2021. I am a U.S. citizen and it’s already pretty hard, I can’t imagine how much more stressful it is for people on H1b especially if impacted by layoffs.
 Just a reference, I am getting about 1 response out of maybe 10-15 applications right now. I remember the number was a lot higher in 2021.

I'm not exactly leveraging any in-demand technologies in my job so that's not gonna be very helpful when I try and find a new job in the future. I've been here for 6 months but I can already tell this is all my job has going on. Part of me has regret but I know that it would have been a good move to stay unemployed any longer. I am curious how others have been doing since graduating in May 2023 in particular those that graduated with no internships.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I ran into a dead end attempting to figure out how to use installed libraries and manage library dependencies taking the version into consideration.
 Consider the following:
 - I've made a LibA project and turned it into a library installed in a custom folder in my workspace(.install folder)
 - LibA has two versions: 1.0.0. and 2.0.0
 - LibB is another library also installed in this custom folder in the workspace but it depends on the LibA 1.0.0
 - Finally, an App depends on the LibA 2.0.0 and the LibB 0.1.0
 The main issue is that the App is linking the LibA 2.0.0 while LibB also depends on the LibA, but the LibB is not using the LibA 1.0.0.
 Has anyone ever encountered something similar? Any thoughts or recommendations on how to resolve this matter would be greatly appreciated.
 I'm not sure whether or not the find_package is the better option here.
 NOTE: I'll let below a small piece of the CMakeLists.txt file to help 
 App/CMakeLists.txt:
 LibA dependency
 set(LIB_A__VERSION 2.0.0)
 list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "$ENV{MY_WORKSPACE}/.install/LibA/${LIB_A__VERSION}") find_package(LibA ${LIB_A__VERSION} EXACT REQUIRED) target_link_libraries(${EXECUTABLE_NAME} PRIVATE LibA)
 # LibB dependency
 set(LIB_B__VERSION 0.1.0) list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "$ENV{MY_WORKSPACE}/.install/LibB/${LIB_B__VERSION}")
 find_package(LibB ${LIB_B__VERSION} EXACT REQUIRED) target_link_libraries(${EXECUTABLE_NAME} PRIVATE LibB)
 LibB/CMakeLists.txt:
 LibA dependency
 set(LIB_A__VERSION 1.0.0)
 list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "$ENV{MY_WORKSPACE}/.install/LibA/${LIB_A__VERSION}") find_package(LibA ${LIB_A__VERSION} EXACT REQUIRED) target_link_libraries(${EXECUTABLE_NAME} PRIVATE LibA)

I run unRaid as a hypervisor and PCIe passthrough for GPU and a dedicated USB controller. I believe this is not a cause here as, from what I have read doing research, my issue happens on bare metal systems as well. I can also confirm I have the audio device of the GPU passed through properly as function 0x01 and the main GPU as function 0x00 and confirmed proper with lspci.

 My troubles are the following:
  
If I want to add information to an existing exception type, say std::out_of_range, inheriting feels wrong due to if something catches the base type up stream when that's unintended, it may cause problems.
 If I decide to not inherit from std::out_of_range for my custom out_of_range error, now I have 2 types sharing the exact same semantics as each other and the opposite issue of the previous, what if it's intended the base class gets caught, so that also feels wrong to me.

 I've come across various issues, most of them are with nautilus being different.
 the latest issue is with the "ctrl + backspace" key combo, in ubuntu it always deleted a "word" to the left of the current cursor position, no matter the applciation.
 but with debian, it somehow depends on the application;
 nautilus, handbrake (flatpak) and Text Editor don't do it, they only delete a single character to the left.
 firefox, vs code, libreoffice writer, telegram desktop (flatpak) do it correctly and delete a whole "word".
 can i fix this? how?
 is this an issue with gnome? or some desktop environment?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I inherited a C library that I have no control over. In that library, there is one struct, and one function that I really care about. To simplify my problem, assume I have a struct:
 struct oldStruct {
 // other stuff
 unsigned char* bigarray;
 };
 Later on, I need to pass an array of oldStructs to the function I care about like so:
 coolFunction(const oldStruct* structarrayptr, // other stuff);
 So my question is basically, how can I C++ify things for safety. I already have a vector<oldStruct> and then pass to coolFunction(vector<oldStruct>.data(), ...) and that all works. But I'd really like to somehow wrap the unsigned char* bigarray in a unique_ptr, and I can't figure out how.
 I even tried making
 struct newStruct{
 // same other stuff
 std::unique_ptr<unsigned char> bigarray;
 };
 which is already dumb for just duplicating code. I was able to construct my vector<newStruct> and use it elsewhere and everything worked great, but the issue was when I tried to pass to coolFunction that it failed. There was no casting I could figure out that would cast newStruct to oldStruct. The issue I guess is that C++ isn't smart enough to use unique_ptr.get() to get the dumb pointer.
 What is the "right" way to deal with this situation? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm making a game in C++ using Raylib. Currently i have a HitboxComponent class. Anything that is collidable will have an hitbox object. Currently i have a CollisionSystem class that holds a map of a CollidableType (for example, BOX, ENEMY, etc...) and a pointer to the HitboxComponent. I iterate over the map checking for collisions. I thought this would work, but now I have a problem. What if I wanna make a bullet for example? Since i only have the hitbox I can't access the actual object.
 I thought of making an entity or collidable class and add a onCollide virtual function and pass them instead of the HitboxComponents. Is that a good idea?

 The role is something I’m interested in pursuing. But I only have 3 years experience as a dev and worry I haven’t a solid enough foundation in tech to jump 
 For a little more context I have a degree in Business Info Systems so the VP thinks I’d be a solid fit for the PM side .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I would like to initiate a discussion about a software architecture case I am currently facing at the company I work for, and get your opinions on how I can improve the application's architecture.
 I built an application in Java 17, using Spring Boot 2.7, about 6 months ago. This application handles approximately 20k RPM, with an average response time of 60-80ms. As the initiative for which this application was proposed started generating a lot of money, the product team decided that this same functionality should be available in other parts of the main sales site. This change will cause the application to receive around 500k RPM in the coming months.
 This application does not involve any heavy processing; it only makes API calls to fetch delivery information and returns it. A significant part of the response time is due to waiting for other applications. With this increase in traffic, I am exploring how to improve its performance to avoid issues and reduce response time. We have a load balancer and instance scaling system that will manage the platform.
 I plan to upgrade the application to use Spring 3.2 and Java 21, so I can use Java's virtual threads to improve throughput, as we have some parallel calls.
 One of my colleagues suggested that we change the application from Java to Go, but I believe that in this case, we would not have significant gains, except for faster scaling. I think this because the application's workflow mainly involves waiting for responses from other APIs. What do you think about this? Would it be worth switching this application to Go? What gains would we have?
 Instance resources are not a problem because we use the smallest machine available on our platform, and even so, it has plenty of resources left over

 app.MapHealthChecks( "/api/health", new HealthCheckOptions { ResponseWriter = UIResponseWriter.WriteHealthCheckUIResponse } ) .AddEndpointFilter<ApiKeyEndpointFilter>();

 app.MapHealthChecks( "/api/health", new HealthCheckOptions { ResponseWriter = UIResponseWriter.WriteHealthCheckUIResponse } ) .AddEndpointFilter(new ApiKeyEndpointFilter(builder.Configuration)); 
 Which is fine in my example, but what if I wanted to resolve other dependencies like db context for example? That's when it becomes hard. I just don't understand why there's no such overload like .AddEndpointFilter<T>() on IEndpointConventionBuilder.
 What's the best way to go about it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a while now, I've been trying to find more up-to-date alternatives based on Debian, so far I've found three of them interesting:
 Kali As it contains a multitude of software focused on cybersecurity, many associate it with activities focused on the same field, this is true, but another truth is the repository is full of useful for a common user and updated software.For gnome lovers, this seems to be the only one, besides Ubuntu, that has a more up-to-date gnome, apart from the fact that Nautilus is outdated for reasons I don't know. Until then, it seems like a better alternative. 1. Imports Debian packages, that is, it has its own repository; 2. It is officially Rolling Release, unlike Debian Testing; and 3. Is maintained by the community;
 Siduction To be honest, I can't say much about this one, but it looks like it's a Rolling Release that uses unstable repositories. It is not so autonomous from Debian that one can even question the reason why use it instead of unstable itself?
 Ubuntu There's not much that can be said, it's an excellent choice. Many who don't recommend Ubuntu do so because of snap, but the truth is Ubuntu is still a great choice even or especially without snap. It's not that it's about hating snaps or not, but if canonical allowed the community to keep .deb versions of the snaps they took down, that would be the best. But users can stay out of these snaps, for example, for FF using the Mozilla PPA, and I'm not a fan of having multiple software sources on the system, it's an easy opening for problems.
 Do you know of another with the following characteristics?: 1. It's a community project; 2. Focuses exclusively on the .deb format; 3. Instead of using direct Debian repositories, import from salsa into it's own repositories; 4. It is released every 6 months or a year, or even is a Rolling Release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I installed Linux (specifically Arch + GNOME) about a week ago and I am very positively surprised!
 I always thought that Linux was for people who know what they are doing (🤓) and have a specific reason for doing it. Out of curiosity, I separated a small partition so that I could test whether I could even install it and use it for a few days, and a day later I decided to format my entire second drive (~500gb) on which I only had a few games and so far I have no reason to go back to Windows! Really, every application I wanted to go/install worked, there are so many guides and videos on YouTube explaining how to do various things.
 I can understand that some people may not like the fact that sometimes you have to type something into the console, but for me it's not a big deal to learn a dozen commands. I really see that this is a great community and the openness of the system is wonderful!
 I even told a friend to take a look at Linux, but he's not too interested, even after I showed him that it's a really cool system. However, I understand him, no one likes change if they feel comfortable.
 I really think that there is almost no effort (even Arch, which I installed , people said it might be quite difficult for a first Linux, but I really don't feel it)!
 I wanted to write my story and say Hello to the great community, I'm glad I found myself here! Greets!

I posted it to the wrong subreddit not realizing the build problem is not a vscode problem. I am sorry it is so long but I tried to include as much as possible. Please let me know if I need to clarify anything.
 Also I am brand new to csharp so please be gentle and I would appreciate explaining more than you think you need to. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've coded for a programmable clock on a 4 digit 7 segment display that is connected to a PIC16F887. It is supposed to work as a clock and has 4 buttons that do the following: Enter programming mode, move digits, increase digit number, decrease digit number.
 It seems to simulate alright in Proteus, working like a clock, however it stops simulating at 1:52. Any idea if this might be because of the simulating platform? Or is the error within my code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. It’s just a random thought, but why attack somebody like Sony for client info when you could attempt to breach an ISP? Wouldn’t they hold more information that could be sensitive? I’m sure it would open a whole different can of worms in terms of internet security though. I’d imagine an ISP has different security conventions as opposed to any other randomly picked company.
 I just feel like if a malicious party really wanted to do damage, they wouldn’t focus on companies like Sony or whatever. I mean you gotta know once you’ve gone that far there’s no going back, and if you get caught it’s likely life in prison. So go for broke?
 Has this been done before? Why do you think cyber criminals focus on other businesses instead of ISP’s? Just curious is all. Always kinda wondered how secure an ISP was anyways, considering companies like Apple use services like Private Relay now. Is there a need for better security on the ISP’s end? Like, we have numerous methods to protect ourselves on our end, but what if we got attacked from that side as opposed to a leak of passwords, etc. from a random site?

 I have 3 years of experience working web dev part time during school and 2 summer internships. Plus my 6 months of post grad experience. I had that job about 6 months before the layoff. I've been out of work for 8 months. 
 I've gotten tons of rejections and a few interviews here since, with one almost leading to an offer. I have 2 more coming up, one due to networking. 
 I've read it takes on average 6-12 months for new grads to land a job. Still doesn't feel great. I know the market is bad. Still doesn't help my mental health. Maybe my resume sucks even though I've had it reviewed and improved a couple times. Have a look if you want https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/s/32Nq1Di8i9 . 
 Should I quit and wait? Accept I'll be one of those people who doesn't get a job in my field? Or am I being a dramatic doomer? Is this normal for recent grads?

Where would YOU start to become a full stack programmer? (Besides college obviously)
 
Do you think people without degrees in the field are still software engineers? -I say this because I see a lot of hate amongst people who did self-learning/ bootcamp over college. 
 
 Thank you. 
 . Also looking for a mentor, if anyone has experience or time on their hands. (10-15 min a day & we can either text or voice chat!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm developing some complex interconnected applications in Go (both mobile and desktop) and plan to use MQTT or NATS as underlying connectivity framework. Scaling is not a top priority , a single central server running on a VPS should suffice for the volume of messages. However, I have some general questions:
  
Would you recommend MQTT or NATS, or something else?
 I'm leaning towards NATS. If I choose it, would you recommend embedding the NATS server into Go, perhaps with central services built into the source, or does running the NATS CLI server have advantages?
 If you used MQTT or NATS before, do you have any general advice / caveats for starting a project? Things you wish you knew earlier when you used these frameworks?
 Are there any other technologies you would recommend for connecting software? I'm looking for data exchange between paired devices (mobile/desktop/server DB) and groups of users.
  
Sorry for asking such vague questions. Basically, I'm looking for feedback and experiences that might allow me to avoid errors or technical debt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I encountered an unexpected issue where Java virtual threads seemed slower than platform threads while working on my team application service.
 Virtual threads are designed to improve efficiency by avoiding blocking during I/O operations, but the performance tests showed slower response times with virtual threads.
 The issue was traced to the "pinning" where virtual threads get stuck on platform threads due to synchronized blocks, native methods, or foreign functions.

 There is a particular youtube video I follow along each time, which instructs how to not use admin by default,, use ssh keys, enable updates automatically as well enabling ufw. 
 I was wondering is there a follow along guide that you guys use here, any other tips would be appreciated
 I understand it's impossible to make a server bulletproof but the goal here is to not be an easy target.
 Edit: Just wanted to elaborate on something since me mentioning chatgpt has struck a nerve. Im not asking chatgpt for guidance but rather for linux commands, just like I sometimes use it for coding snippets for my projects. I'm pretty sure everyone is guilty of this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My dynamic allocation system involves sorting the various objects by type into segments big enough to fit the same number of them no matter the type's size. Trouble is, C is type-agnostic. I've heard that magic numbers may be used, along with checking members' types, but the fix with that is that two distinct types may have identical member lists, order, sizes, and all. Could the methods the type is involved in give the system a clue?

 I just wanna share this somewhere, and Mastodon/Bluesky have a character limit.
 My choice to use Linux is simple, based on three things:
  
On startup and idle, Windows runs my fans. Fedora spins them for five seconds while installing several large packages at once. So that's hardware longevity.
 
I don't own my filetypes on Windows: it is a ’Microsoft Edge XML Document‘ or a ’Mozilla Firefox PDF Document‘: not an eXtensible Markup or a Portable Document. That software does NOT own these open filetypes and should *not* claim to do so. The Cross Desktop Group has handled MIME and configuration better than the mess of the Windows Registry ever could.
 
Hardware compatibility: it's a stereotype that Windows ’just works‘. But we see countless examples of garbage systems that ’get fuck…]]></summary>

However, trying Debian now, but encountering what I think is the same issue. Trying to install Debian but running into "Unable to install grub in dummy" situation. Have tried various "solutions" in this subreddit and from other sources, but none seem to work. Here's where I am at now: 1. My current partitioning is a /boot, a root, swap, and a /home. 2. From what I can tell in this image, and correct me if I am wrong, but grub is trying to be installed into nvme0n1p1, which is the EFI partition created by Windows. 
 If there's any way to fix this, or any way to fix the initial grub-dummy installation error, please let me know. Anything is greatly appreciated.

 But I find that the moment I dive deeper into it, i am lost. I realise I want to go this direction, but I don't know shit. At the end of it all, I'm a HW engineer. I don't know REST APIs, dealing with JSON files, creating data pipelines, setting up frontend and backend servers. 
 It's like I can define the problem statement well and identify pain points in the day to day lives of fellow engineers, I can envision the solution but can't implement it. 
 How do I proceed further?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[int evaluateFullExpression(const std::vector<int>& numbers, const std::vector<char>& symbols, const std::vector<int>& symbolEvaluationOrder) { return 42; } 
 For the coding problem I am working on, I will have to perform the evaluateFullExpression(...) function many times, so I want to implement it in an optimized way. To explain the arguments, this is a math expression consisting of integers and the operators +, -, and *. So if numbers = { 2, 4, 7 } and symbols = { -, * } then that means the expression is 2 - 4 * 7.
 However, we are not evaluating the expression with normal order of operations. Instead, symbolEvaluationOrder provides the order to evaluate the operators in, so if symbolEvaluationOrder = { 0, 1 } then that means the expression must be evaluated as (2 - 4) * 7 = -14 while if symbolEvaluationOrder = { 1, 0 } then the expression is evaluated as 2 - (4 * 7) = -26.
 With three integers this is easy. But I must be able to do this for up to 100 integers and many times in a row. Can you help me figure out an optimized way to solve this?

 Long story shortened a bit, I have a Samsung tablet that I inherited which I have reason to believe was a retail display model. The model number is SM-T900, for reference. I have been trying to figure out how to connect it to my PC as a drawing tablet to use with Blender, but none of the apps that I've found so far that allow this are supported by the tablet. I found this questionable, as it seems like a pretty decent tablet that should be able to do it; my question is, is there hidden functionality in Samsung's display models that I can somehow unlock, or is this one simply not capable as a drawing tablet? Any information that could help would be greatly appreciated.

 I wanted to start doing monogame projects as fun way to practice my programming. After seeing how code is done in the real world from my internship, doing some small exercises from the C# player's guide and thinking about how I would structure my first (small) game project I realized I have no idea how I would structure even a small project.
 I know there is no right answer and it involves a lot of nuance and abstract thinking but as the question above says, how do I decide on when a csproj needs to be split up? how do I decide from the get go what functionality can be grouped into an existing project or if I need to create a new project for it? How do I know if im being too granular and splitting things into too many projects. 
 I realize this a design pattern type question but I havent gotten that far yet in my course work and would appreciate some guidance in the right direction. Whether you can explain it here, know some great websites or know some great content creators that would help to answer my question, it would be wonderful to hear your thoughts!

 Look at each entry ("sub-link"). Not that detailed, right?
 I find all MS Docs are kinda like this. Is that on purpose?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am learning c++ and I got to the point where I also need to understand other peoples code and the logic behind them.
 As I was looking at Arduino libraries, I saw plenty of enum classes, enums and #define's.
 So I wanted to use them in a project of mine to properly learn their usage but I am sooo confused. All the concepts have over-lapping usage cases so as I was writing the code for my project, I constantly asked myself: Wait a minute, am I doing something wrong?
 I think it will be easier if we look at this from a real life example.
 For example, I wrote a Blackjack bot and had a Deck class as mother class (GameDeck and PlayerDeck are derived from this class) and just used a typedef unsigned short int card_t for cards. You may have guessed, that's a poor decision and just amateurish in general.
 So I thought of something like this:
 enum CardSuit {SPADES,HEARTS,DIAMONDS,CLUBS}; enum CardType {TWO=2,THREE,FOUR,FIVE,SIX,SEVEN,EIGHT,NINE,TEN,K=10,J=10,Q=10,A=11}; struct Card { CardType cardType; CardSuit cardSuit; Card(CardSuit cardSuitParam, CardType cardTypeParam) { this->cardType = cardTypeParam; this->cardSuit = cardSuitParam; } }; 
 But... can't I just do this with typedef and define?
 Ugh, so confused. 
 How can I implement a card idea professionally fellow c++hads?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[4 years ago when I was starting make games in unity I made the mistake of tremendously underestimating the learning process, mainly programming. I've gone through the all the greatest hits, 2 hour video on C#, 27 part how to make an RPG playlist, learn 2d/3d game development in unity/unreal Udemy courses, Thomas brush and the beloved curtain close, blanking out when opening a new project after finishing the 27 part how to playlist.
 Again this went on for this entire time until last year that I started to feel like something was wrong if it wasn't already apparent, and so I've been changing my approach lately to actually develop those coveted problem solving skills and stuff but I'm still having a hard time. Lately I've seen a huge rise in "How to escape tutorial hell videos" and while at first it made me feel better by helping me identify the situation I was in, after seen like 10+ videos I've gotten on my recommended over time to see what other tips people might have , they all pretty much say the same thing which is mostly "just stop an make something yourself" or how to "watch tutorials effectively", which seems a bit unfair when you're still at square 1 not knowing what you don't know you need to learn.
 So as said in the title, what does it mean to leave tutorial hell?
 Is it to never gaze your eyes upon a piece of gamedev content and just sit down, open unity and visual studio and pull out Eric Legyen's Foundations of game engine development volume 1 out my butt?
 Or is it to plan out the 27 part how to make an RPG playlist by myself and just look up things as I encounter them like "okay so I need to move the player character in 4 directions" or "hmm.. I wonder how I can subtract health using a sort of trigger?"and then look it up learning those pieces of information bit by bit as you need them?
 Sorry for the long rant, I've been holding this in for a while now, thanks a lot if you took the time to read and respond.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I stumbled over this warning message while tinkering with placement new in a larger project. To give a small outline of the scope: The goal was to create an error system in an embedded project with -fno-exception and avoiding expensive heap allocations. This is where the placement-new operator comes into play, because it allows creating abstracted error objects. Errors are global and stateful (hence the abstraction) and require a central user-defined location where these are stored. This requirement should be enforced at compile time.
 To find a solution I thought of enforcing a user-defined storage object using an extern declaration, which would throw a linker error if missing. But during testing I noticed that I instead got the compile warning (turned to an error via -Werror) from the title. The setup for that is very specific and also only works with non-zero optimization (-Og or -O1-3) 
 So this got me wondering if there is any way to detect a missing storage location at compile time except linker warnings, so that I can provide a custom error message, because this pointer is null doesnt really tell the user anything, whereas undefined reference to storage does.
 I tried to narrow down the error and got the following code. Every line marked with // - was necessary to optimize for that warning.
 // compiled with g++ -c -O1 test.cpp #include <cstdint> #include <cstdio> #include <new> union Storage; static // - Storage *_StoragePtr; inline // - void setStorage(Storage *s) { _StoragePtr = s; } struct Error { virtual // - int foo() { return 1; } }; extern union Storage { Storage() { setStorage(this); } Error data; // example } storage; // user defined storage object // Storage storage; // - int main() { Error *error = new (_StoragePtr) Error(); printf("%i", error->foo()); // - auto stuff = error->foo(); // - }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, all, new user here. I'm trying to teach myself Cpp and I'm reading "C++ Primer" 5th Edition, and doing the exercises, and I just did exercise 1.4 where I converted an "add two integers" program into a "multiply two integers" program. I made the revisions, and built it without error, and ran it without error, at least on a variety of integers up to 4 digits long.
 But when I put in two larger integers (specifically, 56,789 and 67,890) the program ran and gave an answer that was not only the wrong number, but also was wrong in that it was negative (see screenshot below).
 https://i.ibb.co/648LVB5/Screenshot-20240615-140505.jpg
 Can anyone tell me why this happened? Could it be because the memory reserved for the calculation was not large enough for a product that had 10 digits?
 Also, I'm curious why I got a return value of 0 when there was clearly an error in the calculation somewhere.
 Finally, can anyone offer any advice on how to run down errors like this on my own without bugging redditors? Is there a facility within the Code::Blocks IDE that might help, for example?
 Thank you in advance for any help.

 I am working a Python + Cuda C++ backend for a functional programming language called Spiral and I am the process of enhancing it so it supports recursive discriminated union types and closures that are to be managed using reference counting via shared pointers. The closures are already done, but I am stuck on compiling recursive union types, so I need some help on how to do it.
 The way the question is going, I get the sense it is just going to be ignored, but I'd really want the language to support heap allocated recursive union types (like the ones F# has) in the Cuda backend, so I am reposting it here for visibility.
 Edit: It got resolved and it turns out it is a weird NVRTC related issue. The code with some modificication does compile with NVCC. I opened a bug report on the Nvidia dev support page and I'll see how it'll turn out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, i'm playing with pipes, especially NamedPipe Client/Server. And i notice one thing - if client pipe contains StreamReader and some logic like this:
 while ((line = sr.ReadLine()) != null) { Console.WriteLine(line); } 
 seems like sr.ReadLine() is blocking thread, if ServerPipe doesn't write anything and just sitting in Thread.Sleep().
 I am curious - is it an actual feature, and where i can read more about such behaviour, because msdn has pretty poor information about pipes. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I have just entered my 40s and am an average-skilled software developer.
 In the past, I have some experience in developing CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitLab, and now I am currently working as a React/Java developer. Recently, I received an offer to work as a DevOps engineer at a large corporation that heavily uses Jenkins.
 The reason they are hiring me, someone with a mixed career of development and CI/CD experience, instead of a DevOps expert, is probably because their Groovy scripts have become very large and complex, necessitating a dedicated software engineer to refactor/manage them. My main responsibilities would be developing and maintaining Jenkins pipelines for on-prem legacy systems, which would account for about 60-70% of my work, with the remainder involving DevOps tool development using Python and shell scripts, and cloud infra automation tasks as some of their services are running on the cloud. I feel that if I stay here for 3-4 years, I might find it difficult to come back to a developer or work on anything other than managing legacy Jenkins tasks, yet the salary is 30% higher than my current one, which makes the decision challenging. TBH, I don't have extensive experience in managing Jenkins, so I'm not sure if the job is going to be terrible or surprisingly manageable..
 Would you take a 30% salary increase to manage legacy Jenkins systems? What would you do in my situation? If I manage to become a Jenkins expert with moderate experience in infrastructure automation through tools like Terraform or Ansible, would that make me still competitive in the market as a DevOps professional?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I'm excited to have just release my first crate, transient. This crate provides an alternate implementation of the the std::any::Any dynamic typing mechanism that includes the support for non-'statictypes that is missing from the stdlib's version.
 repo - https://github.com/JRRudy1/transient
 docs - https://docs.rs/transient/0.1.1/transient
 To use this crate you implement the simple Transient trait for a type (derive macro included) which captures its transient behavior (i.e. lifetimes and variance), after which you can cast to the reimplemented dyn Any trait object and later downcast to the original concrete type. Implementing this trait is unsafe but straight-forward, and once implemented everything else is safely enforced using the type system.
 Notable features:
  
Fully replicates the std::any module
 Near-identical API for 'static types with small changes for transient types
 Supports any number of generic type/lifetime/const parameters
 No external dependencies without feature-gates
 Includes a (feature-gated) derive macro for the Transient trait
 ProvidesTransient impls for many stdlib types
 Provides (feature-gated) Transient impls for some foreign types - feel free to request more!
 Extensive documentation including numerous examples
 Permissive MIT/APACHE-2.0 dual license
  
I decided to make this crate after running into the 'static-only limitation of the stdlib version on multiple occasions, such as when I wanted to erase the type of an ndarray::ArrayView<'v, T, D> to pass it through generic-forbidding code and ended up having to clone the data instead. If you have ever faced a situation like this (which I'll admit is fairly niche), then this is the crate for you!
 Let me know what you think! Suggestions for improvement, constructive criticism, and feature requests are very welcome

 AMD Linux engineer Mario Limonciello explained in the patch: 
  
"A Rembrandt-based HP thin client is reported to have problems where the NVME disk isn't present after resume from s2idle. 
  
This is because the NVME disk wasn't put into D3 at suspend, and that happened because the StorageD3Enable _DSD was missing in the BIOS. 
 As AMD's architecture requires that the NVME is in D3 for s2idle, adjust the criteria for force_storage_d3 to match *all* Zen SoCs when the FADT advertises low power idle support. 
 This will ensure that any future products with this BIOS deficiency don't need to be added to the allow list of overrides."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 
 For the last six months or so, I have been teaching myself programming pretty much from zero. I've never been to any class, followed a textbook, or contributed to any open source projects before. Most of what I've learned, I've learned straight from documentation I've found online, and trial/error. 
 I wrote a function to organise a bunch of system calls for a personal project. When I was done, i looked back at what I had written, and how i styled/formatted it to be more readable and clear (to my own eye) what it was doing, and how it worked, but it occurred to me that if I showed my code to anyone with any amount of formal training, i might be absolutely disgusted with what they saw. 
 While this IS a personal project, and I dont intend on another living soul ever having to work with this code, I would like to know if this is considered 'bad practice' or a habit i should try and break if i ever want to write C++ professionally. Moreover, I'm very curious as to what someone familiar with C++ would actually think!

 Sorry for not using the 'code block' feature to post this, I tried using it and it made it difficult to see how this was formatted.

 Ive been staring at this for a while and I have no clue why it says that "Index is outside the bounds of the array"
 problem is in the "if (BoardValues[inputConvertedToInt] == '-') validSpot = true;" line
 the array BoardValues should be a 9 value char array and If i input 5 (or anything else) it says it is out of bounds.
 I am inputing a char so I convert it to integer (dont know if that is needed) and subtract one so it matches the positions 0-8. Then i want to check if that spot on the array is '-' , if it is, the bool is true.
 If i replace the "inputConvertedToInt" with any number to test it, it works.
 I would like to know what I did wrong or at least point me in the direction.
 Thank you.
 class Board {
 bool validSpot; public char[] BoardValues = [ '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-' ]; public void DisplayBoard() { Console.WriteLine($" {BoardValues[6]} | {BoardValues[7]} | {BoardValues[8]} "); Console.WriteLine("---+---+---"); Console.WriteLine($" {BoardValues[3]} | {BoardValues[4]} | {BoardValues[5]} "); Console.WriteLine("---+---+---"); Console.WriteLine($" {BoardValues[0]} | {BoardValues[1]} | {BoardValues[2]} "); } public bool CheckIfEmpty(char input) { bool validSpot; int inputConvertedToInt = Convert.ToInt32(input)-1; if (BoardValues[inputConvertedToInt] == '-') validSpot = true; else validSpot = false; return validSpot; } public void InsertPlayerInput(char symbol ,char input) { if (validSpot) { switch (input) { case '1': BoardValues[0] = symbol; break; case '2': BoardValues[1] = symbol; break; case '3': BoardValues[2] = symbol; break; case '4': BoardValues[3] = symbol; break; case '5': BoardValues[4] = symbol; break; case '6': BoardValues[5] = symbol; break; case '7': BoardValues[6] = symbol; break; case '8': BoardValues[7] = symbol; break; case '9': BoardValues[8] = symbol; break; } } else Console.WriteLine("This is not a valid spot"); }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a library for deferred formatting in C. The library was inspired by this rust based deferred formatting library defmt.
 Hope it's okay to post here as this library has two halves, one in C and another in Rust.
 On the C side the library is a header-only library, that requires some modifications to the linker script, and only requires gnu c99 (or maybe even 89) (which is supported by most compilers).
 The C related part sits in cdefmt/include/cdefmt.h
 All of the log strings are being embedded into the resulting `.elf` file. which can be later stripped before being flashed to the device or running on the host.
 The resulting logs are very small, only the size of a pointer per log + whatever arguments were sent to the log.
 Once the device generates the logs, they can be parsed using a library I wrote in rust.
 Given the logs' binary stream and the original elf, the logs can be reconstructed and the parameter's types are inferred from the debugging information encoded in the elf.
 There's support for format hints, enum name lookup and more.
 Currently the code reached a minimum viable product status, there's quite a bit of cleanup and documentation to be done and some missing features to implement, however I thought now would be a good time to share the library and get some feedback.
 An example is provided and validated on a linux system.
 Small example of a log:
 typedef struct some_struct { uint64_t a; uint32_t b; uint16_t c; } some_struct_t; struct some_struct some_struct = { .a = 1234567890123456789, .b = 1234567890, .c = 12345, }; CDEFMT_INFO("some struct: {}", some_struct); 
 And the parsed log:
 Info > some struct: {a: 1234567890123456789, b: 1234567890, c: 12345} 
 TL;DR: I made a logging library that I think is pretty cool.

 In a nutshell, I have a main class that handles some incoming data. Once processed, the main class will call a method in one or more "child" classes. These child classes will require the processed data from the main class, as well as a varying range of other properties that the main class will contain. The thing is, not all of the child classes will always require the same set of parameters, other than the processed data.
 Below is a simple code outline of what I'm trying to achieve.
 The 2 possible solutions I've come up with so far, noted as Option 1 and Option 2 in the code example, are to just pass the main class to the child method, or use event handlers. Bearing in mind, obviously both options won't be in…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, dear C-language Reddit community, I have a question/discussion for you! 
 Deal is - I, myself a programmer, trying to teach the basics of programming and especially programming in C to my friend. who is not a programmer themselves. I understand C fairly well, but it's not my main language and C itself is not tied with my day-to-day responsibilities and tasks at work. I'm trying to collect insights and compose a learning plan to help them dive in and understand basics and more. To sum it up - I guess I need a pretty detailed roadmap. Also, I think it's important to provide a fair bit of practice. And I personally want this practice be as much interesting, interactive and maybe even fun to do. I know that there are resources as easy-level LeetCode and such, but to my personal preference - it's too early for them to try them out. Maybe you can convince me otherwise.
 I've learned that Reddit can be a great resource for such a deal, so here I am, writing this post.
 I'm truly eager to hear you all out and take part in the conversation. Thank's in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I understand the warning and why it's useful, I agree with what it's trying to prevent and I don't want to disable it. However, I'm running into issues with it that I don't know how to handle. Consider this code :
  internal class Foo { private FooObject currentObject; public FooObject CurrentObject { get => currentObject; private set { currentObject = value; } } public Foo() { CurrentObject = new FooObject(); } } 
 This code gives the "warning CS8618: Non-nullable field 'currentObject' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor. Consider declaring the field as nullable."
 As far as I understand though, currentObject is set through the CurrentObject setter (Setter kept simple for brevity, assume it needs to be custom to do some other stuff).
 Now my question is, is the warning valid for some reason that is escaping me? If not, how would I go around making it go away without disabling the warning entirely? (and without just marking the field as nullable)

(I haven't done a project yet, so I wanna add at least some form of a project to my resume to start submitting applications for internships) I wanna create my own linked list so the performance for inserting and deleting is better than a linked list of a library. Would that be a valid? How would i measure the metrics between my own linked list and one that i used from a library in c++. I want to see if my metrics are slower in terms of time and memory complexity. Collect those metrics and put it on my resume in the xyz format, to make it look better. Any thoughts.

 So, I am a Computer Science Engineering BSc student and I studied C during my 1st Semester, so I learned most of the basic and syntax stuff, and I went through it again as I am doing the CS50x course. My question now is how should I progress and deep my knowledge that it will be possible to do some projects and something relevant, as I find myself always stuck on the basic level of every language and don't to further with developing projects
 My first idea is to practice data structures and algorithms using C and then maybe LeetCode a bit using C. But I want to work with AI later in my career so I searched a bit and apparently I can use C for Image Processing. Another idea, is to do Computer Graphics using OpenGL.
 So, what are you suggestion and what I can do in order to build some projects for a portfolio

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I've been studying DevOps for a long time now, and I'm excited to share that I've earned my (CKA) certification! My next goal is to obtain the AWS (SAA) certification to enhance my resume.
 I used to work as a core telecom engineer, but I realized that the field is quite niche. This led me to make the decision to transition to DevOps, a field I'm truly passionate about. I would wake up every day excited to study and learn more about it, and now, I'm thrilled to say that I'll be starting my new job in DevOps soon. I can't wait!
 Do you have any tips for someone just starting out in this field? I have a week-long vacation between the two jobs, and I want to use this time effectively to prepare and get ready for this new chapter.
 Thanks in advance for your advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a package 20-25 years old. There is a lot of crud in it. So newer compilers get more pedantic, gradually clean up code. I build this package in Manjaro with gcc 14.1.1 and it picked up 2 errors - long/int mismatch. Then tried Endeavor OS, same gcc 14.1.1 compiler. Both are spinoffs of Archlinux, so presumed compilers would be indentical. It found a lot more long/int mismatch errors, returns without a value, and functions without prototypes and the obsolete 'caddr_t' type. Both compilers seem to be defaulting to std=c17. Same source files and makefiles. So is there some secret environment variable or config file that is telling compiler to go full nitpicking mode? I don't object to fixing up the flaws, just curious why compiler behaves so differently.

 I've been a Cs student for 2 yrs now and I've recently realised that I barely know anything. I do decent on tests and exams but I'm not the best coder I also realised I can't answer basic questions on the subjects I learn cuz I tend to forget everything after an exam I'm pretty sure I can get better at my coding my practicing but getting myself to practice itself takes a lot even though I enjoy it because I've convinced myself that I'm too stupid to understand what I'm supposed to do. It's ironic cuz my fear of not knowing is stopping me from actually learning. I guess I just need advice cuz I've only recently realised how I just don't retain any of the information taught to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's an infinite loop: you crave making a game, you start developing something, you get bored or burnt out, you stop. I was really enjoying the process, I like making games and I like using Godot, but then yet again I stopped. This time I reflected a bit and I understood why it happened. Apparently I don't have a clear goal. I start to think about "why should I make this game, there are thousands better than mine". I make games since I was 14 (now I'm 32) and when I was younger it was very easy for me working consistently to a game, indeed I released several games. The simple "I just want to make a game because yes" worked at that time. Now it doesn't work anymore and the lack of a reason, something to achieve for having developed a game makes me lose the direction and the beauty of creating something. Does it happens to you too? Should I simply give up making games? (I can't, after some times I inevitably come back making games 🫤) Do you have any suggestion?

 I taught myself some coding like python and then Java (including website dev), but I struggle to learn things when the basics are beyond my scopes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three years ago, I joined my company as an iOS developer on a new project. At the start, we had a team of 8 people, including engineers, QA, a PM, and a manager. We are part of a medium-sized engineering department with 400 people.
 Everything was perfect when we started as a small team of 8 building the app. We produced high-quality code with very few bugs. Last year, my team doubled in size to 15 people. Now, we are more prone to bugs and errors, partly due to the hiring of some inexperienced developers.
 Earlier this year, we launched the app and it was a great success. The engineering department now thinks it’s a good idea to integrate React and backend engineers into our team for a "learning" experience. However, these inexperienced developers are committing atrocious code. It only slows us down and increases the number of bugs. Just today, I was browsing our app and landed on a page I worked on a month ago. The page has become unusable because a React developer "worked" on it, introducing numerous anti-patterns.
 I'm not even sure what we are working on anymore. I keep finding pages and features that we weren't made aware of.
 You might argue that our PR process should improve, but it’s impossible to review every PR when 7 other teams are committing their code to the mobile codebase. I now spend most of my time either reviewing PRs or helping someone learn Swift.
 How much of a red flag is this? Will non-iOS developers completely burn the project to the ground?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm wondering about graphics. My understanding of how they work is that shaders run on the gpu, that output is used somehow to create ✨graphics✨; and I know that opengl, vulkan, etc can help with that. I would think that wgpu would be similar.
  
wgpu is a safe and portable graphics library for Rust based on the WebGPU API. It is suitable for general purpose graphics and compute on the GPU.
 Applications using wgpu run natively on Vulkan, Metal, DirectX 12, and OpenGL ES; and browsers via WebAssembly on WebGPU and WebGL2.
  
but this (the description from wgpu homepage) is tripping me up. if wgpu serves the same purpose as opengl and vulkan, what does it mean for it to "run" on one of those? based on that description, presumably wgpu is more generic than opengl or vulkan, but if so, what can it actually do? and if one is trying to make an application that has graphics, would one only need wgpu? or would they need other stuff?
 furthermore, what do these libraries provide beyond just shaders? do they somehow make it easier to use them? if graphics are on the gpu, then why is there a non-shader interface at all? what does that provide?

 I kind of assume that you already have some level of programming experience and want to branch into hacking - if you don't then I'd recommend getting the hang of a programming language like C++ first. You can find plenty of help with that elsewhere, so that's not a focus of this post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is all just for learning , but I wonder whats the perspective of actual developers working on company code.
 How do you approach something like Fuzz testing in C?
 Here is my use case.
 I have a extremely simple TAX calculator, that takes an ammount of money and input and provides an output.
 The format of the ammount I want to enforce is something like
 230.21
 30221.49
 3.42
 Some amount of $ capped at some arbitrary amount and no more than 2 decimal places.
 I would like to filter out things like any other characters that are not numbers or '.' And I believe I did it! but how do I know is bulletproof?
 So in my mind I think I could write something like "Unit Testing" and provide like a lot of inputs and check if the return is satisfactory.
 Are there any well known testing tools you use on a professional setting?
 Or is the creation of this teoretical software testing code left out to a Software testing engineer?
 Thanks!

 My family member was on holiday a few weeks ago and made a purchase in a local shop to where he was staying. He paid with his debit card and left. And he’s now saying that there’s been £3-5 taken out each day since, and £100 that was blocked by the bank. Surely this isn’t possible? Google didn’t come up with much no matter how I phrased it, just gave results for online stores.
 I have reasons to be suspicious about his spending, so just wondering if it’s another cover up.
 Edit: this was the UK, no credit card, paid with contactless. We don’t use swipe cards here.

 I'm studying a post-Graduate Diploma in Computer Science (with no previous IT background). We're using C# in our Object Oriented Programming course. I did outstanding in my first two subjects, but I'm having major issues with the programming subjects and C#. It SEEMS like I can never find or recognise a solution in my notes from class, and have to end up Googling answers, which is really slow going...
 Just one question for now: is there an easy way to write C# code that will check to see if a 3 digit code entered by a user contains: an upper case letter, followed by a two digit number?
 I've discovered there are methods called Char.IsUpper() and Char.IsNumber() but I'm still trying to understand how to use these....and whether or not they're the right choice at all. 
 No fancy or advanced solutions would be allowed. It's only very early on in my course.
 Thanks for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am CS grad student. I had my graduation ceremony last week. The following Monday I got an email from the startup that I was interviewing for that I have been selected for an internship. Even though I am looking for full-time I was a relieved a bit because I can have some more time to find fill time or even convert the above internship into full time since they did mention about the possibility of converting. I was getting responses from the CEO for my queries about the compensation, joining date, etc('will get back to you soon about it') but now he seems to have ghosted.
 Until now I have given 3 interviews including a FAANG only to get rejected in the final rounds. All my friends have a job they are moving away while I'm the only one left.
 I don't know what is wrong. The last company said I had many strong qualities but a few that they were looking for is missing. As an international student I only have two months i.e till August and I am worried a lot. 
 I have been working so hard, day and night not being able to sleep so that I can give my all for the assignments and interviews only to be rejected.
 It hurts like hell and I feel so lost. Every time I don't get an offer letter after the final round I feel that I have lost everything and now I have to start from scratch. It is physically and mentally exhausting.
 Not only that but it hurts to see my parents work hard to provide me the money to stay here. I can't do it anymore. I don't know how to survive this. How do I survive this?

On my 4th rejection from first round interviews and definitely start to feel a bit depressed and the feeling that I'm just not good enough. Probably me being naïve in thinking it shouldn't be that hard coming from a Sr. SRE role, but now understanding my skills not reflecting my senior role as much. I been more an ops guy that was put in a SRE role due to company acquisition and I think I've performed okay, Although probably not enough exp in design systems and coding as I'd like. 
 I been trying to apply for more the roles I'd like such as devops/system engineer. More roles regarding ops deployment/monitoring infra and some fun in automation. But these interviews have been killer. I can't really tell if I did good or not and so far haven't been able to get pass each tech phone screen or 1st round interview. I guess I'm more here to rant since it's hard to talk to anybody else about this.. I'm still trying to keep my head up high, as I put my head into books such as "The SRE Workbook", " Designing Data-Intensive Applications", "Understanding Distributed Systems", reviewing my linux/networking basics and trying to do some leet coding. 
 Feels like I'm up against the Google and meta senior eng when applying, although I would never know since the companies I've applied for are not willing to share feedback. Or it could be my bad memory, feeling like these interviews are just like college exams and all about memorization.

But, staying creative gets exhausting. I feel like the effort isn't appreciated, and they wish my teams would speed up and pump out more, even if it's built on a house of cards.
 That seems to …]]></summary>

 I'd say 90% of what we do is in the code. Even today I had to set up some standalone box with a basic Flask app, communicating with RDS and that will be discarded after a week my manager wanted it committed to repo. Same with some cost report for a single account for a dev team.
 We also have internal tools to manage the infrastructure and applications - need to create users in some app? No, you're not gonna do it by hand, write a Python function. 
 I'm not complaining, just want to know if this is common and if I moved somewhere else the practices and approach would be similar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope you're all doing well. I just wrote my first C++ program, and I'm completely new to programming. I'm currently in my last year of high school. I'm from a place where programming isn't given much attention, but I really enjoy it. I'm pretty good at math and physics, and I love problem-solving. However, I'm a bit lost on where to go from here.
 My question to you all is: How can I make money in the future? I understand that programming offers various paths, but I'm not sure where to start or what to focus on. Should I get into C++ and master it? Are there other programming languages or skills I should focus more on? Are there remote or freelance opportunities I could pursue in the future? Like I said, I'm from a place where they don't care much about stuff like that. I think it's called a third-world country or something. so that's why i don't know much about it
 I'm thankful to any of you who are willing to help me decide what to do. I'm fully aware that it takes time, and I'm pretty confident in my skills.
 i choose c++ as a challenge and well i wrote that without any problem.
 Best regards
 i don't think this is the best place to ask such a question but well. 
 this is the code i wrote it right after outputting hello world

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I lack the C# fluency to describe what I want in idiomatic terms - my goal is to make a type, basically:
 struct Token { byte[] data = new byte[8]; //... } 
 Whatever implementation I end up with, there will be 64 bits of data. I'm perfectly happy with using a uint64, but the data will always be initialized with an ASCII character string 8 characters or less.
 For which there will be mostly constants, some runtime variables:
 static readonly Token foo {/* ... */}; static readonly Token bar {/* ... */}; static readonly Token baz {/* ... */}; 
 Or const, again, my C# isn't strong...
 That will work in a switch statement:
 var t = get(); switch(t) { case foo: /* ... */ break; case bar: /* ... */ break; case baz: /* ... */ break; default: /* ... */ break; } 
 If this were C++, I could make this work in an instant. I have a sense that C# ought to be robust enough to allow me to express the same.
 I've taken a couple swings at this, trying to quell the compiler, trying to leverage implicit cast operator overloads... I'm missing something, if it's even possible.
 Is it possible? What verbage do I need to know to google? Or would someone demonstrate?
 If you're curious about some of the constraints, these tokens are memory mapped.

 As I top off at the more senior end of the IC scale, I am invited and expected to sit in on lower value meetings to “gain context”. Although the context is useful (especially in very large/multiple work streams), I usually start finishing tasks in parallel. 
 This happens especially as a remote worker.
 I realize this context switching can lead to burnout and unnecessary mental fatigue.
 The obvious solution is to “just stop it” or block off time on my calendar, but that’s not always possible being responsible on high visibility / high impact / multiple projects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It would be really helpful if someone can give me advice considering my situations. I'll be graduating by this year with a CS degree but I still know nothing about coding.
 I wasn't a good student from the beginning and in the second year I had a mental breakdown after facing so much failure in life and because of that I had a huge drop in the cgpa. I was living alone in the hostel and could't even share anything with my parents. But when I gave up on everything I finally decided to quit my life and finally show my grades to parents before that. It was one of the hardest decisions of my life, and when I showed my grades to my parents I saw my father cry for the first time in life. At that moment, I forgot everything and promised myself I'd become a better student and resettle the things I've done bad.
 Fast forward to 2024, I did become a good student, my grades came up, took studying seriously and gave the exams seriously. But as you all know uni teaching doesn't make you a better programmer so I am still not so much skillful to get a job.
 So, anyone reading this I'd really be so much blessed if you can show me or advice me a lerning path. My goal is to now restart the coding learning from basics, I am considering to start with CS50. Will that be a better choice? I want to learn the basics and master DSA in these few months and trynna enter Leetcode. Would this be a better approach or if you think there is faults in my plan. (Also I am very weak in math, if you guys have any good resources that gives enough knowledge of math needed for a coder...please provide it)

 Today I meet a weird issue when using C++20 concept. I plan to make a reference template which only allows user to pass a class derived from an 'Object' class. So I made:
 class Object; template <typename T> concept DerivedFromObject = std::is_base_of_v<Object, T>; class Object { ... }; template <typename T> requires DerivedFromObject<T> class ref { ... }; 
 However, I found I cannot use it if for some kinds of class which contains methods like:
 class Resource : public Object { public: static ref<Resource> load(std::string path); }; 
 It reports an error:
 An undefined class is not allowed as an argument to compiler intrinsic type trait '__is_base_of' 
 It means at the moment of a member method is declared; class Resource is not complete. So that I cannot use is_base_of to check it. Do you have any idea of how to solve an issue like that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At my job we're currently developing an API, with a ClientLib for the API in a NuGet package. But now we've had a bit of a discussion, how to define the DTO classes in the Client. We've come up with 4 possible solutions:
 1. Define the classes in both the API and the ClientLib
 Duplicate code (not per se a bad thing), but there is more room for error. Fixing a bug in the API DTO and forgetting to change the library or something like that.
 2. Define the classes in the ClientLib, and let the API include the ClientLib
 This would remove the duplicity, but feels wrong. The client should not be the owner of the DTO's, but the API. 
 3. Define the classes in the API and include the API in the ClientLib
 Would make the whole ClientLib bloated with code it doesn't need.
 4. Create a seperate Library with the DTO's, which get included in both the API and the ClientLib
 Feels like a lot of extra complexity for such a small problem.
 Currently we've gone with Number 1. Sure some duplicate code, but it's a total seperation of concerns. And each DTO can have some utility functions specifically for the API or Client.
 I guess I'm not the only one working with API and Clients this way, so really interested in how others solve this "problem".

 I needed to make data validation because the user is working with sensitive data and if they put bad data it can screw up our operations. 
 For me I just added a cell validation event through designer for data grid view. After making the event with a bit of research, I’m a bit confused still. 
 QUESTION: 
 How do events, namely DataGridView.CellValidating event work? 
 “Occurs when a cell loses input focus, enabling content validation.”
 So how does the program know the cell is losing focus behind the scenes? 
 And what is “object sender” VS. “DataGridViewCellValidatingEventArgs e”
 Because it seems e represents a cell? Or perhaps the event of leaving the cell? I dunno…

 Updating navigation and managing state between pages.
 Best practices or potential pitfalls to avoid during this transition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This problem is very specific and might need some details about my project. There's a boolean variable quit inside engine class that is initialised to be false inside engine.h file. 
 The engine.h file includes UI.h and Window.h files to initialise, update and close window and UI. Inside the running function inside engine.h there's a running function that has
 while(!quit){ UI.update(); Window.update(); .... }
 Inside the UI's update function I want the ability to somehow change the quit to true and close stop the programme. This is because I want to be able to make a custom quit button for my application. 
 What I have tried: Making a setter function for quit inside engine and trying to use it from UI's update function. But it doesn't work because I can't take or give engine as a parameter to my UI class because engine uses UI. 
 What can I do? Should I change the structure of my project or am I just too dumb for not seeing any potential easy and simple solution? Any help is appreciated thank you.
 I didn't want to say it but please spare me for asking such questions actually I am a self taught student and I am not fond of reading big books about a language or watch multiple videos about a language. I started making small projects and learning on the way.... This is the first problem that I faced and didn't find solution in the internet. As I said any help is appreciated or any links to resources that can help solve problem or mentioning any better place to ask this question will make me very grateful.

 int heroHealth = 10; int monsterHealth = 10; Random random = new Random(); while (heroHealth !<= 0 ^ monsterHealth !<= 0) { int monsterHealthLost = random.Next(1,10); Console.WriteLine($"Monster was damaged and lost {monsterHealthLost} health and now has {(monsterHealth - monsterHealthLost).ToString()}."); monsterHealth -= monsterHealthLost; int heroHealthLost = random.Next(1, 10); Console.WriteLine($"Hero was damaged and lost {heroHealthLost} health and now has {(heroHealth - heroHealthLost).ToString()}."); heroHealth -= heroHealthLost; } if (heroHealth < monsterHealth) { Console.WriteLine("Monster Wins!"); } else if (heroHealth > monsterHealth) { Console.WriteLine("Hero Wins!"); }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put down your phones when you are talking to people. Unless you are ONLY with other interns, texting while talking with coworkers is EXTREMELY rude.
 I was introduced to an intern that will be on my team this summer. There were 4 of us talking and as soon as the conversation shifted to another person in the group, she was on her phone. It left a totally weird first impression. 
 And it is definitely not the first time I’ve seen this. I have had other interactions where I’m talking one on one with someone and they start texting. I just assume I am boring them and leave the convo. 
 Those who get return offers aren’t necessarily those who produce the most output, it is those who are able to communicate effectively and conduct themselves professionally in an office.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! We have this project that is a secondary initiative (we get about 10% we get about 10% of time to work on it) where they got together some people from different teams to form a group that would work on a new initiative. Right now, the team has about 10 people assigned to it. But between architects, 2 managers from different teams, a scrum master, two eng from a stakeholder team that are there in an advising role, and a staff eng that says is too busy to do technical work. We are literally 3 people working and 7 people watching.
 Obviously the project is going extremely slow, so some questions are being asked constantly about what are the blockers and how many hours are being dedicated to it.
 It is an interesting project on a hot topic that I want to get more experience on (you can easily guess the topic, although I won’t confirm it since I don’t want to give too much away). So I’m not interested on stepping away from it but at the same time the fact that 70% of the team is just watching is slowly getting to me
 Edit: my question is how to approach this to make it a successful project. Should we advocate to trade some of these people for working hands? Should we leave it as it is but set expectations that this will be slow?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are there any good tips for going this route? I have a LOT of experience figuring new or existing technologies out and designing a process to fit. I also understand data architecture, engineering and cloud dev ops (not really on prem). My biggest selling point is that I'll make it work and I'm confident I can do so even if I've never worked with the technology. My biggest weakness is needing to make decisions that should be made by the business arm but this is why contracting is so appealing to me. 
 I don't see a way into this without getting recruited off another job (which I stupidly turned down for another job offer) but if I don't ask I'll never know. 
 I'm even willing to get started on the side for low to no money. I'm bored and like the challenges of this work but hate the politics. If someone had a cool project that they wanted their data organized for self service analytics id probably do it for free.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in the UK
 my role has a 3 month probation
 recently, we had a meeting and they asked to extend my probation by 3 months
 the reasons were not over my work, but my ways of working
 team was helpfull in the beggining, but then it dried down,
 they left my pr's for 3 weeks which had me missing deadlines (they didnt mention anything about deadlines)
 avoid giving me help or confirm the logs so I can move to higher envs, and my manager wouldnt let me go higher until I had proof that everything is working
 I listed the logs, but no one had time to see them for 3 weeks, and I could move higher
 I was lied to many times that they will check and then they never did, also a few times they ended up telling me to check with my manager since they dont know what I am supposed to do.
 Keep in mind 90% of my prs were easy to understand what I am doing, and the other 10 I could explain in 5 minutes but nobody bothered
 now on the probation review, I was told that they dont check my prs because they feel like I dont listen to their advices,
 this happened 2 times, which meant I need to do the solution differently although I had it running and we also had same solutions like mine running. I run it with my manager and he said lets go with what is working.
 also a lot of other things
 the thing is that I dont like complaining, so I didnt mention nothing all this time
 but it looks like I should have
 in my probation review it was mentioned that I need to work on:
 documentation, cooperation and understanding the whole infrastructure better
 I accept most of the feedback ,but I dont feel it is worth extending my probation because I dont feel respected and I am thinking of applying to other jobs
 also, this reason can be generic and can be applied even if I improve so I feel they are trying to find someone else and then sack me
 any advice?
 am I wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to get people’s opinion on this. I have dealt with hands off managers who may still be technical. I have also dealt with hands on managers who jump in and write a lot of code themselves. I will say that in almost every case where managers are writing code it’s pretty much a disaster.
 Now there are cases where teams are tiny, only consisting of maybe 3 members and a lot of work. So managers may have no choice but to write code. In some startup situations it makes sense. But it should be looked at as temporary and not something permanent.
 I have found managers who write code tend to get requirements and not share them with the team. Building things in secret. Or they just don’t allow the team to do any interesting work, only leaving them scraps to work with. They can also just push their code across in code reviews because they are the boss. And even if they allow their code to be reviewed they can just ignore comments and bypass all the checks or coerce reviewers to approve their code anyway. Also they can just push their code across and it doesn’t have to be QA’ed.
 I have ran into this. Where our manager created a caching layer due to an optimization roadmap. We have no clue he had been working on this service. And it was kind of an agreement he had between himself and my VP. They both agreed he should work on it because they needed to get this deliver quickly and the normal process would be cumbersome. This was launched in prod. Disaster struck. Due to a threading issue customers were seeing other customer account info. This was a phased deployment so the impact was only 1% in a specific region. But this should have never made it to production at all.
 I have also found managers who code don’t develop good teams. Again they hog up all the interesting work. Refuse to share their knowledge or let anyone work on things they are working on. And it just feels toxic to me. 
 But what are you opinions? Any scenarios that may contradict my opinions?

The vast majority of people saying it does nothing, but when I look at their game, it legitimately looks worse than the flash games people were making when I was in middle school.
 This (image) is one of the top games on a top post right now (name removed) about someone saying NextFest has done nothing for them despite 500k impressions. This looks just awful. And it's not unique. 80%+ of the games I see linked in here look like that have absolutely 0 visual effort.
 You can't put out this level of quality and then complain about lack of interest. Indie devs get a bad rap because people are just churning out asset flips or low effort garbage like this and expecting people to pay money for it.

 Facets is a no-code Infra automation platform that helps you write terraform using a simple drag-and-drop interface. There's more to Facets but this should give you a gist of the platform.
 Over the past three years, we built one of the most comprehensive DevOps automation platforms out there. I say this not just because I'm part of the company but because I was the end user before becoming a founder.
 That helped me determine all the problems developers face first-hand so we could build them into the tool.

 I'm trying to integrate Tailwind CSS in my ASP.NET Core MVC 8 project. The initial build works fine, but the NPM script for building Tailwind CSS isn't triggered on subsequent changes, even with hot reload enabled. Here's my setup:
  
csproj file: ```xml <Target Name="NpmInstall" BeforeTargets="BuildCSS" Inputs="package.json" Outputs="$(NpmLastInstall)"> <Exec Command="npm install" /> <Touch Files="$(NpmLastInstall)" AlwaysCreate="true" /> </Target>
  
<Target Name="BuildCSS" BeforeTargets="Build"> <Exec Command="npm run buildcss:dev" Condition=" '$(Configuration)' == 'Debug' " /> <Exec Command="npm run buildcss:release" Condition=" '$(Configuration)' == 'Release' " /> </Target> ```
  
package.json: json { "scripts": { "buildcss:dev": "postcss ./wwwroot/css/input.css -o ./wwwroot/css/app.css", "buildcss:release": "npx tailwindcss --config tailwind.config.js --postcss postcss.config.js -i ./wwwroot/css/input.css -o ./wwwroot/css/app.css --minify", "watch": "npx tailwindcss --config tailwind.config.js --postcss postcss.config.js -i ./wwwroot/css/input.css -o ./wwwroot/css/app.css --watch" }, "devDependencies": { "autoprefixer": "^10.4.19", "postcss": "^8.4.38", "tailwindcss": "^3.4.4" } } 
  
3.tailwind.config.js: ```js /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} / module.exports = { content: ["./Views//.cshtml", "./Views/*.cshtml", "./wwwroot/css/input.css"], theme: { extend: { fontFamily: { inter: ["Inter"], } }, }, plugins: [], }
 ```
 After the first build, any new utility classes I add aren't being picked up and rebuilt. Even with hot reload enabled (Ctrl + S), the changes don't trigger a rebuild.
 What am I missing? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 So, I’ve been thrown into the deep end with a project that's practically ancient. This thing handles pricing info for my company and is cobbled together with VB, old .NET, and massive stored procedures. There’s zero automated tests or documentation. Just a couple of senior folks who have the tribal knowledge to keep this beast on life support.
 Here’s the kicker: one of them is always drowning in their own dev work, and the other is perpetually trapped in meetings. These are my go-to people for keeping things running, but getting help is like pulling teeth.
 Some of the “simple” changes they ask me to make are nightmares because I’m wading through ancient tech with no map. Plus, every time I ask questions, I get responses that feel more like bullying than guidance. It’s always “I’m right, you’re wrong, just do it my way so I can get back to my meeting.”
 I hate being bullied in meetings and during tasks. I’m trying to be thorough, but I’m terrified of breaking something in production because I don’t fully understand this dinosaur of a system. We’re supposed to sunset this app next year, but I don’t want to be stuck on this team that long. I’m already scoping out the job market, but it’s looking pretty grim out there.
 Any advice? How do I deal with the bullying and the stress of maintaining this relic? Anyone else stuck in a similar situation?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In regards to the new 'iterators' coming in Go 1.23, I stumbled upon some blog posts and chatter on social media talking about how this is an unnecessary language change. I was somewhat aware of the proposal and thought the func(func(T)bool) bool was a bit odd but after seeing this, I started investigating further and contributing to the discussion on https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61897
 I've always thought channels are the obvious choice for representing iterators (as they represent a stream, queue or sequence of values), naturally I assumed there must be a good reason why the language had to change the spec in order to support iterators (instead of adding compiler optimisations for channels to support this, I've even gone into some detail on how this could be implemented efficiently).
 The reaction I've received, however, is bizarre? I've been told it's too late to comment on this, it's already been decided. That channels must not be used for this (technically they can be used as iterators). Instead Go is adding special case functions to the language spec and a special case package iter just to support the same language semantics as receive-only channels?
 I've always considered Go (and the community) to be very cautious about making languages changes, not to add duplicate ways of representing the same thing. Pushing a cohesive and simple design. I'm curious, is it just me feeling like there is a major shift in principles here and is there anybody else who has had a look at this and thought the built-in channels are the obvious answer here?

 I'm getting some quirky behaviour these days like in XFCE 4.18 where it starts behaving like the <Super> key is being held down (it's not the keyboard, I have tried several), so typing becomes impossible without logging out of the desktop and back in again.
 So the question is, should I try and fix it, or should I go for a fresh install :-)

However, if different compilers are used (even on the same platform), each of them will generate different code and expect a different ABI.

 There are guidelines to achieve this by carefully designing the ABI. For instance, in Android:

How is this achieved? Is there a mechanism in C++ for easily subscribing to "contracts" (this function will implement begin, end, etc). In Java you might do this by having interfaces and having classes extend from them, but in C++ this involves virtual functions and has some runtime cost, and also removes some constexpr possibilities, so it can't be done like that. 
 Basically I'm asking "is there a way to have a bunch of c++ classes respect some contract without runtime polymorphism that is better than just documenting and remembering as a programmer which classes must be added?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello rustaceans! Several months ago, I open-sourced RMK, a keyboard firmware written in Rust. I got much more attentions and valuable feedbacks than I expected. Since then, RMK envolves a loooooooooot. Now I'd happy to annouce that RMK hits v0.2.0, with a bunch of exciting new features.
 The following is a simple list of important updates from v0.1.0.
  
Wireless support for nRF52 and esp32. RMK now supports BLE/USB dual mode with auto-switch feature
 A new configuration system based on toml. Now you can config almost everything of your keyboard with a single keyboard.toml, no Rust code is required! This makes RMK more user-friendly. If you want do more customization, you can still
 A new rapid debouncer, which would trigger the key first and then do debouncing
 Interrupt triggered matrix scanning, which reduces power consumption a lot
 Support more advanced keyboard feature: mouse key, media key and tap/hold feature
 Documentation and project-template got improved a lot
  
I also did some measurement about the performance and power consumption of RMK firmware. According to my testing on my nRF52840 GH60 board(open-sourced as rmk-ble-keyboard), the key latency of RMK is about 2 ms in wired mode and 10 ms in wireless(BLE) mode. The power consumption is about 200ua when advertising, 450ua when idling and 2ma when typing, which means RMK could provide about 2-3 months battery life with a 2000mah battery.
 In the duration of implementing RMK, I got lots of help from Rust community. The Rust community is so great. Also, the great tooling provided by Rust makes the dev experience quite pleasurable. Finally, I'm looking forward to more feedbacks about the project. Any kinds of suggestions/feedbacks are welcome :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello reddit, I’ve built a global serverless API gateway which handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, monitoring transformations etc.
 It’s entirely built on top of C# and .NET8 and uses the Microsoft Reverse Proxy (https://github.com/microsoft/reverse-proxy) at it’s core, for proxying the requests. It’s also inspired by the .NET architecture, with the notion of routes and middlewares and comes with a nice interface to configure everything in minutes (no code required).
 There are three main concepts:
  
Routes - paths that define different operations in your API (can be with dynamic, optional or catch-all parameters). It uses the .NET route matching for processing requests.
 Backends - a cluster of endpoints where the requests will be proxied to
 Middlewares - functions that are executed in a specific order in Routify edge proxies and define how requests are processed. These are similar as the .NET middlewares and policies approach. You can have global middlewares in app level that apply to all routes or you can have route specific middlewares. You can also disable a specific app middleware or you can disable all app middlewares in a specific route.
  
So far, it has processed 100+ million requests and works very fast (.NET8 is amazing). The average processing time for route matching and middleware processing is ~1ms (this does not include the network operations when proxying the requests).
 Routify makes it easier to manage and secure public APIs. It's distributed across many regions globally and acts as a proxy between your clients and your services.
 You can use it as a reverse proxy, as a gateway between your APIs in different cloud providers, as a geo load balancer or simply as a monitoring tool for all requests going through your API.
 For those interested, Routify is in public beta and freee to use at https://routify.to
 Check it out and let me know if you have any feedback or question. I’m happy to answer them.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently playing a lot with Arch (and it's a lot of fun!), in VMs and on a secondary SSD, to learn and get a feel for it. This weekend I will wipe my Windows installation and make a "final" installation (although let's be real, it will never really be final...).
 I notice I'm making a lot of tweaks to various files in /etc,... like configure Pacman mirrors, networking, tweak sound setup, mess with fstab, and much more.
 The problem is, I have failed to keep track of these changes. So when I will install my "final" setup, I will no doubt forget a lot of the tweaks I've made. It's not a big deal, I can just apply them again later, but still it's nice to remember and review these changes. Also maybe later in the future, if I want to install Arch elsewhere, or reinstall my system, it would be nice to see how my /etc will have deviated from the defaults...
 I have found etckeeper, which is nice and I'll probably check it out, but seems more about keeping a complete log of all changes to /etc, which is not entirely what I'm personally interested in. If I update some packages, and they replace some defaults with new defaults I probably won't care about it that much (unless everything breaks of course). But I am really interested in e.g. if manually made some tweaks to the NTP config which I want to replicate on my future laptop install.
 How do you manage this? Do you keep track of /etc changes at all? Don't care? Use etckeeper? Something else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's documentation on the Debian site, mailing lists, blog articles, and so on. I'm curious to hear from people with experience on authoring Debian packages: what steps do you need to take to go from having no experience at all in contributing a package to having it present in future stable versions of Debian?
 Some of you might recognise me as the original author of ALE, and a very small number might know I'm the President & Treasurer of the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organisation that holds the copyright for ALE and other projects, Dense Analysis. I love working on FOSS and will do in some capacity until my last breath.
 I really, really love xmms2 and I've been a regular user of it since around 2010. I was really sad last year when xmms2 just stopped working completely in KDE Neon, and then really happy recently when an update to the packages fixed everything. What's even better is that I wrote what I believe is a very good implementation of MPRIS integration for xmms2, which upon completing a recent update actually continued to fuction stably with zero changes to my code. I previously made a package available via an Ubuntu PPA I still use myself. (Eat your own dogfood.)
 Repeating my initial question, what should I reasonably do to move this package into Debian stable itself in future? I think mailing lists are a very 1990's thing and have always been strange to me, and I'm from 1989 myself. I am very comfortable with IRC, though it's been a while. How do Debian maintainers actually communicate and coordinate these days? Who should I speak with?

 Edit: What I learnt : 1) Networking is better when you network through socialising , hang out with your colleagues , catch up with your previous work employees so that when an opportunity comes to their mind they think of you first. 2) How do you get them to think of you as the person for the role : by doing good quality work , showing you’re easy to work with , finishing work on time and open to learning 3) don’t ask for referrals straight away , unless you know them before hand , avoid them feeling like you’re using them for something , form a bond 4) Networking grows when you’re in a good company so try your best to get into one , work hard , keep trying to get in eventually it’ll happen and then your network will grow stronger on its own.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I have 6 years of experience as a DevOps engineer, primarily working as a consultant with multiple clients. I’m currently based in Canada and I’m looking for advice on how to find clients for DevOps or software projects.
 In the UK, there's something called "outside IR35" that helps freelancers find clients without needing to rely heavily on networking. Is there a similar system or platform in Canada or the US that helps freelancers find clients? 
 If not, what are some effective ways to get software or DevOps projects apart from traditional networking?
 Thanks in advance for your help!

My question is, how do I apply multiple screens/pages in WPF. For example, a main menu, a login screen, and a signup screen? From what I've usually seen, desktop applications handle everything in the same window, so how is it usually done? Do I need to separate my Windows XAML into buttons and a frame that switches between the pages, similar to how Spotify (even though it's not in WPF), or Visual Studio 2022 are doing it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stronger question, why aren't any of the PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd and Ord traits (I would call them PEPO) unsafe?
 From the Rust Nomicon:
  
On trait declarations, unsafe means that implementors of the trait must check the trait documentation to ensure their implementation maintains the contracts the trait requires.
  
The PEPO traits have requirements which have to be upheld by implementors. Thus it would be natural for them to be unsafe, this is even suggested in the same chapter of the Nomicon. When the traits aren't marked as unsafe but have requirements unsafe code must assume the trait contracts don't always hold. I can also easily imagine a safe function implicitly relying on the reflexivity of Eq for example and thus behaving differently than it should, breaking it's own safe invariants.
 The reason behind not marking PEPO traits as unsafe is explained in the same chapter of the Nomicon:
  
The decision of whether to mark a trait unsafe is an API design choice. A safe trait is easier to implement, but any unsafe code that relies on it must defend against incorrect behavior. Marking a trait unsafe shifts this responsibility to the implementor. Rust has traditionally avoided marking traits unsafe because it makes Unsafe Rust pervasive, which isn't desirable.
  
This confuses me. How would marking the PEPO traits as unsafe make them harder to implement, when the trait contracts would be exactly the same and also, don't the benefits of marking the PEPO traits as unsafe outweigh the drawbacks? I would be glad to hear your opinions.

I have a class that manages stats and connection resources for a particular process and I'd like to re-use the instance across the process. So I was thinking of having a singleton of an unordered_map mapping int to my resource manager class
 static std::unordered_map<uint64_t, ResourceManager> manager_map; 
 But I'm not sure how to start. I'm strong in old-school C and I'm trying to get better at modern C++.
 How do I create new instances and put them (perhaps even "emplace" them???) into the map. Do I use new()? Do I need a mapping of objects, pointers, smart pointers?
 How do I ensure the destructor for ResourceManager gets called when the process exits?

 -Adding datasource via designer (I did it, but changes in the grid do not reflect in the database despite them being bound. Perhaps I need additional setup?)
 I can't find a straightforward answer online...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was laid off last month and have been doing tons of interviews. I applied to a senior DevOps role at one company, and did 3 interviews, very easy interviews I should add. Today I received an offer from that company, and noticed that they changed the role in the offer to lead DevOps engineer. I asked about this, since I thought it was a mistake, and was told that their senior role is for people with around 5 years experience, and since I have 7 years, it would need to be upgraded. 
 This seems a bit weird to me, even though I was assured it's not a management position and still very much technical and hands on. I'm kind of unsure about this, as it feels like it could be something I don't want and could be a trap. The company is 11,000+ employees, and I'm more used to working in startups and mid-sized companies.
 I should note also that I haven't ever had the official title of senior DevOps engineer. In fact it was a point of contention in my old company, as my previous boss would often tell me why I'm not a senior and would try to ridicule me in meetings. This kind of broke my confidence, and was probably why he chose me to be laid off first. 
 I'm unsure what to do here, as it's not something I've experienced before. Can any lead DevOps engineers share their experience, and what's involved in the job?

Usually I do my assessments and interviews and just by default assume its a reject. but with this one, I had my initial round which was an automated assessment, then I had another dsa round with a senior software dev. After that I had a round with the hiring manager and then with the director of technology and then eventually with the CEO of the company. Everything was going smooth. It's been almost 1.5 months since I'm prepping and giving interviews for this company just to get a reject today which says "the role requires stronger programming skills and financial knowledge" 
 Total 6 rounds and as I passed each round it gave me a little hope just for all the built up hope to tremble at the end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In December 2019 I was working full-time as a Business Intelligence dev and looking for a new job. I'd used up all of my vacation time going to interviews so I decided I would quit just before the holidays, spend time with family, then get back to searching full-time after winter.
 Well March 2020 rolls around and you know how the rest of that story goes...
 So now I have a 4-year gap in my resume and extremely dated skills. To make matters worse, I was working for a small company that was slow to adopt new tech so even in 2019 my skills were relatively dated. I spent most of my time writing SQL (Microsoft), developing reports in SQL Server Reporting Services and writing simple CRUD apps in C#.
 All of the jobs I see that mention those skills are also looking for a laundry list of other things that I have zero experience with (data science, web dev, etc.). I'm not sure where (or if) my job skills fit anywhere in the current market, if I'll need to start from scratch, or if I could possibly get some MS certs and find something similar. I am also considering moving into the woods and becoming a hermit.
 Any info, suggestions and insight on the current market would be appreciated.

 So I went and searched (also on this subreddit) ways to learn C, but people were recommending books I couldn't afford and I don't want to pirate them.
 The only free resources I found (aside from youtube) were beej.us and this github repo that contains free books who can be shared legally.
 What do you guys recommend me ?

 My expectation was that it would be internally handled and retried by various HTTP clients but this appears to not be the case. Of course if the target server is continuously resetting the connection I would then expect something to bubble up, or a connection timeout to be thrown when that limit is reached.
 Similarly if a target server responds 408, is that for the application code to implement handling in the retry policy? It's an interesting class of client error since the hope would be the library has disposed of the connection from its pool so a retry can be effective.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I have used Entity Framework for some project in the past, both with .net framework and .net core, in database first and code first version. 
 Coming to the conclusion that it is more disadvantages than advantages, while it makes my life easier on the other hand it introduces other problems , e.g. hard to write queries, read in linq. Excessive uncontrolled reads on the db and various headaches caused by unexpected engine behavior.
 After shelving Ef for years in favor of dapper (I got along very well with Dapper there is I used it for many projects), I continued to use entity only to generate filtered queries automatically . 
 Now I have to start a new very complex project and am writing the framework to be reused for various sub projects. I am adopting Ef code first, convinced by colleagues, however I keep thinking it will be a source of problems more than a real advantage and various limitations and difficulties are emerging already in the first tests where we are forced to use raw sql for partial updates in the la unit of work. 
 So I would like to use dapper and/or sugarsql on all queries at least at the framework level.
 Also considering that what I used to write with ef 7 years ago is pretty much to trash and what I wrote with dapper is fully functional , I think that ef in the long run its not the right choice.
 What is your experience with ef/dapper/sugar sql? What do you think of my reasoning?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In functions that only return an integer value to indicate success/failure-- why is the convention to return an integer, why not a char to save memory? I know it is a very small amount of memory, but I am more asking out of curiosity. Does the compiler convert it to a char implicitly? Surely there is a reason, and I was not able to find it from Google searches. I don't trust chat gpt either.
 EDIT: I hope it's obvious that I do not have much knowledge regarding low level topics like how CPU registries are handled. (I plan on diving into assembly very soon--I'm a sophomore CS student.) Your guys' answers were very helpful, though!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Considering a “Windows tweaking” program to do a few things that many other Windows-castration apps don’t seem to be doing. But I haven’t exactly done a Windows program before, at least in terms of an executable program that can be run in portable format, and possibly even installed (in some future version) for scheduled monitoring.
 In general, when dealing with Windows internals for purely Win10 and Win11, would you preferentially reach for a DotNet Framework or a DotNet Core setup?
 Looking for reasoning. My background is mainly in Enterprise-level CRUD Intranet apps for companies, which would run locally on their network from a server. So it’s not like I have oodles of experience creating programs for the desktop. I know Framework is on it’s way out, but I have also heard that it still has superior third-party resources for Windows-specific capabilities and needs.
 The vast majority of the app’s functionality will be in modifying the registry in a safe/programmatic way, and running specific PowerShell commands. Depending on requirements, some may be isolated as vertical slice components, others may have a shared “applying engine” against which instructions can be run. This will be protected behind a very simple checkbox-based or slider-button-based UI.
 Final note: this will NOT be released through the Windows Store, as I highly doubt it would ever get approved there. Straight download only. I also intend this to have a more traditional Windows-like UI, and a standard *.exe binary with no external files except for text-based “sanity/changes-implemented references” that are filename-locked to whatever system they were generated against, in case the executable ends up on a USB stick or network share to be applied to multiple systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Way too many of you guys are hating on the prep you need to do to break into Big Tech, saying it's useless, it's not real engineering, that they don't test real world things.
 I have to be real with you all. What do you think requires more real engineering skills?
 Company 1 , that asks you random trivia about react, to code up a simple component or design / consume a simple API ?
 Or Company 2, that grills you on system design and architecture questions, writing clean, modular code with all the famous design patterns, asking you fundamentals about data structures, algorithms and problem solving ? How about the gigantic emphasis on behavioural too? Prepping for that really improves your communication skills and shows you how to focus on business impact.
 I think most of the hate comes from the fact that most people simply don't have the willpower to do it.
 But doing it will absolutely make you a better engineer than you were before.

 I am still learning. 
 I have been making console apps where the user can choose an option, sort of like a main menu, and then execute whatever action based on the selection.
 However, this current build just keeps going down and down the program... 
 How can I ... if its even possible, to make the command window clear the current display and load the next display based on the selected option??
 Example: I gather user information using cwrite and read, and once I gather the information, it takes them to "another screen" where it shows the main menu options they now have access too, vs just printing the information below it.
 Almost like clearing the screen before running the next actions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been googling like a maniac and am still confused about how the C standard library is provided and used on different systems and compilers.
 Why is the C standard library shipped with the OS, and not with the compiler? For example, glibc on Linux and ucrt on Windows? And how does the compiler enter the picture here? Like does it care about the standard library (and/or the OS API)? Or does it just generate binary for whatever source code is given to it without caring about anything else (except the target platform for which it is designed of course)?
 Also, according to the knowledge I've gathered, it should be totally possible for you to not use the standard library at all (I mean there is literally a nostdlib option in GCC), right? After all it is just a library in the end. There's also the prospect of the runtime library, which I think is just startup and exit routine (crt0.o. Please correct me if I am wrong). Can we also replace this library with our own? I think that should be possible because we just need OS API calls (like the functions in windows.h).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! So I started working as a DevOps engineer at the start of this year. I wanted to ask some insights on how to deal with people who don't really know the real role of a DevOps engineer. 
 So our Dev lead in our team thinks that the role of DevOps is to just take care of the deployment of our services, scan vulnerabilities and that's it. I created some processes to improve the config management of our app services but they are not really following it for some reason. I also added some status checks on our repos to improve the code quality that devs are adding on to our app but I keep on getting complains as to why they need to wait for those checks to finish everytime they have a PR. Our Dev lead keeps on insisting that we should keep our responsibilities only for deployment and not care about the code(in terms of quality and vulnerabilities) they are adding on to the repo. It's slowly getting toxic already. I keep on thinking about ways to improve the CICD process of the team but they keep on ignoring the process. I even do KT sessions to the team and ask whether they have some opinions on the process but thats just it, they attend the session and then go back to their old ways right after 
 It's so frustrating already. Can I ask some tips on how to deal with these kind of people who dont really know what DevOps are supposed to do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just had my first interview (yup! very happy, after like 12 months of searching!). It was over zoom, and it was with my would-be supervisor (director of engineering) and the director of marketing, and one other person, not even sure who they were though. 
 I knew it wouldn't be a very difficult interview cause it's with a very small non-tech company in my state, and the position would be doing web development for our clients and partners. Anyways, the recruiter just told me that "entry-level CS knowledge would suffice"
 So after talking about myself for 5-10 minutes, the director of engineering said "are you ready for the technical part of the interview"
 Me: "Sure"
 Him: "Don't worry we don't like to have candidates stress. We just want someone that is motivated and willing to learn."
 Me: "Awesome, that sounds great."
 Him: "Okay, now I want you to "clap" when the right answer is read aloud, okay?"
 Me: "Okay" *thinking, okay did I hear that right? That's strange*
 Him: "First question. Which tool is used for styling a webpage? A.) HTML, B.) Javascript, C.) Django, or D.) CSS"
 Me: *claps when I hear CSS*
 Him: "Great! Next question: API stands for A.) "App Programming Initiative", B.) "Angular Programming Interface", C.) "Application Programming Interface"
 Me: *claps when I hear the correct option for API"
 Him: "Excellent!!! You're one of the best candidates we've had so far!"
 Me: *trying not to laugh* "thank you!"
 So basically, yeah the interview was just that for like, 10 minutes (the questions were legit mostly that easy, yes, with a couple questions asking what a particular paradigm or basic python function might do). 
 So yeah, has anyone ever had a clap-along interview before or just me?

 The phone should have good support, decent performance, and cover essential features (i.e. Cellular Calling, SMS/MMS, WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, GPU Acceleration, Proper Time, Camera, etc).
 EDIT: A lot of people seem to confuse the two. I’m talking about Linux *proper*, not Android. I’m not looking into using it for everyday use, but rather something to use as a side project. It can be GNU/Linux, it can be Busybox/Linux, you get the idea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My router is dual band with the same SSID, meaning it automatically switches to whichever band is best for a device. When using Kismet, I can see two MAC addresses on two channels. However, when scanning with Airgeddon (using the same instance of Kali with the same hardware), only the 2.4GHz MAC is shown.
 When testing and running Airgeddon on the visible network, it disconnects all my devices except those on the 5GHz channel. I tried manually running aireplay-ng using the 5GHz MAC as the target, but it tells me it's an invalid address.
 Does anyone know the best way to approach this? Would I need 2 wireless NICs? One to run airgeddon on 2.4ghz and one to deauth 5ghz?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vaadin 24.4 is a big release with a minor version number: 
  
React is now a first-class citizen in Vaadin 
 The Hilla framework is now part of the core platform
 You can add React views by adding views to the `src/mainfrontend/views` folder
 You can use Flow components in React views
 You can use React components in Flow view
 You can have React and Java-based views in the same project
 
 Vaadin Copilot 
 Vaadin Copilot is a code-first coding assistant that lets you edit your running app.
 Copilot supports drag and drop editing, theme customization, a11y inspection, and AI-based code modification/generation.
 
  
Although we're releasing big new features, it's a non-breaking change for Vaadin Flow users (hence the minor release). If you're coming from earlier versions of Hilla, you need to update some imports and package names, full instructions here. 
 The release blog post goes into detail on our vision for the future of Vaadin if you're curious about why we added React support to the Vaadin platform.

 I already have these images in the project directory, but I'm unable to publish a new version to Crates.io because my crate is too large. The size limit is 10 MB, whereas my crate is 15.7 MB after compression.
 I need to be able to use these images in the code, so what alternatives do I have?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to share my recent experience and I hope someone could related to it. Around 3 months ago I have joined very big team (around 20 devs) as lead frontend developer. I had some struggles here and there but in the end I managed to adapt to team and learn their processes.
 Currently everything seems to be fine and I kinda enjoy my work. But working as lead and being responsible for huge codebase gave me few conclusions:
  
Doesn’t matter how hard I work, I cannot out perform many developers and surely can’t help with their work and do mine at the same time.
 
I finally understood what means “good enough”. I don’t have enough time to make things perfect, because tons of things are going in the background, and some improvements/fixes must be done asap.
 
People don’t seem to care about code quality that much. Everyone is focused on having optimal solution and fast execution.
 
I don’t want to nick pick other devs merge requests. I don’t even see that much value there. So many peopling editing same codebase, just leaves no room for asking eveyrone to follow perfect coding standards.
 
 I want to you fellow redditors, what have you realised after working with big team or working as lead developer?
 Edit: Thank you everyone for comments, I really learned something that I did not even think of!

 https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/14m9gxq/mouse_input_lag/
 Today I accidentally found a fix and possibly bug in Gnome. I started game through terminal as usual and there was mouse delay. Then I rebooted machine and locked screen since I had to left for few minutes when I came back I unlocked screen, I run the game thorugh terminal again and I was surprised my mouse worked flawlessly. I rebooted machine run the game again and there was delay again. I started to think what I did differently and came to conclusion that I locked screen. So I tried again I rebooted, locked screen wait some seconds unlocked screen run the game and there was no delay again. Not sure why that happens but perhaps something is funky with compositor when locking/unlocking screen?
 tl;dr Locking and unlocking screen with meta+L shortcut fixes the issue for some reason.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work as the sole programmer in a small nonprofit, maintaining a legacy C# application. The program has a Customer class, Plan class, and Note class, with most functions tied to the Customer class.
 I'm adding a feature to calculate remaining hours in a plan, where hours are recorded in the notes. I see two options: 1. Add these functions to the already large Customer class. 2. Calculate total hours in the Note class and then pass this to the Plan class to compute remaining hours.
 Should I follow the existing pattern and add functions to the Customer class? If I were writing this program from scratch, would breaking it out differently be a better approach?

 uint8_t lsb = cpu_read(cpu, cpu->regs.sp); cpu->regs.sp++; 
 And I am wondering if it is OK (well-defined) to combine the two lines like so
 uint8_t lsb = cpu_read(cpu, cpu->regs.sp++); 
 My understanding is that all effects like increment are evaluated before the function call, but because cpu appears twice, I'm not sure if it is okay.
 And if so, I have another snippet:
 cpu->regs.sp--; cpu_write(cpu, cpu->regs.sp, extract_msb(cpu->regs.pc)); 
 Is it okay to write it as
 cpu_write(cpu, --cpu->regs.sp, extract_msb(cpu->regs.pc)); 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my app is semi-finished, it already does what it has to, when I have more time I'll improve the GUI or some other stuff about it.
 The problem is that I've noticed during my completely amateur testing that there's times it takes it 5 seconds to change the BitLocker PIN and export the key, sometimes only 2. Usually only 2 seconds but even that isn't fast enough for me. 
 When I had this app completely in powershell, I accepted it being due to the fact it was in powershell. Interpreted is going to be slow compared to compiled
 But this one is entirely WMI-based, no powershell, no cmdline arguements, just C# using WMI calls. And it's compiled. 
 So I'm looking for ways to make my app faster. Ideally it'd take it 1 second - no more - to delete the current TPMAndPin protector, delete the current Numerical Password, change the TpmAndPin protector to the user's input and then export the auto-generated Numerical Password to the given location
 As I said, sometimes this takes 2 seconds, sometimes 4-5. Ideal time would be 1 second.
 I'd go for asynchronous but in this case these things have to happen in this specific order. If the TpmAndPin isn't deleted before a new one is created, the new one won't be created because the system cannot contain more than 1 TpmAndPin protector.
 Can I get some help with this? Any ideas, thoughts, input?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work as a software engineer at a Big N (are we still using this term?) / FAANG company. I've been here for 3 years and admittedly haven't been doing well for most of my time here.
 My manager has been hot and cold with my quarterly reviews - one review he'll say I'm doing better and improving at a great pace, and another he's giving me what is essentially a PIP. I know I should've tried to leave sooner but I was stubborn and genuinely thought I could improve. I find the code base difficult to understand and navigate, but thought that with enough time it would eventually click. I'm not a lazy worker, I put out good work but my manager says I'm not fast enough with it.
 Recently he approached me basically telling me I'm on the verge of losing my job. He's already in touch with HR about it. I'm on some accommodations for health issues so he said they won't let me go right away, but that upper management is "looking for a small team of high performers". I have no idea if anybody else is going through the same thing as me. At this rate I don't expect to have my job by next month or so. It feels as though no matter how hard I try, it doesn't make a difference. I'm heartbroken because this whole ordeal left me feeling like maybe I'm just not cut out to be a good engineer/programmer.
 I've been looking for other positions internally for my level, but those are hard to come by, are usually for other countries, and receive literally thousands of applications, so I haven't even been able to get a single interview after at least two months of looking.
 I love working here and ideally I would like to stay. But I already have two "PIPs" on my record. So getting an internal position feels impossible. And with the way the industry is right now, I'm afraid of being without a job for a long time to come.
 What are my options? What would you do in my position? Any advice is appreciated.

 I'm a 16-year-old 10th grader currently diving into the world of web development. I've been learning JavaScript for a while now, and I'm about 30% through the "Definitive JavaScript" book and also following an online course.
 I recently reached out to my cousin, who has been a web developer for about 4 years, to get some tips on JavaScript. However, he advised me to stop learning JavaScript, saying the web development market is saturated. Instead, he recommended I focus on AI, learn C++, and dive into data structures and algorithms (DSA).
 Now I'm a bit confused about what to do next. Should I:
  
Leave JavaScript and start learning C++ and AI immediately?
 Complete my current JavaScript learning path before moving on to C++ and AI?
  
Would love to hear your thoughts and advice on this. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been learning Go for a few months now and I'm currently struggling with how to structure my project's folders. Most of the examples I've found are for smaller projects and don't fit my needs. My current structure looks like this:
 │ .env │ .gitignore │ .golangci.yml │ docker-compose.yml │ Dockerfile │ go.mod │ go.sum │ Makefile │ Procfile │ │ ├───certs │ access-private.pem │ access-public.pem │ refresh-private.pem │ refresh-public.pem │ ├───cmd │ ├───api │ main.go │ ├───config │ config.go │ ├───db │ database.go │ ├───internal │ └───auth │ ├───delivery │ │ └───http │ │ login_handler.go │ │ register_handler.go │ │ routes.go │ │ │ ├───models │ │ auth_models.go │ │ login_request.go │ │ login_response.go │ │ │ ├───repository │ │ auth_repository.go │ │ │ └───service │ auth_service.go │ │ ├───templates │ confirm_mail.html │ password_reset.html │ template.go │ └───utils logger.go util.go 
 Each Go file's package is named after its directory. I'm wondering if this is a good structure or if I'm breaking any best practices. I like this setup but I'm unsure where to place various models (request, response, database models, and business logic models). Should each folder have its own models.go file?
 The project has about 25 handlers for actions like login, register, verify email, refresh token, etc.
 Any advice on structuring this with explanations would be very helpful. I understand there is no perfect way, but there must be some guidelines to follow.

 I work in bank with Oracle databases (PL/SQL language). My company is forcing me to use the PL/SQL developer IDE with no chance to use different IDE.
 I hate that tool - its like some dinosaur IDE from early 2000. No dark mode (this is huge, i hate looking at withe screen for 8 hours straight, syntax highlighting sucks (like VScode is 10x better), no Intellisense, no Copilot, code indending sucks, no built-in git tools.
 I checked, and there is no way to change these things in settings.
 In my spare time i code in VScode or Jetbrains IDE and damn - these things are really good.
 I am thinking of leaving for another job just because the horrible IDE. What do you think? Is this a legitimate concern or do you think that leaving your job just because an IDE is stupid?
 Edit: This is corporate, they gave me old laptop with 8gb ram. Only approved sw can be installed on it.

 I'm trying to list files and directories quickly in a recursive manner.
 The easy way to do that is to use plocate or find.
 I started with find, but it's so slow when you have tens of millions of directories.
 I found a really smart way to extract lists by using getdents system call from this person:
 http://be-n.com/spw/you-can-list-a-million-files-in-a-directory-but-not-with-ls.html 
 I built and ran the application and it was an over an order of magnitude faster than the find utility.
 But when I wanted to run this recursively, I get a segmentation fault when it's recursing for the first time.
 I have no idea what's wrong, and was hoping I could get some expert hints from the community.
 Can you help me figure out why I'm segfaulting?
 Here's the code I have for the recursive meth…]]></summary>

 We'll use Python to automate some build steps. We could write Python either in a more scripting/imperative way, or go full object oriented.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever someone on my team (of about 6 people) submits a code review, all team members are included as reviewers, along with subject matter experts from other teams when appropriate. I make it a point to participate in every code review, regardless of my familiarity with the code in question. When I'm not familiar with the code, I focus on identifying basic issues such as dereferencing null pointers, code smells, and any naming or comments that seem unclear or inappropriate. My team is highly competent, so I seldom find myself contributing significantly in these instances. I've noticed that many people, upon encountering unfamiliar code, choose not to review it at all. This has led me to question whether those who opt out are actually taking the correct approach and whether my efforts have merely been adding unnecessary noise to the review process for years. How do you all manage such situations? What do you believe is the correct approach?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently came to the conclusion that old programming books are better than new ones. This will be preposterous to some and, I suspect, obvious to others. 
 Old books are better because those that remain in the public consciousness are certified classics. They have withstood the tests of time, remaining relevant, which means they must have value of some kind. 
 This value is two-fold. They either provide technical knowledge that has remained timeless or they provide valuable historical context, and the outdated technical knowledge can be overlooked. 
 Historical context is not something that many people look for in programming books, but they should. Understanding the history of an idea helps us understand the idea in greater detail. Particularly, most of the history of computer science was driven by individuals who aimed to solve relevant problems within constraints. By understanding who these individuals were, the problems they were trying to solve, and the constraints they operated within, we are able to better understand the ideas and tools that were developed. 
 For example, I would highly recommend The Design and Evolution of C++ by Bjarne Stroustroup. This book teaches history, philosophy, language building, low-level programming, and effective design in the context of C++, covering why and how it was developed. 
 When you read old programming books, whether for technical know-how or historical facts, you begin to see that everyone involved was human. Everything in programming makes sense to humans because it was designed by humans. The pioneers who came before, although extremely talented, were humans like you or me, and this is a reassuring thought to remember. 
 I would recommend reading old books, especially for beginners. They provide context in a seemingly context-less world and help to make sense of the complexity of programming. 
 Hope this helps someone!

 I'm fairly new to the language and I'm just using it to see if my answer to a probability problem is right. Since I couldn't find the problem online and I can't reach the professor who showed it to me I thought I would exploit the law of large numbers and simulate a large number of cases to see if the statistics were at all close to the value I had calculated. The problem was: out of 6 dice throws what is the probability of obtaining only two numbers that don't repeat? (meaning the other four are either all the same or two same couples) This is the code I wrote to simulate the situation but I found that after a big enough number of cases the "random" dice throws start to repeat. ls there a better way to simulate such a situation?

 You might be aware that the HelpNDoc help authoring tool can generate code from documentation projects, enabling developers to access specific topics within the generated help files through context-sensitive help.
 We have received requests to include a C# code generator. To ensure we meet the needs of developers effectively, we are seeking input on the preferred code format.
 For your reference, we have provided two examples of Visual Basic code currently generated by HelpNDoc. Your feedback on these examples, and any suggestions for the C# code format, would be greatly appreciated.
 Using enums:
 Public Enum eHelp_Title of this help project HELP_Introduction = 0 HELP_WelcomeMessage = 1 HELP_PurposeoftheManual = 2 HELP_ImportanceofCustomerService = 3 HELP_OverviewofTrainingProgram = 4 HELP_CompanyOverview = 5 HELP_CompanyMissionandVision = 6 HELP_CoreValues = 7 HELP_ServicePhilosophy = 8 HELP_OrganizationalStructure = 9 End Enum 
 And using consts:
 public const HELP_Introduction as integer = 0 public const HELP_WelcomeMessage as integer = 1 public const HELP_PurposeoftheManual as integer = 2 public const HELP_ImportanceofCustomerService as integer = 3 public const HELP_OverviewofTrainingProgram as integer = 4 public const HELP_CompanyOverview as integer = 5 public const HELP_CompanyMissionandVision as integer = 6 public const HELP_CoreValues as integer = 7 public const HELP_ServicePhilosophy as integer = 8 public const HELP_OrganizationalStructure as integer = 9 
 As an example, the format for the line HELP_Introduction = 0 is:
  
Introduction: Help ID
 0: Help context number

One of the guys runs a software company and claims that he was able to replace 9 devs in the Philippines with one full stack engineer and AI.
 Now my CEO is asking me if we can do the same with our dev team in Europe. The problem is my team is small with 1 FE, 1 BE, 1 DevOps, 1 DBA, 1 BA, and 1 SA. They’re all really specialized. Maybe I could get someone who’s full stack to do the job of the FE and BE, but I’d still need 2 FTEs just to achieve the same output. 
 I’m pretty certain our CEOs peer was embellishing his claim a bit. But he’s convinced we can do the same. Anyone have advice on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I've recently picked up C again after not using it for while, and I'm trying to do things the "C" way :). I've been reading some codebases, but haven't been able to decide what is the best way to do the following: I have a function that parses command line arguments:
 struct args { ... bunch of arguments struct some_other_struct* ptrmember; } struct args args_parse(int argc, const char **argv); 
 This initial version returns struct args by value. I'm not entirely sure if it is the way to go, since it is a somewhat large struct (5 members), more importantly, the ptrmember member inside needs to be free'd, and it feels like returning a struct by value implies that there is no cleanup needed. I'm also not sure if I should make the caller responsible for free'ing free(args.ptrmember) or have a args_free function which does it.
 Some alternatives that may be better:
 int args_parse(int argc, const char **argv, struct args* out); 
  
Added benefit of having return value.
 Allows caller to decide whether to allocate args on heap or put it on stack.
 Still it is not entirely clear as to whether the caller is responsible for free'ing ptrmember I feel like (since it is allocated by args_parse, but the caller initialized the containing struct).
  
Or may be the C way is to not use a struct at all and just have a bunch of out parameters like so:
 int args_parse(int argc, const char **argv, enum action* out_action, struct some_other_struct* out_ptrmember); 
  
This one makes it very clear that the caller is responsible for freeing out_ptrmember IMO, but I'm not sure if it is best practice to use out variables so liberally here.

 Seriously, I run a small marketing agency so it's not like we have anything valuable online so hacking in doesn't seem to be the goal. I'd say it was simply a DDOS by why the contact pages then?
 Requests came from IPs all over the world, most of which were either through a proxy company or were blacklisted domains belonging to spammers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in my first year of university, studying computer science. Wheny professor explained recursion, he did not specify whatsoever the cases in which it is actually beneficial. 
 In the presentation he made, there's two whole slides explaining the downsides of recursion, but all we got for positives was a generic "good software engineering".
 So are there actually cases in which using recursion is better?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 I was learning on how to make a ray tracer by The Cherno. I have intermediate programming skills, and I thought I could handle it. But immediately I hit my first roadblock with C++. I don't know how to even run the project in the first place(apart from a single file Hello World with a header.h). What makes it even more complicated, he is using a solution file with Visual Studio to compile all of this stuff. But I'm on Linux, and use VSCode. So that was a bust. I tried to run it normally by running gcc to the WalnutApp.cpp but that is giving me include header directory errors(not found). So it's very disheartening for me, that for C++ to work, I have to learn CMake. Which is way too complicated for me to even begin to understand. What do I do? Where do I even begin?
 Here is the template I use for the project incase you wanted to know: https://github.com/StudioCherno/WalnutAppTemplate

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a beginner C programmer, I'm confused a lot by this example.
  
Why printArray and printArrayPointer has same inner code, but first function accepts int arr[], and the second one - int *arr? When you pass an array to a function, you are actually passing a pointer to the first element of the array. So int arr[] equivalent to int *arr? Why?
 
Why arr[i] works in printArrayPointer methods? This first argument must be a pointer to a first element in the array, not an array itself. So why on earth arr[i] works?
 
 ```c
 int main(void) { int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
 printArray(arr, size); printArrayPointer(arr, size); printArrayPointerArithmetic(arr, size);
 return 0; }
 void printArray(int arr[], int size) { for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { printf("%d ", arr[i]); } printf("\n"); }
 void printArrayPointer(int *arr, int size) { for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { printf("%d ", arr[i]); } printf("\n"); }
 void printArrayPointerArithmetic(int *arr, int size) { for (int *ptr = arr; ptr < arr + size; ptr++) { printf("%d ", *ptr); } printf("\n"); } ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically a class where the pass rate is very low and the professor is unironically an elden beast.
 For my school it was Physics I and Signal Processing. Both had very kind and funny professors who were extremely rigorous in grading and cared a lot about the theory and proof. Both exams had mandatory oral exams where you had to solve questions on the whiteboard and the prof. could fail you even if you passed the written exam if they were unsatisfied.
 The pass rate on the first try was %34, and %19 respectively (actually crazy ik). I literally read Newton's Principia Mathematica to impress my phy1 prof and pass on the second try. Glad those are behind me now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Class with a Dictionary that contains Strings and and Int, and I'm trying to use GetValue, SetValue to get and set them from string names. So from the start, I know the type (Dictionary) but I only have two strings to work with. (I know somebody is probably going to ask why are you doing this with reflection, but I'm trying to learn how to access dictionary using only reflection). This is as far as I've got.
 public class bookstore
 {
 Dictionary <string, int> tolstoy = new Dictionary <string,int>
 {"war and peace", 0}
 {"resurrection", 1}
 }
 Dictionary <string,int> dostoy = new Dictionary<string, int>
 {
 "crime and punishment",1}
 }
 }
 So now let's say I'm only given the name of the dictionary as a string name like this: bookset="tolstoy" and a string bookname ="war and peace", how to get at the dictionary (bookset) and then set the value for bookname to 1 using only reflection? The dictionaries are in another class of their own, "bookstore"
 public class BookOrders
 {
 string bookname="war and peace";
 string bookset ="tolstoy";
 Type booktype = typeof(BookOrders);
 int book_amount = (int) booktype.GetProperty(bookname).GetValue(???);
 //What do I put in GetValue() to get the int, the amount of books for that book--- ?
 How do I set the dictionary property using reflection?
 booktype.GetProperty(bookname).SetValue(???, 1);
 //What do I put in SetValue() to set the book amount (int) in the dictionary bookset ("tolstoy").
 }
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm proposing an enhancement to ISO C++'s threading capabilities, envisioning a more comprehensive module (std::multi_thread as a concept) that encapsulates advanced features such as asynchronous processing, thread pooling, and refined multithreading controls, inspired by the elegance of JavaScript's async patterns. My motivation stems from the current limitations of std::thread in terms of customization and the complexities encountered when applying std::async and std::future to classes and containers.
 I aim to streamline concurrent programming by introducing more intuitive and flexible APIs, reducing boilerplate code, and enhancing performance through intelligent resource management akin to thread pools. This new module would not replace but complement existing standards, offering developers a more powerful toolset for managing concurrency in modern, complex applications.
 I'm eager to gauge the C++ community's thoughts on this proposal. Have you encountered similar challenges with the current threading model? Do you envision benefits in having a more integrated, high-level threading solution within the language standard? If this idea sparks your interest or you have suggestions to refine it, please share your thoughts in the comments! Thanks!

 TL;TR;
 Is the code from pret/pokeemerald following good or bad practice?
 Full story: So this might be very specific because this is about the Pokémon decompilation project by Pret. The reason why I ask here instead of a sub about Romhacking is basically that I just care about the C code inside that project and I want "professional" opinions. I can imagine that a lot of people from romhacking subs or communities are self taught but only in the context of the decomps. They might not learned C but rather how to achieve things within the decomps. Don't get me wrong there are some insane developers in the community but it feels more safe to get an opinion about practices and design of the code from a neutral and professional point of view.

The default BitLocker PIN enforced by MBAM was (insert 9 numbers here), and you had to change it as the first thing after logging in post-autopilot-run. 
 I thought that was pretty cool so I made the app myself using WMI. 
 What about you guys, have you ever had to create small GUI apps like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven’t seen it this bad since 2001, this is worse than the pandemic. I’ve worked with front and back end JavaScript for a long time. The past few years, the quality of the codebases I’ve inherited has been abysmal. I worked on a software product from a well known company, with tens of thousands of users, that provided a user experience that could only be described as grueling. I’ve interviewed dozens of developers over the past few years and many did not display basic, fundamental knowledge.
 This is to say, I never expected to have trouble finding work for the foreseeable future. IME, there’s no shortage of work that needs to be done. I have been looking for two months and have not had a single interview. A friend, who is a very strong dev, told me that 3 devs he currently works with have been looking for other jobs for 6-9 months and they’ve found nothing, and he says they’re good. He believes that employers know this, and are using it to squeeze more work out of people. Every employed developer I’ve talked to is overworked and stressed out. 
 What is going on? This is not normal. I have a couple of theories, but when I hear myself explaining them, I sound like a crackpot.
  
Employers are frustrated at developers refusing to return to the office and are applying pressure
 With a polarizing presidential election this year, companies are reluctant to make long term plans and commit to budgets when the business environment could be drastically different, come January, depending on the winner
 Employers are creating artificial job scarcity in order to influence the outcome of the election 
  
This is not a political post, please don’t flame me. I’m just perplexed by this job market when overall unemployment is at an all time low and the economy is supposedly strong. I did not have trouble finding work in 2008, when the economy was in the toilet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been struggling to wrap my head around our application sets and helm charts for a year now. My boss wrote them from scratch and what we do every time we have a new microservices or app is copy the last one and modify it. So far so good… However we have a very complex and flexible hierarchy of values, templates, and stuff that I don’t even know if they’re normal terms — trigger files and seed files, which a python script takes as inputs to generate the app set.
 We have a multi-tenant architecture in regions all over the world in both AWS and Azure, and of course many environments, including the standard dev/qa/prod as well as cloud vs on-prem, so this is part of the reason for the open-ended nature of the way he designed things. It feels like a very loose (undocumented) framework that requires complete knowledge in. It’s pure gitops which I love, but often I find myself staring at a yaml and wondering what something does, how it fits in, and if it’s overridden somewhere else. I spend a lot of time recursive grepping, looking at Argo overrides (I hate the tag bubble format), and in general wasting time. 
 In a way this reminds me of Puppet hiera, but obviously more complex. The fix for that was Foreman with the UI that had taxonomy and inheritance. Is there anything like that for helm values? Is there any automation tool or popular framework that creates standardized app sets? (And helm charts?) Again the parallel would be something like creating an rpm from scratch vs having a polished script or tool like fpm to standardize the process. I’d love to have a Wizard-like tool guide me through the process. “Does your app need to talk to kube-API? No? Then you don’t need a dedicated service account. Let’s delete that from the chart so it doesn’t blow up when you don’t set values for it.” Etc. 
 I’m a smart guy but this really feels like the Wild West out here.

Searching for posts asking a similar question basically just have people suggesting the Windows 95 icons, which match fine, it just completely pisses me off when stuff like the downloads folder are given the Internet Explorer icon on a Linux system (no I’m not going to decompile IE 5 for UNIX and then recompile it for Linux just so the icon matches) or when office suites have their icons replaced by MS-Office icons. I’m fine with icon sets from other OSes, as long as they don’t essentially brand the current OS as something else.
 The only other icon set I can think of are the CDE icons, which are fine, but they fit better with MWM than TWM

This is an area that I need to work on more. When I’m out of my comfort zone (e.g. the code base is in a programming language that I’ve never coded in) my progress is very slow. Do you use any strategies to get familiar with a new code base quickly as an experienced developer? For example, one strategy I use is to do code reviews on existing PRs, ask questions in the PR if something is not clear. I started doing this recently and I wish I did it sooner. Looking for similar tips and strategies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am messing around with cookie auth and am not sure if I am over thinking this. I can make a bunch of requests to my login endpoint using powershell after one attempt in the browser using the network tools. Here is my code. .NET 8, MVC.
 Form:
 @using (Html.BeginForm("Login", "Account", FormMethod.Post)) { <div class="mb-3"> <label for="firstName" class="form-label fw-bold">First Name</label> <input type="text" class="form-control" id="firstName" name="FirstName" value="@Model?.FirstName" required> @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model => model.FirstName) </div> <div class="mb-3"> <label for="lastName" class="form-label fw-bold">Last Name</label> <input type="text" class="form-control" id="lastName" name="LastName" value="@Model?.LastName" required> @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model => model.LastName) </div> <div class="mb-3"> <label for="email" class="form-label fw-bold">Email address</label> <input type="email" class="form-control" id="email" name="Email" value="@Model?.Email" required> @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model => model.Email) </div> <div class="d-grid gap-2"> <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg p-3">Do stuff</button> </div> } 
 Controller:
 [HttpPost] [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] public async Task<ActionResult> LoginAsync(LoginRequest loginRequest) { // ... } 
 This works as expected. Login is hit, blah blah blah. But when I started messing with my brower dev tools, I was able to see everything I entered, copy the request and resend it as many times as I wanted via Powershell. And because I could see what I entered, I could change the values and include the anti forgery token and now I have the power to write a script to basically brute force login details. I must have done something terribly wrong, right? Is it possible to protect against this? Am I over thinking this?
 My request payload
 How I got the powershell
 And running the powershell triggers my breakpoint, and I've circled the body with my data that I can easily change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm sure this is a really simple question, but how can I make sure I get the low and high bits regardless of endianness?
 Specifically, I'm trying to avoid having code on my machine split a u16 like 0xABCD into 0xAB and 0xCD, passing it over serial, and having the device on the other end reconstruct it as 0xCDAB.
 If I put the values in a u8 array, I know they get sent and parsed in the same order on both ends.
 So the challenge is splitting the u16 into two u8's in a hardware agnostic way. Would bit shifts be enough for that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have made a few games before that were SFW and am using an alt account to ask if people would play this or not. I want to make a game that is like PowerWash Simulator but instead of objects you'd be washing...people and spirits, NSFW.
 My idea is you work at a bathhouse and a diverse variety of people/spirits that are caked in things like monster guts, mud, slime, all the filth that comes with an adventure, are your general cliental that you have to wash. As you progress in the game you'd unlock better things like higher grade nozzles, soaps, "bath bomb" style stuff and more for the harder to clean guests, and you'd unlock better baths and rooms too.
 You'd get a score based on how well of job you did and the time you did it in. As you progress through the story unlocking rooms and baths, you'd also unlock the characters that you washed and there would be a "casual" mode where you could redo specific levels.
 As NSFW game, would people play this? Does it sound at all fun/interesting? I don't know much at all about the NSFW game market.

 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.dbset-1?view=efcore-8.0 
 It implements the `IEnumerable` interface and it has access to methods like `Take()` etc. 
 However when I look at the documentation regarding `IEnumerable` it doesn't have a `Take()` method. It says it has one method, `GetEnumerator()`. 
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.ienumerable?view=net-8.0
 It turns out that the `Enumerable` class has all these described methods instead. Enumerable implements `IEnumerable`
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable?view=net-8.0
 What I don't understand is how does `DbSet<TEntity>` has access to all the methods of `Enumerable` when it is implementing the class of `IEnumerable` which doesn't have the methods of `Enumerable`?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made the switch from engineer manager to IC as a senior software engineer 2 months ago. Initially I was very excited for the new role. However, after being here 2 months I've been constantly under stress due to feeling like I'm not meeting the bar as a senior engineer. 
 What is not helping either, is that at the same time I joined, there was an internal hire who joined at the same time as a mid-level engineer. The problem here is that they have already been contributing to the code base and very familiar with a lot of the inner workings of the company.
 For me, I'm still ramping up to internal services of the company, company culture, and ramping up to the tech stack. I am trying to learn as much as possible but am burning out because I'm constantly trying to learn and do at the same time in order to catch up but I feel like it's not working out for me. 
 Has anyone been in a similar situation as me? How can I know that I am meeting the bar as a senior engineer, especially when there is a mid-level engineer who join at the same time who is doing more work than I am?

 First there's the base question itself. Every resource I've looked at for system design seems to revolve around the same basic question format: design a system that does x, sometimes this is a self-contained thing and sometimes they use some existing website like Twitter or TinyURL as the example.

I find leetcode-esque problems to be far more engaging than the actual projects which I engage in, I know that it would be even worse in an actual work environment. I guess that I just don’t find a lot of programming in general to be fun, I find a lot of it to be a chore. I’ve been procrastinating coding something for a project, so that should tell you how I feel about it.

 Of course I have checked out https://github.com/go-graphics/go-gui-projects and I have visited the github page of each project to see their activity. Right now the best candidate is Fyne, but I'd like to read your opinion on this. What lib would you choose?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The stupid thing is basically a man in the middle attack intercepting all certificates and resigning them. This allows IT to inspect all traffic (note to self don't log into your bank on a work machine) which I guess they feel is necessary.
 But this also means that for development purposes the certs are broken all the time and you have to go install custom certs. Every dev at the company wastes half a day at least a couple times a year messing with this garbage.
 We've argued that it is a productivity drain and is miserable to no end. I guess this post is mostly a rant but has anybody had luck convincing IT leadership that launching a man in the middle attack on all internal network traffic is a bad idea?

 I found one example how it could be bypassed: struct { int a=0; char b='a'; } s;, but is there any overhead?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my head it's easy to comprehend it as just "address of (something)", but, for example, if I have int array[2]; and pretend it begins at 0x10 and I increment it like &array + 1, it'll give me 0x22 which is the end of the entire array, but if I do array + 1 it'll give me 0x14 which would be the next element of the array. So is this just the compiler interpreting pointer arithmetic in this way or does '&' actually mean something else?

 int add_one(const int val) { return val+1; }
 Versus
 void add_one(int &val) { val++; }
 I see the second one a lot around the code I work with and was wondering what advantage it has. In my opinion the first one is a lot more understandable. For example, if there's a function with like 6 arguments example_function(x, y, z, a, b, c) its impossible to know what variables are being modified without looking up the function definition. Versus if the function was val = example_function(x, y, z, a, b, c) then I know the output of that function is now in val. I'm not sure if this has a name or is debated but I need to know! 
 Thanks!

No properly engineered cache grows without bounds. There should be an upper size limit and a retention policy configured in pacman.conf. Then every time pacman adds something to the cache, it should check the size and policy, and discard as needed. The defaults should be reasonable, and you should be able to disable the whole thing if you want to manage it manually.

 I have applied via LinkedIn and Indeed to several positions. All types of positions for entry level and for internships. I graduated with a 3.7 GPA and really saw no hope in getting a call back as I dont have any major projects. As during school I work as a research assistant for Human in the loop ML and as a CS tutor. I did grind some leetcode.

 I have gotten okay at most problems that are not hard I can solve if it doesnt have a gimmick or trick. 
 I accepted the job offer at a local grocery store that has a small IT department. The pay is around 50K with full benefits of medical after 1 month of work. The job title is Systems Programmer. Honestly I am really relieved as 99% of the applications would just ghost me. I really didnt see myself getting any job related to coding. 
 The did 4 interviews in total. And the technical consisted of making a simple grocery store model with classes for customers, transactions, items and stores. I expected leetcode but it was much easier than I expected. There is still hope for getting a job.

 job 1: internship - unpaid - 4 months
 job 2: part time - $14/hr - 6 months
 job 3: full time - $55k/year - 1 year (current job)
 All of these jobs are software engineering roles, none of them are larger tech companies/FAANG
 I really want to make a substantial increase in my salary, and am willing to wait a longer amount of time to apply and keep trying to meet this salary since I am comfortable in my current job. My salary goal for my next job is something between $80k-$100k. When I brought this up with my mom, she said that this was probably unreasonable and that I should keep my expectations low, especially considering my pay in the past. I live in Texas, and have graduated from a top 50 cs university. How unreasonable is it to achieve this salary in this market? Am I setting my expectations too high?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 I am implementing a tree like data structure with a node base class and multiple derived classes. I am looking for a memory pool to allocate the various derived nodes with, but also properly destructs all the allocated nodes (as in via their destructors). For context, at some point in the program I want to destroy all the trees I have created hence why I think a memory pool would be a good way to deallocate all memory at once.
 Previously I naively used boost::pool<> and allocated the derived classes with it via new (pool.malloc()) ChildNode1 before realising the pool had no concept of the data it was storing so naturally their destructors were not called and data with additional allocations like vectors/strings were not being cleaned up.
 Next I looked at using boost::object_pool<Base> however that does not compile as the Base class is virtual.
 Looking for suggestions on how this might be achieved (with or without libraries). I'm aware that I could use a std::map<std::unique_ptr<Base>> and just grab the raw point to the node, but I would like the nodes to be allocated within blocks.
 Thanks.

 I need to implement a feature where the music instruments will fade out / in based on the player current performance. Lets say, if player is with a bad rank through the dungeon, only percussion will be played.
 Whenever he/she keeps combos without being hit, the ranking would be progressively incraese up to a maximum, where all instruments would be playing.
 So, i'm already stripping instruments from current musics into individual sound files with an AI app named Moises - it's extremely cheap.
 Now I need a way to implement the playback of all these individual instruments at perfect timming, and having control of their volume, panning and changing music on the fly.
 The game uses Direct Sound to play music, but I can't deal with Microsoft Win32 nor DSound code. I need suggestions for audio libraries. The easiest / simpler, the best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yep. It's one of those "If it's too good to be true, it is" moments.
 It all started when I applied to jobs on job boards, much like anyone does. Then I got an email asking to confirm my interest in a position. I said yes, then got an ODT file (like a word doc) with interview question and answers. Nothing too crazy, just regular interview questions (nothing asking for something too personal). I sent the email and got an email for a soft offer of $60/hr as a junior. I'm excited! It even comes with a stipend for a home office.
 After seeing inconsistencies between email signatures and a feeling of this being off, I call their HQ phone number. Yep, it's a scam. No one I've talked to works there.
 I had heard of a scam online where a company would send you a list of things to buy for your home office and send a check for the stipend. Then either the check would never come and you're stuck having bought so much equipment, or the check bounces. Also the fact that they require you to buy through their vendor also adds that they're stealing legitimate dollars.
 I'm not posting this to fearmonger, as I know much like everyone else here who's worked hard for the chance to get a job in software engineering & development they're doing everything to get a chance. Don't let yourself get taken advantage of.

We'll take a close look at their benchmark results to see how they perform in real-world scenarios.
  
 Overview of RabbitMQ and Kaleidoscope
 RabbitMQ is one of the most popular message brokers available. It implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and is renowned for its reliability, robustness, and extensive feature set, making it a staple in many production environments.
 Kaleidoscope, is a new AMQP-like message broker, written entirely in .NET 8.0. It is engineered to deliver high performance as it was designed to be the backbone of Phoesion Glow, a cloud backend service development and cluster…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody,
 I am working on a project where I created a test_convolver.cpp file, which includes convolver.h. The file convolver.h has the line #include "arm_math.h", and the file convolver.h is contained in libDaisy/Drivers/CMSIS/DSP/Include. This is included in my INCDIRS, which I then add to my CXX and C flags:
 CXXFLAGS += $(INCDIRS) CFLAGS += $(INCDIRS) 
 However, when I run my Makefile with target test_convolver.cpp, I get the error: 
 fatal error: 'arm_math.h' file not found.
 Interestingly enough, I do not get this error again when I include arm_math.h in test_convolver.cpp, only the original error from convolver.h. Does anybody know why this is? Why are the include directories fine for test_convolver.cpp, but not for convolver.h? Here is a possibly helpful part of my Makefile:
 TEST_SRC := app/engine/test_convolver.cpp TEST_TARGET := $(BUILD_DIR)/test_convolver.out TEST_OBJ := $(BUILD_DIR)/$(notdir $(TEST_SRC:.cpp=.o)) $(TEST_OBJ): $(TEST_SRC) | $(BUILD_DIR) mkdir -p $(@D) $(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CPP_STANDARD) -c $< -o $@ -MD -MP -MF $(BUILD_DIR)/$(notdir $(<:.cpp=.dep)) $(TEST_TARGET): $(TEST_OBJ) mkdir -p $(@D) $(CXX) -o $@ $^ $(LDFLAGS) $(LIBS) .PHONY: test test: $(TEST_TARGET) @echo "Test built: $(TEST_TARGET)"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Rustaceans
 I have been learning Rust and coming from Java I have to say it has been very refreshing.
 I just love the heavy use of sum types (enums) throughout the language, especially `Option` and `Result` that are far better than `null`s and exceptions. I like matching, I like macro that can sometimes feel like magic and others compile time control, I like that everything is immutable by default. The borrow checker forces me to understand the memory well which gives me a lot more confidence when mutating something (in Java, you don't own the object, and you don't know if some other part of the program holds a reference to it, so you're not very sure what part of the program would be affected by the mutation)
 However it seems to me that all the things that I love are the high level part of the language and the inspiration it took from functional programming.
 Sure I appreciate the language is very fast and that the same language can be used on bare metal, but it is not very useful to me, it never was a grievance to Java for me after all. The borrow checker can sometimes be annoying and although a high level language, it sometimes forces me to have low level considerations.
 The low level part although useful and interesting, is not very relevant to me, and I wonder what I could trade against this part of the language. In other words what could a high level only Rust look like? Could you make any suggestions of languages that can fit this description? I am thinking something with no nulls or exceptions, statically typed, with some emphasis on function purity, with algebraic data types and reasonably fast (something competitive to Java)
 I am thinking something like gleam, haskell or elm maybe but I would like to hear your thoughts and if you would take the trade-off.
 Thank you for reading me

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: Solved... Thanks everyone I got some validation that what I was thinking is not so strange, and I think I know how to write that wrapper now :) Appreciated. 
 I'm making a program that splits a file into n pieces and then merges them in which hopefuly the resulting file will be the exact same as original file.
 So far I can
  
Read the input file
 Split into n pieces
 Write pieces out as files.
  
For this I'm using a few mallocs. For which I have to do error checking , something like if `ptr== NULL`, return
 void allocCheck(void *ptr){ if(ptr == NULL){ fprintf(stderr, "Error allocating memory\n"); _exit(-1); } } int main(int argc, char *argv[argc + 1]){ char *buf; int itemsRead; int *pieceSize; char **paths; int nSplit = 20; // Number of splits, hardcoded for now. //Dinamic allocation. buf = malloc(sizeof(char) * MAX_FILE_SIZE); allocCheck(buf); pieceSize = malloc(sizeof(int) * nSplit); allocCheck(pieceSize); paths = malloc(sizeof(char *) * nSplit); allocCheck(paths); for(size_t i = 0; i < nSplit; i++){ paths[i] = malloc(sizeof(char) * MAX_PATH_SIZE); allocCheck(paths[i]); } //program function. itemsRead = readFile(PATH, buf); split(nSplit, itemsRead, pieceSize, paths); for(size_t i = 0; i < nSplit; i++){ writeFile(buf, paths[i], pieceSize[i]); } //freeing allocations free(buf); free(pieceSize); for(size_t i = 0; i < nSplit; i++){ free(paths[i]); } free(paths); return EXIT_SUCCESS; } 
 I made this function for error checking on allocations, to avoid extra clutter as I want my main function to be as clean as possible.
  
Is this even a good practice?
 Is it posible to do the mallocs on its own .c file? I wanted to do something like mem.c and mem.h and just move all that into its own file. Including the Null check.
  
perhaps something like a wrapper `myalloc( void *pointer, size_t size)` But I don't think is right using *void... and I do need to specify the type of pointer I'll be allocating.
 How would you do it?

However, I often find trying to use all features from these apps, which can be overwhelming, or using them for all sorts of things and they end up cluttered. And I forget that notebooks exist.
 What I needed was something fast and accessible—something I could pop up, jot down a few tasks, and have it available like a sticky note. I didn’t conduct an exhaustive search, but I ended up making a 'solution' for myself. I've been using it consistently, and maybe it will be helpful for others too.
 Check out the README! It includes download and installation information, with binaries available for Windows, Mac, and Linux in the releases section.
 Any comments or contributions are welcome ;)

 I should have used this to plan the post so I would not forget the link xd, anyway here is it. Also, a warning note, this was a 1-day thingy so expect a BARE MINIMUM "style". Which is a pro for me anyways.

 How do I start coding? How to make a good resume? How to get internships/jobs? Etc
 So I’m making something, just for you. No matter your skill level, I think you’ll find it helpful.
 I’m making a guide on everything that worked for me in my CS journey, which is still ongoing but I’ve gained decent amount of success and thought I would share.
 You really thought I was trying to sell you a course right? NOPE!!! I hate that. Information should be free. So this guide will be 100% free.
 I’m still in the process of making it, but there’s a picture to show you how it will look.
 I need your help to make this a solid guide.
 I want y’all’s thoughts on what else I might add to it before launch, questions you have (to add to the FAQ or in general), and any concerns you may have. 
 I’m really excited for this because instead of just telling people what to do, now we can all simply just say what to do AND link them how to do it.
 Thanks everyone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to learn how to parse mathematical expressions to make a ClI based advanced calculator later on (something similar to mathway). The program runs, but I wan't to be able to enter the expression with or without spaces. Right now I'm using getline to get the expression from the user and then stringstream ss(expression) to parse the expression so I can get the operands and operators. I sotre operators as a char in stack a, and operands as a double in stack b. Then a switch function to do the math.
  double applyOp(double a, double b, char op) { switch (op) { case '+': return a + b; case '-': return a - b; case '*': return a * b; case '/': return a / b; case '^': return pow(a, b); default: return 0; }  Currently I have to enter the expression as: 4 * ( 3 + 21 ); instead of: 4*(3+ 21). Another thing is this makes working with negative numbers slightly more difficult. I cannot enter: 3 * - 2 (no matter how I space it). Instead I have to enter any negative number as ( 0 - 2 ), which as you can imagine is very tedious. I want to be able to distinguish the numbers based on if there is an operator between them. Any suggestions are welcome.
 Also side note, for formatting code I only know of the ``` method, but I've heard it doesn't work for all versions of reddit. What methods work for all versions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are having a discussion regarding some code that looks like this:
 ``` public sealed class ApplicationServiceA { private readonly IEnumerable<IEntity> _entities; private readonly IConsumer _consumer;
 public ApplicationServiceA(IEnumerable<IEntity> entities, IConsumer consumer) { _entities = entities; _consumer = consumer; } public void SendEntitiesToConsumer() { foreach(var entity in _entities) { _consumer.Send(entity) } } 
 }
 public sealed class ApplicationServiceB { private readonly IEnumerable<IEntity> _entities;
 public ApplicationServiceB(IEnumerable<IEntity> entities) { _entities = entities; } public void SendEntitiesToConsumer(IConsumer consumer) { foreach(var entity in _entities) { consumer.Send(entity) } } 
 } ```
 Currently, it is implemented similar to ApplicationServiceB where the consumer is NOT injected via DI, but is passed in the SendEntitiesToConsumer() method as an argument.
 The question is if this methodology has a commonly accepted pattern name, and if it is considered acceptable/good to do it like this, or if we should convert the code to be similar to ApplicationServiceA where the consumer is injected via DI.
 My rational for keeping the current implementation is that it breaks the dependency (for better or worse?) I think I have seen this before under various guises such as "tell don't ask" or "pure functions", but I can't find any consise examples or discussions.

 I have built a small project to practice and improve my C++ skills. The project is called markov_text and it can construct a higher-order Markov chain based on a large text file (a corpus, for example) and then generate random text based on the chain. The constructed chain is saved as four files which the text-generator part of the program uses for fast lookups into the chain's values and other fields.
 I would very much appreciate your feedback regarding the code, usage of C++ standards/STL, and project structure.
 Here is the GitHub repository: https://github.com/AzeezDa/markov_text
 Thank you all in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to read a whole file's bytes into memory; for now, I'm doing nothing with it. Reading the file with FileInfo.OpenRead combined with a StreamReader is going very slowly; about 30 seconds as opposed to only 4 seconds to copy/paste the file from one hard drive to another in Explorer. Why would it be so slow to read it into memory? The example code:
 namespace ConsoleApp1 { internal class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { string multiGigFile = @"path\to\my\4gb\file"; FileInfo fi = new(multiGigFile); using (StreamReader sr = new(fi.OpenRead())) { int bufferSize = 104857600; // 100MB read buffer int bytesRead; char[] buffer = new char[bufferSize]; // Takes ~30 secs to finish the while loop, ~4s to copy from one hard drive to another while ((bytesRead = sr.Read(buffer, 0, bufferSize)) > 0) { Console.WriteLine($"File read; read next {bytesRead} bytes..."); } Console.WriteLine($"File read; finished."); } } } }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, so I'm in the pretty early stages of teaching myself web development for a personal creative project, and frankly it's been kind of slow putting the pieces together! I'm old and I got time so my progress is pretty slow. All I want to do eventually is post bloggy type things involving photos, doodles, and some music-y things I'm making. I'm learning completely solo so I don't have classmates to rant to!
 I've ruled out that I need python for now, but I've settled on Internetting is Hard and W3Schools for html/css education. On my own account I tried to download Jekyll because it sounded like it'd be helpful, and it may be, but it got me more familiar with 1) the Terminal, 2) VSCode, 3) Ruby, and 4) Homebrew and all of those things were terrifying to me before. Jekyll is enabling me to kind of see results of learning/tinkering a little faster than what I was doing before.
 Installing Jekyll through Terminal via Homebrew was such a cool learning experience.
 So why am I saying this is kind of a superpower? I'm also learning markdown elsewhere because certain programs like Notenik, Spaces, or Logseq use them, and it's a pretty nifty thing. Those types of programs are just helping me write better notes.
 And it hit me that ALL OF THIS IS JUST TEXT (duh that's what HTML is dude!) and it's just kind of amazing to me that you can build a whole valuable website and automate all sorts of things just by writing stuff out and placing it in the right spots. And the fact that it's just text files means it's super shareable, savable, and open. It's wild.
 Here and in other subreddits folks have been so helpful so I just wanted to write this out, if only for an affirmation. By the end of the summer I'll have a tiny simple stupid website that matches my vision and in April it literally seemed impossible.
 edit:
 this is awesome

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know all tech is constant learning, but there are certain paths that are more stable and don’t require coding to become an obsession. I am coming up on 2.5 yrs of experience as a mostly backend software dev. I am finishing my degree now and tbh I am not too excited about picking up all these new frameworks to stay competitive. Coding and tech is cool but I’m not in love with it. Are there certs or paths that I could take that would be a little more stable with the tech and that would maintain my salary of approximately $150k?
 Update: I do have some data analytic and sys admin experience which are more stable but the pay is significantly lower than where I am now.
 Update 2: I am well aware, as many have pointed out, that every job requires you to constantly learn. Not every job however requires you to reinvent your core skills every 5-10 yrs (JavaScript to Angular to React for example) nor does every job have intense panel technical interviews that one must practice for consistently. Data analyst positions (what u was before software developers) have to learn things but their core skills of sql and tableau are not going anywhere. The interviews are straight forward technical but not panel technical exams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least 60% of what I do on a day-to-day basis is what I would consider fake work. Meetings that accomplish nothing. Meetings to update me on org changes that have nothing to do with me. Copying data from dashboards into spreadsheets, building decks for meetings that will eventually be rescheduled (aka never happen), spending weeks campaigning for a change with a VP who will unexpectedly leave the company, endless trainings that don't apply to my job. 
 I am positive that 100% of the projects I am currently involved with will amount to nothing, and exist solely because a director is trying to get promoted. 
 My fellow managers are so fake and there is so much toxic positivity. I can't tell if these people are cutthroat corporate ladder climbers or if they are truly drunk on the company cool aide. It seems completely obvious to me that everything we do adds no value, but everyone else either fails to recognize this or turns a blind eye out of self-preservation. 
 I would go back to being an engineer, but I'm getting a bit older now and also I fear I've lost all my real, actual skills over the past few years. Not sure what to do. Is this what management is really like? Does this sound typical or am I at a particularly dysfunctional organization? Does anyone have experience with this? 
 Thanks.

I have an image that supposedly has a hidden message. I've tried using exiftool, strings, DiiT, /stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/, http://futureboy.us/stegano/, steghide, stegcracker (i currently have a python script running as I'm trying to brute force the passphrase since we weren't given one), and I just dont know where to go from here. I don't think I'm able to attach the actual image file here (or I'm just too sleep deprived to see it which is the most likely case). You guys were a massive help with the password cracking and I'm appreciate some more advice on this part of my assignment. Also incase your wondering I've asked my teacher for help multi times and her answer is always "Google it because thats all I'm going to do" just to give you some sort of idea as to what I'm working with, calling her a teacher is frankly far too generous.

 IBaseRepository is base of all repository interfaces, and implementation repositories are only implementing appropriate interface, for example:
 // ISkillRepository implementing IBaseRepository, SkillRepository is implementing ISkillRepository: IBaseRepository -> ISkillRepository -> SkillRepository // ICompanyRepository implementing IBaseRepository, CompanyRepository is implementing ICompanyRepository: IBaseRepository -> ICompanyRepository -> CompanyRepository 
 now im one by one registering all of this interfaces like this:
 services.AddScoped<SkillRepository, SkillRepository>(); services.AddScoped<ICompanyRepository, CompanyRepository>(); 
 but i want to make this process in automatic way. I tried many things to automate, but i cant. My code right now is (but not working):
 var repositoryTypes = Assembly .GetAssembly(typeof(PersistenceAssemblyPointer)) .GetTypes() .Where(type => !type.IsAbstract && !type.IsInterface && type.GetInterfaces().Any(x => x.IsGenericType && x.GetGenericTypeDefinition() == typeof(IBaseRepository<>))); var nonBaseRepos = repositoryTypes.Where(t => t != typeof(BaseRepository<,>)); foreach (var repositoryType in nonBaseRepos) { var interfeysler = repositoryType.GetInterfaces() .Where(interfeys => interfeys.IsGenericType && interfeys.GetGenericTypeDefinition() == typeof(IBaseRepository<>)) .ToList(); //if (interfeysler.Count != 1) //{ // throw new InvalidOperationException($"Repository '{repositoryType.Name}' must implement only one interface that implements IRepositoryBase<T>."); //} services.AddScoped(interfeysler[0], repositoryType); } 
 can someone please help me to automate service registering?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, today i found really interesting repository, 
 Chainski/Terminator: Terminator is a compact utility coded in C#, designed to end processes that have RtlSetProcessIsCritical enabled. (github.com)
 How it Works ?
 Terminator defines a method called UnProtectAndTerminate that aims to terminate a specified process after removing its protection. It utilizes platform invoke to call functions from system DLLs. First, it imports functions from ntdll.dll and kernel32.dll. These functions are NtSetInformationProcess to alter process information and TerminateProcess to forcibly terminate a process. Within the UnProtectAndTerminate method, it enters debug mode using Process.EnterDebugMode(). Then it attempts to open the target process using OpenProcess, passing necessary parameters including the process ID. Afterward, it calls NtSetInformationProcess with appropriate arguments to remove the process protection. If successful, it terminates the process using TerminateProcess with an exit code of 0. 
 Why was this tool made ?
 I developed this tool specifically designed to terminate processes containing the RtlSetProcessIsCritical feature, after encountering several malware samples utilizing this technique during my analysis.

 Thanks in advance for your help. Any suggestions are appreciated!
 I have a library in C# that is full of static methods, and I expose it as an API. None of the methods or classes use any specific C# features, so I'm considering converting it to a TypeScript library. The reason is that everything is very simple, and I want to avoid making API calls for simple calculations.
 However, this library will still be used by other C# projects, so I need to maintain it in C# as well.
 My questions are:
  
Is it possible to automatically convert all these static methods, classes, and DTOs into TypeScript?
 If not, is there a tool that can help with this conversion?
  
I'm currently following a Bridge.NET fork (https://github.com/curiosity-ai/h5) but i don't get how it work and have other tools that i want to explore.
 Thanks again for your input!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw this comment on YouTube regarding the performance cost of virtual methods in object-oriented languages, and designing extensible APIs in C:
  
Function pointers in a vtable structure. Which makes the call complicated for the compiler to optimize and then continues to make the processors job harder, by making it more likely to mis-predict the function call and thus waste cycles restarting the pipeline. Restarting the pipeline can take 5 to 15 cycles. A modern processor executes about 2 instructions per cycle. If you need to interface two pieces of code together that are not developed at the same time by the same people, use a header file. Let the compiler and linker collapse the abstraction away, so the processor isn't bothered by extra work and an unpredictable workload.
  
My question is what does this look like in practice? What is a simple example showing how one header file can extend the functionality of another header file similar to virtual methods in a language like Java? And is this technique more than just function pointers?

 For the original application I used Reddis and such to set up a que with threads. But this had the problem that my apllication at the time had multiple docker containers and therefore it was not possible to migrate the application to Azure. This had the problem, i we could not push the application to Azure. So I need some C# suggestions for a managing ques.
 Speaking of platforms I am looking for host platform where I can host my API,NET Api with the necessary security for free. Or at least with a low cost as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I learn std::is_constant_evaluated concept from learncpp website. The website mentions the compiler may also choose to evaluate a constexpr function at compile-time in a context that does not require a constant expression. So, I try to practice that with std::is_constant_evaluated whether the contexpr function will be evaluated at compile time when it does not require a constant expression or not. Just for curious.
 Here is my code
 ```cpp
 include <type_traits>
 include <iostream>
 constexpr int compute(int x) { if (std::is_constant_evaluated()) { return x * x; // Compile-time branch } else { return x + x; // Runtime branch } }
 int main() { int result {compute(5)}; std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl; return 0; } ```
 I noticed that the website said gcc with -O2 compiler option will evaluate a constexpr function which isn't required constant expression at compile time. So I use the -O2 option to make the compiler evaluate.
 I expected that the result would be 25 when the constexpr function was evaluated at compile time. However, it returns 10. Obviously, this function was evaluated at runtime. I don't know why this happens. Is there anything I miss or misunderstand?

 I can work autonomously, I am happy to help more junior engineers with some of best practices that I have learned either by myself or from other devs.
 I am more of a data science guy who transitioned into data engineering. I know I lack understanding of system design because usually I tend to work on a small part of a system.
 Given that I work for a consulting company, I never spend enough time on a project to learn how my decisions (or other decisions) impact in the long run. Often things I do feel hacky.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two corrupted video files. One file is mp4, the other is mkv, both contained the same video and audio data before corruption. I also have a file checksum for the correct version of the mp4 file, which is corrupted in only one place (a block of data containing 8192 bytes). I would like to complete this data using the correct data for this moment which still exists in the mkv file.
 I have already extracted the necessary video/audio data from the mkv. From what I see, the audio in the mp4 is inserted in blocks without any additional data, but unfortunately the video blocks are preceded by some preliminary data that I will have to recreate somehow. This is probably some data resulting from the structure of the mp4 file, but I will have to look for this information.
 Is there a free hex editor that will allow me to visually separate these video/audio blocks while I work? For example, so that I can mark and then find their beginnings and ends and easily jump between them, or to easily compare the contents of two shorter blocks that are not next to each other in the data sequence.
 Currently, I use the HxD editor, but here I work with the one block of entire data, without any visual selection options, which is why I often get lost in it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Company is planning on getting CI but us developers lack prior experience with CI tools. We deal with higly confidential data and have a complex server architecture where some test environments can be accessed only through ssh from certain servers.
 Recuirements: On premises. Podman compability. Can send commands to a server through another server.
 Bonus: Mercurial support (we are considering migration to git) Easy to learn, use and maintain. RobotFramework and/or PyTest support. Not too expensive.
 We have been considering Jenkins or TeamCity and confirmed that both pass the requirements. While Jenkins is old & clunky and atm its mercurial plugin isn't actively maintained, it is free, unlike TeamCity which would ramp up in cost quickly since we'd need agents for all of our test servers.
 A quick look through this sub gave me the impression that you love GitLab CI. Would it be able to ssh podman containers that run RFW tests and then show the results in UI?
 Which CI tool would be the best option for our company?

 I'm working on some exercises for my upcoming exams and had chatGPT write me a program since I couldn't write it myself efficiently. The problem is, I can't understand how it works and I spent the whole day trying. The exercise asked to write a program in C that finds flawless' squares. That is, numbers whose digits (all digits MUST be used), when summed and squared, give the number itself. For example, 81 is flawless square since (8+1)^2 = 81 and 1296 since (1+29+6)^2 = (36)^2 = 1296. The tricky part is that it's digits can combine but not freely (for example 196 + 2 is not an acceptable combination of "1296" digits). I tried writing a program myself which ended up being a mess because many variables were needed and also it was very slow since the exercise's input is the ran…]]></summary>

 This june, there are close to 2000 games in Next Fest. Last year, there were around 1000. It's not just because there are more games released each year, it's also because of a new Steam appeal system. Before this system, you needed to register in February to be able to participate in June. Now, you can pretty much decide to participate whenever you want and you'll most likely be accepted.
 But there is more to that, and it's far more concerning. Some popular games gets to participate twice while Steam says it's ONE Next Fest (ever).
 I'll take the example of Aloft, a game currently taking of the top slots of Next Fest.
 Well, guess what? Aloft was already participating in June 2022 edition! Here is proof:

 I have organized my objects into separate libraries, for example AbcCrm.Customers, or AbcCrm.Warehouse.
 In them I have all the related objects (for example Customer, Address) and a static class called Methods.cs, which contains the CRUD methods.
 My naming convention for these are:
 GetCustomers(), GetAddresses() for recieving data from SQL
 Customer_Add(Customer c), Customer_Edit(), Customer_UpdateHistory(), Address_Add(), etc. - for all the other operations.
 Some people told me that I shouldn't use underscores in names because C# uses PascalCase, but I think that those make my code easier to understand. Even Visual Studio generates underscores when using events on buttons in for example WinForms!
 So who's right? Thanks in advance :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A friend is learning ASP.NET and needed a clarification from the book "ASP.NET Core in action" by Andrew Lock. At page 211, the author recommends not to resolve scoped or transient services directly from the root DI container, because can lead to "leaking of memory".
  
WARNING Don’t resolve scoped or transient services directly from WebApplication.Services.
 This approach can lead to leaking of memory, as the objects are kept alive till the app exits and aren’t garbage-collected.
  
But for scoped services, you cannot resolve a scoped service without having a scope, you need to create a scope first! And even if you forget to dispose the scope, it will eventually go garbage collected and disposed. How can a memory leak be produced?
 For transient services, you cannot have a memory leak, because that's how transient services work, an instance is created every time, the container does not keep an instance to it.
 Next, another recommendation which is confusing:
  
Instead, you should only resolve scoped and transient services from an active scope.
  
Always resolve transient services from an active scope!? What does scope have to do with transient services?
 Although I am senior engineer myself, I wanted to ask a clarification further, here that's why I posted it here.
 DISCLAIMER: My goal here is not to try call out the book or the author in any way!!! To be clear, I have not read the book, but the book seems very nice, it has very nice and useful diagrams, it's just that this specific part is weird, at least to me.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're a small company (about 10 people) in Australia and recently our general manager was approached by Oracle to switch to using their cloud away from AWS.
 So far they've promised that it would be cheaper, more secure and that we will get brand contact with other companies using Oracle.
 I've had a bit of a hard time finding good information to verify these claims. I can see from their website that it might indeed be cheaper, but hard to know if there's any other hidden fees. As for more secure I also couldn't find much info that wasn't from Oracle themselves. Plus we're not using a DB, we mostly use EC2, S3, a VPC and load balancer from AWS.
 As for company connections, do companies really connect over the backend servers they use?
 I'm trying not to be too negative, but I'm struggling not to think that my manager was just given the sales pitch for something that will at best be the same but with a different company.
 Edit: Thanks for all the replies, I’m definitely going to have another meeting and if the manager is too far gone then that’s a big red flag (more than what’s already happened).

 I have an issue with an API in Business Central. I want to query an API using C#. The program is written in the .Net Maui Framework, which is used for cross-platform apps. When the code is executed on Windows, I get the correct response from the API, and everything works fine. However, I always receive a 401 Unauthorized response when the app is run on Android. The same (401 Unauthorized) response occurs when I try to call it with Postman or Insomnia.
 I use web services with the OData V4 URL for the queries, and the username is used for authentication in BC. What puzzles me is that the query works perfectly in the browser but is unsuccessful in all other methods. I suspect that Business Central is not configured correctly or there might be a problem with .Net Maui.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love this community, and thought to consult with you guys.
 I've been working on an app, which ended up pretty neat. I learned a lot through the process. I thought about writing a practical book/course of the things I learned, and build the app with the readers together.
 I've been developing in Go for about 5 years now; and in the software industry for 10+. Question is, do you think people look for such content? I see many posts here asking for good recommendations to learn Go. 
 What I have in mind is not to teach Go, but rather take people who write Go code to the next level. Build a real project (not dummy, or clone of something else), which end up with an web-app you can use (I don't mind sharing the code, since I don't make any money of it - it's totally free). On the way I walk through the software design decisions, requirements, few principles, shipping to production, etc. Starting from blank, to a real project - one that you can be proud of at job interviews.
 Do you think is it something people might be interested in? Obviously it won't be free, because that's a ton of work, but since I'm a firm believer of free education (as much as possible) this won't be expensive. Or am I better not waste my time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 Currently im during a process of developing an packer/protector for binary executables. Mainly for my self at the moment, but Im considering if there would be market for the solution. My solution would be an desktop GUI app, as well as shipped with CLI available binary (for servers aka CI/CD).
 The protector would work as follows:
  
Load your binary into the protector.
 Select the protection mechanisms out of available in the protector GUI.
 Optionally save protection presets for future use, or for CLI use as well.
 Export protected binary
  
The protection features would be:
  
Anti-debuggers protection
 Strings obfuscations
 Import obfuscations
 Code flow / disassembly obfuscations
 Anti-VM protection
 On the fly License Manager (create/modify a user licensed by EMAIL + KEY or HWID)
 Binary size compression
  
The protector itself would be fully cross-platform solution. Meaning that the GUI and CLI tool could run the same way on Windows, Linux and MacOS machines. So the Linux host can manage Windows, MacOS and Linux binaries and vice-versa.
 At the beginning I would support only Windows binary protection, meaning that the protection of Windows EXE and DLL only would be available at the beggining. No Linux ELF executables, and no MacOS Mach-Os - those would be added in the future.
 The protector will make your binary nearly impossible to crack or even nearly impossible to investigate whats inside (lets assume that you don't want anyone to see how the communication with your remote backend server is done on the client side, as an example).
 Does anyone would be interested of using such soft? If no please tell why. Are you using any solution that is currently available on the market? If yes, please tell me what can be done better.
 Thanks

 I used to think he didn't trust me because I'm not as experienced as the rest of my team, but he's like that with everyone.
 He's pretty technical actually, but he also seems to think he can make sound decisions from a high-level view, and it's up to us devs to argue him out of it. I can't remember the last time I've changed his mind on anything. He's not abrasive or anything, but it's often a choice between:
  
Wasting time having to explain low-level details for up to an hour in standups
 Telling him to leave this decision-making to us
 Going with what he says and letting issues come up later.
 Not bringing up some details and taking care of them yourself.
  
I've somewhat accepted this. What I want to know is if this is common in the industry? Or if it's just me?

I started learning swift since Feb and it's been on and off but the last 2 months l've been getting better at staying consistent, so a person I know wants an app for their private gym and I have been honest with them about my lack of experience but not completely to the point that I've never made a app before. I gave them a turn around time for about 5-6 months to make.
 I was thinking that I would use one month to just focus on all that l lack in my knowledge and use the rest to start developing the app and use Google as my best friend. My thought behind it was "there is no way better to keep me committed and motivated than working on someone else's app and get paid for it, especially with the pressure"
 Do you think this would be possible to do as a novice or have I bitten more than I can chew?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always wanted to contribute something to the open source community. This is a pretty small fun project if you want to get your feet wet with networking. It's a Multiplayer Flappy bird game (just rectangles) written purely in C using Raylib and LibUV. The client sends inputs to the server which sends back gamestates at a fixed interval. The gamestates are rendered with a 100ms render delay to allow packets from the server to arrive (keeping gameplay consistently smooth). It does not have any client side prediction but it is a very simple design for getting into multiplayer game development. The core of the code is contained in two files (server.c and client.c). Gameloop has collision detection, response, very basic physics, map collision loading and rendering.
 If you'd like to test it by yourself , change kMaxNumberOfPlayers in gameshared.h to 1 and launch server then client.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in over my head at my current software job of 10 years. Some of the problems are almost too difficult for me to solve at all. I can't really delegate to anyone because all of the capable engineers left my team since they're sick of working with me. The junior engineers regularly message my manager because I can't fix their problems and it's hurting their ticket completion rates. I've received scathing rebukes from colleagues calling me lazy and unqualified ever since college, even though I did the work and graduated with a master's in CS from a state school with a 3.7 GPA.
 The final nail in the coffin was when I was rebuked by a colleague today for not completing an extensive performance test, which is a criteria for releasing a much-needed feature. I had a lot of higher priorities including company-wide shipblockers to fix, yet millions of dollars are on the line. In my opinion releasing a slow feature is the best we can do at this point anyways, but that's not enough.
 The fact is that I will emerge into a job market with NO references, and the company will report me as No Rehire when prospective employers do reference checks. It's the only job I've had since college.
 I'm not looking for validation, and I've been working on my flaws. Yet when expectations go up faster than I can fix my flaws, it's frankly time to go. I'm looking for advice on the best way to leave and what to move on to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something that's frustrated me for a while is how many store pages for a game on steam will have one or two cinematic trailers and then ten screenshots of environment art without even any UI. Especially in certain genres like action rpgs for example, I want to see the skill tree, what classes are available, their abilities, cool effects on weapons and equipment, but instead of dedicating even a single screenshot to one of the game's systems, it's only art.
 Are studios afraid of pushing away players who might be intimidated by these things? And if so why cater to the people who are more likely to refund and write a bad review once they realize they don't like the systems that were kept hidden from them rather than fans of their game's genre who would actually enjoy the systems if they knew about them? There are so many games I skip by that could be perfect for me but I don't want to spend time doing extra research and looking through a gameplay vid on youtube.
 Edit: I do recognize skill trees were a bad example and the complexity there could turn players away, but I am more referring to showing any core system the game has to offer beyond art style and cinematography

 OS: Ubuntu 22.04
 QuickFAST: 1.5
 BOOST: 1.85.0
 Xerces-C: 3.2.5
 MPC: 4.1.46
 I followed these steps:
 $ mkdir ~/quickfast
 $ mv xerces-c*.tar.gz boost_*.tar.gz MPC*.tar.gz quickfast*.tar.gz ~/quickfast
 Unpack the sources
 $ cd ~/quickfast
 $ tar -xvzf *.tar.gz
 $ rm -rf ./*.tar.gz
 Compile Xerces-c:
 $ cd ~/quickfast/xerces-c-3.2.5
 $ ./configure && make
 Compile Boost
 $ cd ~/quickfast/boost_1_62_0
 $ ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr/local/lib
 $./b2 --layout=versioned
 $./b2 install
 Edit ~/quickfast/quickfast-1_5/setup.sh:
 export QUICKFAST_ROOT=`pwd` export MPC_ROOT=~/quickfast/MPC-MPC_4_1_46/ export BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local/lib export BOOST_CFG= export BOOST_ROOT_LIB=/usr/local/lib export BOOST_STATIC_LIB_PREFIX= export BOOST_VERSION=boost-1_62_0 export BOOST_TEST_CHECKPOINT= export XERCES_ROOT=~/quickfast/xerces-c-3.2.5 export XERCES_LIBPATH=$XERCES_ROOT/src/.libs export XERCES_LIBNAME=libxerces-c-3.2.5 export XERCES_INCLUDE=$XERCES_ROOT/src export PATH=$QUICKFAST_ROOT/bin:$MPC_ROOT:$PATH export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$XERCES_LIBPATH:$QUICKFAST_ROOT/lib:$BOOST_ROOT_LIB:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
 Apply variables to scope:
 $ . ./setup.sh
 Add execute permissions to file:
 $ chmod +x ~/quickfast/MPC-MPC_4_1_46/mwc.pl
 Generate Makefile:
 ./m.sh
 In ~/quickfast/quickfast-1_5/:
 make
 Here is where I get "error: invalid use of incomplete type ‘class boost::asio::io_service’"
 Does anybody know how I can fix this?

 [~]$ sudo ethtool enp12s0 Settings for enp12s0: Supported ports: [ TPMII ] Supported link modes: 10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full 100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full 1000baseT/Full 2500baseT/Full Supported pause frame use: Symmetric Receive-only Supports auto-negotiation: Yes Supported FEC modes: Not reported Advertised link modes: 10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full 100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full 1000baseT/Full 2500baseT/Full Advertised pause frame use: Symmetric Receive-only Advertised auto-negotiation: Yes Advertised FEC modes: Not reported Link partner advertised link modes: 10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full 100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full Link partner advertised pause frame use: Symmetric Receive-only Link partner advertised auto-negotiation: Yes Link partner advertised FEC modes: Not reported Speed: 100Mb/s Duplex: Full Auto-negotiation: on master-slave cfg: preferred slave master-slave status: slave Port: Twisted Pair PHYAD: 0 Transceiver: external MDI-X: Unknown Supports Wake-on: pumbg Wake-on: d Link detected: yes 
 Using
 sudo ethtool -s enp12s0 speed 1000 duplex full autoneg on
 would unlink the connection.
 Does anybody has a clue why this isn't working? Searched hours for a solution but I'm not finding anything useful

I tested it in VM after writing it. Take a read at the first part of the file before running it, as some things like your disk password, username, etc need to be set. It should be ran within an Arch Linux ISO.

 Just graduated this past May and took a job paying 65k, yet I still feel like I could’ve done better (maybe a syndrome of being on this sub) 
 I’m seeking advice on how to play my cards right. It is about a 45 minute commute each way, and I’m currently living with my parents.
 I have no general expenses (food/rent) as company provides lunch and parents provide dinner a lot of the time. 
 Should I focus on getting experience at this company and plan to job hop? I’m not sure if 65k as a new grad is too high. Also any advice on what to do with this excess money would be appreciated. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: Issue resolved. Solution in comments.
  
Hello,
 I've been daily driving Arch on my gaming desktop for the past month. It's been a pretty smooth experience so far, especially after the 555 drivers for nVidia were released. Wayland has been usable and very enjoyable.
 KDE Plasma 6
 SDDM
 nVidia Proprietary Drivers (555 beta drivers)
 I jumped on my desktop before leaving for work this morning and noticed in the system tray there were updates available. Opened up Discovery and installed the available updates. I quickly skimmed through the list and saw a few Mesa packages, and a bunch of KDE apps updating from 6.2 to 6.3.
 Installed the updates, everything completed. I rebooted my PC and it appeared to be booting up just fine. When the screen switched to what I would assume would have been the login screen it just went black instead. After a few seconds the UEFI logo for my motherboard was displayed on the screen again and nothing happens after this.
 I used CTRL+ALT+F3 to access the shell, rechecked pacman for updates, but didn't find any. System is fully updated. I tried another reboot, same result.
 I honestly didn't have a lot of time to poke around and troubleshoot as I had to run to work. I'll be heading home soon. Does anyone have any recommendations as to where to look to troubleshoot this or fix this?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wondering, after several trials, on several PCs...never managed to properly deploy Arch using the `archinstall` script, typically when trying to go through a manual partioning (or keep actual current partition scheme, only flagging couple of partitions for wipe/mounting points).
 When using the auto-partitioning, `archinstall` runs just fine though.... and - since I want/need to keep a specific partition scheme (my usual daily PC is a dual-boot Win11/Arch + common NTFS `/data` partition), I always end up doing the good old Arch deploy manual recipe, by-the-book.
 Not digging the cryptic error message (Python-like dump), maybe I should/could share the logs...
 I am not sure if this is a YouTuber-only approach and that this script is actually still very green (some might actually claim that you don't use Arch (btw) to avoid manual deployment...). 
 (I actually kind of like the simplicity of this script and I feel it fully (de)serves Arch community rewarding...)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know how to use ASP.NET Core in general, but I still have issues with how to design the exposed models for GET and PATCH requests when resources have nested properties that can also be updated.
 Should the get method expose the ids of the BookLauchAppointment or the employee?
 How can I update a BookLaunchAppointment.Location with a PATCH? Something I did so far was defining an update model and everything that is not null will be updated to a value. This only works for data that can't explicitly be set to null. JavaScript has undefined and null. An undefined value would mean, that a property should not be patched, but a null value means that a property should be set to null. Is there a better way?
 What alternative solutions are there for this?
 There is JsonPatch which is supported by ASP.NET Core but does not seem to be supported by open api code generators / not widely used in general.
 Example models
 public class Book { public int Id { get; set; } public string Title { get; set; } public Publisher Publisher { get; set; } public IEnumerable<BookLaunchAppointment> Appointments { get; set; } } /// <summary> /// Should not be exposed as own resource /// </summary> public class Publisher { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public string Address { get; set; } } /// <summary> /// Does not seem like a good resource on its own /// </summary> public class BookLaunchAppointment { public int Id { get; set; } public DateOnly Appointment { get; set; } public string? Location { get; set; } public IEnumerable<Employee> Employees { get; set; } } public class Employee { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } } [HttpGet(Name = "GetBooks")] public Task<IEnumerable<Book>> Get() { return .... } /// how should the publishers / appointments / employees be updated? // assume that BookLaunchAppointment: Employee m:n [HttpPost(Name = "UpdateBooks")] public void Update(...) { return .... }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 A long while back I shared a library that did some weird stuff and ultimately wasn't adhering to the strict aliasing rule. I have had a rethink and was wondering if the following simplified example would adhere to it. If so, this could be a route forward with my refactor.
 In short:
  
So long as a type is the first in a struct, a pointer to that struct can be casted to a pointer of that type and accessed.
 Any pointer type (minus func pointer) is compatible with void * (or char *) + qualifiers.
 Definitions of structures can differ in units, so long as the differing member types adhere to the above rules.
  
​
 #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> float **FloatArrayCreate() { struct Alloc { union { float *data; void *raw; } u; int size; }; struct Alloc *rtn = calloc(1, sizeof(*rtn)); rtn->size = 10; rtn->u.data = calloc(10, sizeof(*rtn->u.data)); rtn->u.data[2] = 9; /* * 1) Valid? First element is a float *. */ return (float **)rtn; } int ArrayLength(void *_data) { struct Alloc { union { void *raw; /* <-- There is no float * here. But 6.2.7 says char * is compatible */ } u; int size; }; /* * 2) Valid? Never accesses union. */ struct Alloc *data = _data; return data->size; } int main() { float **arr = FloatArrayCreate(); /* * 3) Valid? [0] accesses first element (float *), [2] access 3rd element of float *. */ printf("Size: %i %f\n", ArrayLength(arr), arr[0][2]); return 0; }

I've seen several voices speaking up about their issues describing indie titles in this way (obviously those games weren't entirely made by this few developers; marketplace assets used, contract dev's contributed, etc.) and it seems like it paints such an unrealistic picture of what can be done solely by one individual or two, respectively. Not to mention the pressure for single developers that is created with statements like this.
 Now, obviously, it can be done. Nowadays it takes only one person to bring it all together and create a new experience it seems. So should we not care about those statements at all?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an SDE1 at Amazon, hired just under 2 years ago. My team has absolutely exploded since then, we're now up to more than a dozen people divided almost evenly between NYC and Seattle. We've onboarded 4 new full time engineers in the last year, 2 of them within the past 2 months, which seems like a very aggressive rate of growth for a team that's already pretty sizeable. I have three theories:
  
The team is just unusually large, simple as.
 Management is planning to split the team up into two, one based out of NYC and the other in Seattle.
 We're bulking up in anticipation of some aggressive URA cuts.
  
Does anyone in big tech in general or Amazon in particular have experience with this kind of thing? What does it normally mean when a team seems to be growing insanely fast? Is this kind of growth rate or team size even that unusual?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for insight, people's own personal journeys, etc.
 I work for an infrastructure provider and stumbled into "DevOps". Day to day, I'm working on deploying physical/virtual infrastructure through automations and pipelines. In that sense, our Dev relationship is bridging the gap between our product team and our Operations teams.
 We've been a VMware shop for a long time, and so I don't have that adjacency to public cloud that I see in every job posting. AAP is the majority of my day, gitlab, building out automations in service now, using terraform in places, most of my automations center around provisioning networking(layer 2-3, BGP, etc), firewalls, hypervisors, storage, VMs. 
 It's been fun, but with the Broadcom acquisition, the money has been drying up, I've seen so many of my work family fired. I've been losing the war to inflation as my pay hasn't kept up with my increasing costs. I'm starting to think I need to find a new workplace. I'm afraid to even go through application cycles because I don't have AWS/Azure on my resume and you just don't see job postings that are akin to who we would hire.
 Do I hammer out a cloud cert? What should my approach be to navigating this issue of finding a new employer? It's been a fun 6 years, but I need a new start at a company with healthy financials that are hiring and not constantly downsizing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every time I have a problem, since starting with Arch Linux. It's always Arch wiki that gets me answers on pretty much 99% of things that are not even related to Arch itself. This is one of the best and most valuable pages on the Internet, at least for myself. If my Internet connection drops, I wish to still have access in an emergency.
 I figured you can download these locally using package arch-wiki-docs. Once you install the package. There are files located under /usr/share/doc/arch-wiki/html
 Now the question, what is correct way to access this content? Do we just open pages one by one in your web browser? Or can we host a local web server to serve the content, the same way like official wiki page.. or is there a command we can run that I am not aware of that will initialise pages for us and open it in a browser?
 /Edit
 I forgot to add I am interested in search box functionality

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Honestly it's my white whale. Finding the game of my dreams. I can't find it, been trying for years. It just doesn't exist.
 It's an obsession, literally. I crave a game so badly and yet what I want just doesn't exist, not even close.
 For example, this is the game I want: Every time I read a "litrpg" book, like those Korean novels/mangas with MMO elements, I imagine so many cool things in my head, I want a game like that.
 I want a 2D, top-down game with many many different systems. All kinds of things like alchemy, enchantments, rebirths etc... Just system after system. 
 A huge 2D RPG or roguelike that is huge, as big as Skyrim in content. With cities and dungeons, lots of things to do, many things to grind, things to collect. So many skills to level, stats to gain. 
 I don't even want good gameplay or graphics, just a whole bunch of messy systems even if they're unbalanced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've created an algorithm called "TrHash." The "TrHash Basic" version is really simple, yet hard to crack without proper context on how it works — or at least I think it is. That's what I want to put to the test. It doesn't use RSA, AES, etc.; as I said, it's simpler than you think.
 In TrHash Basic, you can only encrypt following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9.
 Any other characters won't be encrypted and will be kept the same.
 New line may break the decrypting proccess.
 Small hint: It's based of a Caesar cipher, but uses a specific way of decrypting messages with the keys.
 Here's the encrypt/decrypt page I've made:
 TrHash - Encrypt/Decrypt
 I wonder how long it'll take until someone figures it out, have fun :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was fortunate enough to get an offer senior year of college at one of the big banks and now I (almost) hate the job. I graduated April 2020 so it wasn’t hard to get a job then as it is now. My team is about 90% silos at or over retirement age so if they decide to leave this application is going to hell. I feel like your job should be where you learn and if you wanna go the extra mile (which I do) I do small local projects every now and then… My role is frontend UI related stuff and I’m basically given whatever instead of what I know. I always took it because I saw it as exposure and learning but now it’s not longer about learning the skill but keeping the application afloat ( I hope the makes sense). It’s all very niche to the team. This also does not happen to the other devs on my team, during the scrum their tasks are always consistent.
 Have you ever been given so many random tasks back to back that don’t correlate with each other so often that you can’t grasp the/any skill? 
 I feel this happening and I want to leave the company but as we all know jobs are hard to come by rn 
 (Yes I’ve talked to my manager and his now new manager about keeping consistent work but my request is overlooked)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just started on a new assignment. Nearly all of my experience has been with AWS but this new project is on-prem private cloud. Public cloud isn't an option for compliance reasons.
 The team I've just joined is wrangling about the container solution for the new platform. The user traffic they get is not that big. It is certain to increase as they scale up, although I couldn't say how much exactly. It doesn't feel like the stack is complex enough to go to K8s just yet. If it was AWS I would probably be pushing for ECS, because it's a good choice for small-to-medium scale workloads, it can go quite a long way before needing to migrate to K8S, and it's pretty straightforward to get going with.
 But this is the on-prem world which is all new to me. I'm not sure what ECS equivalents there are, or whether there even are any and maybe it's normal to just go to K8s. Plus I'm aware that thinking of 'equivalents' is perhaps not the right way to approach things, but it is just new territory that I'm trying navigate. They currently use Docker Swarm. I don't know much about it but some people I've spoken to have been quite derisive of it.
 Any input? Also curious to hear of experiences from anyone who switched from AWS/public cloud to on-prem, what challenges you found and what kind of things you had to get used to.
 Edit: When I say K8s I'm also including managed K8s services like Rancher and Openshift. If we do go with K8s I highly doubt we'll be doing it from scratch, that would be hellish.

 B is also abstract and extends A, but B does not want to implement m();
 B want it's child classes to implement it
 I know it's possible like below:
 B implements m like this:
 m() {
 n();
 }
 And n is an abstract method that B's children must implement. So then B satisfies A's method m(), but B doesn't need to provide the logic
 HOWEVER, I want m() to skip right down to B's children, if it's possible

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there!
 I'd like to announce that I published my first Rust crate a few weeks ago: lazy_errors. The main purpose of this crate is to allow you to defer handling individual Result::Errs and to group and nest arbitrary error types ergonomically, enabling you to return multiple error values from functions at the same time. Here's a link: https://crates.io/crates/lazy_errors
 I started learning Rust five years ago in my spare time. There is so much I love about the community and the ecosystem: The language is both nice to read and write, very expressive, and the community has documented extensively how to design good, idiomatic solutions. There are a lot of powerful crates that just feel natural. For example, thiserror and anyhow/eyre are just so fundamental to defining or handling errors …]]></summary>

 I am an DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer at a startup. I have automated most of our systems to the point where my daily workload has become lighter. This newfound free time has sparked my interest in expanding my horizons into contract, consulting, or freelance work to accompany my full time job. 
 I have tried networking and applying through job boards, but am finding it challenging to make headway in this area. I'm reaching out for advice or tips that could help me land something.
 My motivation for exploring these opportunities is twofold: I aim to diversify my income and to continue learning and growing within this field that I deeply enjoy. I am eager to take on more work and further contribute to the world of DevOps.
 I appreciate any insights or guidance you can provide. Thank you in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full disclosure, my game isn't in Next Fest, so I don't have a dog in the fight.
 Looking at Next Fest this month is kind of depressing. The original idea of the event was for people to discover new games they had never heard of before, but right now it seems to just be highlighting games that everyone already has on their wishlist.
 Just to name a few that Steam is pushing to the top for me right now:
  
Wizard of Legend 2 (~200k wishlists)
 Mirthwood (~200k wishlists)
 Tiny Glade (~1M wishlists?!)
 Tavern Talk (~100k wishlists)
  
Like is this an event to find new games or is this just a way to see the New & Trending tab a month early? I know there are still some sections on the Next Fest page where they randomly show games, but all the attention seems to be aimed at getting the popular games a couple more sales rather than lifting the smaller ones from obscurity.
 How are things faring for everyone in Next Fest? Am I off the mark? Are you still seeing growth despite all of these already popular games hogging the limelight?

I want to know whether it is worth my time to work for such a company, and whether I should take this test.

So in that spirit, what do you wish you'd known before going to work for big tech? I will be working for meta at L4, but all advice is appreciated.
 Some specific things I'm wondering
  
Is it time to start optimizing my performance for reviews? I usually come into new opportunities with guns blazing, but maybe I should hold back a bit to not set expectations so high?
 I would love to not job hop so much now (this will be my 4th job this year), so I'll instead focus on advancement. How does one advance in big tech? I hear a lot about playing politics, which I'm not opposed to. What does this entail?
 What will I be surprised by at Meta/big tech after a few YoE working in smaller tech companies and startups?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a web server that I'm running off of localhost:80, and I have it connected to Unity. My plan is to have Unity send different get requests for getting things like online levels, but I don't know how to specify parameters and to send/recieve data based on that stuff. 
 An example would be a GET request from localhost:80/getLevel or a POST request from localhost:80/uploadLevel, but I don't know how to make those valid URL's in my web server.
 Any help with this? If you need more specific goals / my code then I can share it in the comments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a little over 25 yoe. Got laid off as a tech lead in September and couldn't find a job after months of searching. Finally called in a favor and cowered back to a previous employer as an IC. I was fortunate to have that connection, and I know many others are not...
 I haven't had a problem finding work since the dot-com bust, even in a tough market, because I usually have people reaching out to me constantly and then I sail through the interviews. This time around, I couldn't even get an interview. I have a premium account on LinkedIn and I noticed they rank you by degree. I'm a child of the dot-com era so I don't have a degree.
 LinkedIn is the preferred job board for corporate gigs and it ranks you by degree. Between that and the proliferation of automated filters, I'm starting to think that I was just getting filtered out before a human ever saw anything. I assume there are just so many candidates, that a degree is commonly used to reduce the # of applicants.
 Given that this board has been pretty divided between "job market's terrible" and "you guys are overreacting", I wonder how many people here struggling to find work lack a degree?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Programmers, I am just starting to enter in the tech field after a degree in Computer Science which i am finishing next month, so i started looking for internships at every platform. And today i got one interview of Machine Learning Intern position at a place in eygpt where as i reside in India. I got into interview and it went really well i did have some experience/projects in python[Machine learning and Web development] to showcase so like the interviewer is impressed but at last he started telling me that "so this is a small company this internship will cost you $20[₹1700] for the mentorship we provide. You have to build and give them two projects in 1 month tenure" - exact words.
 So here i am confused about what to do, at first i thought it is a scam because though this was a unpaid internship i did sign up unwillingly but now they are want me to pay them. EDITED[Added] - 'And the second thought which comes in mind was this can be true because I don't about other countries but whenever I searched on LinkedIn and location in India for the internships there are number of internships which wants me to pay like $5[₹500-₹800]. They are just like distributing internships certificate and the tasks are like make a calculator. That's where i thought it can be real.'
 What are views on this should pay them and start or try another internship?
 Also if you can refer me some good internship, please show your kindness.

 I guess maybe we can start with “reliable”. Now a manager really loves a reliable developer. Meaning when the dev is given task the dev can usually deliver in a reasonable amount of time. Now I’ve worked around a lot of reliable software engineers in the past. And they are usually some of the worst developers producing some of the worst code I’ve ever seen. They are speedy but the generally leave behind code that is hard to understand. Then because only they understand their own code, they are usually the only ones who can navigate it fast enough to keep delivering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, going through the www.learncpp.com tutorial and am just a bit confused about these statements. I am totally new to C++ so I am very likely missing something.
 Firstly, as I understand it, modern inline functions are used for creating functions which, mostly likely by being included as header files, could be redefined again, and this is done to prevent errors (the One Definition Rule). Importantly, all of these definitions must be the same, or else undefined behaviour.,-The%20linker%20will) will result.
 Secondly, inline functions are used in header-only libraries because if they are redefined by the user in their code, there will be no compilation errors to to a violition of the ODR.
 Given all this, the problem seems to be that a user whom #includes a header with a certain function may then define their own function of the same name, which will result in a compilation error by violating ODR.
 What I don't get is that, if instead the header function was inline, the user defining a new function by the same name will probably have a different definition for the function, which will result in undefined behaviour. Surely it is preferable to have a compilation error alerting you to the problem (allowing you to just rename your function) than undefined behaviour at runtime?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been developing games professionally for over 3 years now, but it seems like the time has come for me to stop. In 2021 I started a game studio with my friend from university and we released our first game in 2022. Most of the funding for our development came from various grants and out of our own pockets. We thought that maybe some publishers or investors would be interested in our next game, but right now, as you might know, the industry is struggling and most studios have to figure out how to stay afloat and don't want to take any chances.
 Now we're about to release and self-publish our second title this July, but we don't have the numbers we wanted. Our biggest hope was Steam Next Fest, but with over 2000 other games attending right now, the chances of our game getting much attention aren't great... Our numbers for our game are around 3500 wishlists before Steam Next Fest, which doesn't seem like much, but it was a lot of work to get there, especially without a viral video or much marketing experience. Maybe there is someone out there who can relate to this situation and have some advice or words of encouragement because we could really use some right now.
 I will attach some graphs and a link to the game for context in the comments.

 That's what my context menu items look like.
 Why are they different when MenuIten is styled the same?
 The parent has an icon area, its children do not. The parent does not have a large border around it.
 Below is the style and below that the 'declaration' (for want of a better word).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although not strictly necessary in functional programming, I like to maintain the dependency inversion principle by using dependency injection to maintain control inversion and keep my modules independent from each other. Practically I've always achieved this by always having some kind of "init" function in all but my highest level modules that accepts function pointers. This allows the higher level modules that are dependent on this module to "inject" pointers to "callback" functions.
 I found myself questioning if passing these functions pointers at runtime, given that I don't ever expect them to change, is really the optimal solution here. Alternative ways to achieve this that I can think of are forward declaring the function I need, or just having circular dependencies. These both seems to significantly complicate life for the linker and feel I like that's bad practice.
 Actually, I guess I don't really understand why you would ever forward declare a function vs just giving the external function a header and including that, maybe that's part of the issue here?
 Maybe I'm architecting this fundamentally wrong, or maybe I'm just over thinking things, I'd love any feedback.
 Edit: I probably should have a given a code example from the beginning:
 main.c
 include "timer.h" void timerCallback(void){ doThings(); } int main(void){ initTimer(timerCallback); startTimer(); } 
 timer.h
 void initTimer(void(*callback)(void)); void startTimer(void); 
 timer.c
 include "timer.h" static void(*execCallback)(void); void initTimer(void(*callback)(void)){ execCallback = callback; } void startTimer(void){ wait(1000); execCallback(); } 
 Its kind of a dumb example it gets the point across, I'm basically asking what the optimal way is to call the timerCallback func defined in main from timer.c

And im not even doing this for a job or anything because if I need to do this as a job I would literally die before doing this.

After calling scanf() it will clear all characters until it encounters a space, which it will also clear and then stop. Thus if a user enters "Sam Jones" it will clear "Sam" and the space after it, leaving "Jones" in the input buffer. Or will clear all characters if there isn't a space until it encounters a newline character, but not clear the newline character. 
 getchar() just clears one character at a time. So if a user enters "Sam Jones", after calling getchar() "am Jones" will be left in the input buffer. Am I understanding this correctly?

 I know this is legitimately something that the asp.net community is fighting over but I'm really confused.
 I earn my wage with Python, specifically Django. I have written Java professionally before so I am somewhat familiar with the idea of mocking away your database stuff.
 But we actually write almost no traditional unit tests at work. Django makes testing with your production database system so simple that it feel more complicated to do it any other way especially because we do API only. We don't render HTML and therefore all our tests are:
  
Generate test data
 Call endpoint
 Compare output
  
And you get a bunch of other stuff that makes working with this very painless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've reached the point where Stack Overflow and ChatGPT aren't helping me so here's my post: I need to upgrade `okhttp` from version 4.9.3 to 4.12.0 because I need a fix for a CVE for the `okio` library which `okhttp` uses.
 I have a big old legacy Java app and none of the original developers who wrote it are available. I have several references to the `okhttp` dependency in various pom.xml files in my repo, all of them specify version 4.12.0 but for some reason, my builds keep downloading the old version (4.9.3). My only guess is that some other library that I'm using also uses okhttp but I can't tell which one. I could be completely wrong about that too.
 I've been digging through POMs and releases on Maven Central, in the okhttp GitHub repo. I've also been fiddling with `jdeps` and `mvn dependency:tree`. I have been tearing my hair out over this one. . . any help is appreciated.
 EDIT: I should also add that my project uses Java 1.8 and I cannot change that unfortunately (because all of the original developers are gone and I do not have the time/resources to upgrade to a newer JDK).

 we can use opencv to only import the picture and thats about it .
 we tried using the fit_ellipse and fit_line function , but were told that we could only use standard cpp libraries .
 another approach that we considered is to take the coordinates of all the pixels of the image and to apply the slope formula on the extreme pixels of the image , but here the problem lies in building an algorithm that effectively selects these extreme points .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on my first project that when signing up it stores the user's username and password then when signing in it checks the stored username and password to the user input to check if it is correct then proceeds to greeting the user when it matches. However on my first trial and error I could not get anything of it to work
 This is my code
 #include <stdio.h> struct database { char userName[20]; char userPass[20]; }; int main() { char *userOption[20]; char *signOption[] = {"Sign up", "Sign in"}; printf("Welcome to KlingKlang! \n\n"); printf("Sign in\nSign up \nChoose your action: \n"); scanf("%[^\n]s\n", userOption); // User input if Sign in or Sign up printf("%s", userOption); if (userOption == signOption[1]) // The user choses Sign In { struct database user1; printf("Username : "); scanf("%[^\n]s", user1.userName); // Collects the user's username printf("\nPassword : "); scanf("%[^\n]s", user1.userPass); //fgets(user1.userPass,sizeof(user1.userPass),stdin); // Collects the user's password printf("\nThis is your username : %s", user1.userName); // Welcomes the user printf("\nThis is your password : %s", user1.userName); } else { return 0; } }

 But I won’t lie - career advancement and pay is also a motivator.
 The job market is slowly eroding my motivation to learn and up-skill.
 Is anyone else feeling similar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are a relatively new Go team and are still finding our path in it. These days, I can't provide good reasoning to my team for why we should use the OO approach(the approach example in the link) or just use plain functions without receivers.
 I see a lot of Go code using an OO approach, especially creation patterns like the Factory pattern, Builder pattern, and Singletons. There's a lot of encapsulation tied to structs and interfaces with methods in them. I understand that Go is not a fully OO language and uses a mixture of OO, functional, and imperative programming.
 But we seem very confused about which approach is the best. My vision is the following:
  
Using certain OO creational patterns in packages.
 Using receivers in package functions where it makes sense and the rest is imperative.
  
Can the Go community tell me what is the golden middle?
 My manager wrote a package that contains just functions. My suggestion was that we should use the Factory pattern with a NewSomething() function that returns a struct. He reasonably questioned me, "Why is your suggestion better than what I did?"
 Various AIs provided multiple good reasons and all supported the suggestion I gave. What do you experts think?
 EDIT: here is another example of what I am talking about https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/bufio/bufio.go

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried using some C unit testing frameworks before and I feel like they either get too much in the way or are lacking some features I wish they'd have (the irony).
 So, my conclusion is I should probably roll my own, then I would only have myself to complain about.. 
 The issue is I am lacking inspiration and experience on this topic, so I don't really know what's a good way to go about this.
 I have big questions, like, what is it should I test exactly (functions, program output, composed functions, ect.) and how should I test it. Should I use assertions? macros? my build system? 
 I have no solid foundations on the subject of software testing, so I'm a bit lost.. I just want to have a system that is simple and I can use for a while until I am more experienced.
 Right now, I mostly write basic utilities, usually leveraging Linux syscalls (these can fail sometimes, so I believe I need to test that too, not sure tho). 
 Anyways.. I'm curious, what are YOUR strategies to make testing simple yet efficient, without relying on external dependencies?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, this might be more of a linux4noobs question, but I thought I might get more relevant answers here.
 So I have started my final transition fully to linux on my laptop, and 90% is amazing, but I have one big problem; blocky text, icons, and images in some apps. I am not sure what kind of apps it affects since some GTK apps work and some don't, I am not sure how Qt is affected since I don't know which apps use it. 
 Apps affected
 - Discord
 - Darktable
 - Firefox (only sometimes when opened by a different app, otherwise fine)
 - CurseForge app
 - VLC media player
 Apps not affected
 - Firefox normally
 - Terminal
 - EWW bar
 - Dolphin
 - Thunar
 - OBS
 I have read the arch wiki on font configuring, and a bunch of other posts on different forums, but am not able to fix this. I have installed Noto Sans and JetBrainsMono Nerd Font, but this seems to be more of a problem than fonts as even images in darktable are blocky.
 Video and images that might show something
 Solution
 The problem turned out to be programs using xwayland, so to fix that I added this to my hyprland.conf file: yuck xwayland { force_zero_scaling = true }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is going to be bizarre but hear me out on this one.
 One of the biggest themes of the game I want to make is the unknown and how you have to accept the fact that there are things you will simply never know. To parallel that, I want to put stuff in my game with the primary purpose of it never being found. These things wouldn’t have sort of huge lore relevance, nor would they be required to find in order to beat the game. They would just be there to deepen the theme of the unknown. I wouldn’t be surprised if players found some of them, but my goal is to make it impossible to find every secret within the game.
 I completely understand that putting something completely functional in a game that isn’t like developer-tools related is arguably bad game design and really weird to do, but I think i would be thematically fitting.
 My biggest question is well, how do I hide it? There are dataminers out there, and i feel like just datamining all of the secrets would sort of ruin the point im trying to come across. I understand it’s impossible to hold back dataminers forever but I definitely want to make the secrets nearly impossible to find within the code, and maybe just make it frustrating overall to datamine. I understand that the chances of someone datamining a game is relatively low, but once again, don’t want these things to be found, or at least not easy to find.
 The obvious answer would just be to not put it in the game entirely, but i still want these things to be theoretically achievable just so cryptic it is nigh impossible. I am completely aware of how ridiculous this all sounds but I just think it would be neat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love to hear what other devs have come across during their game development process, so I thought I’d start a thread for us to share things we’ve picked up
 Here are a couple of quick tips I learned:
  
.psb files are much more convenient when importing layered files into Unity. They come packaged like a folder, which keeps your assets cleaner and makes it easier to use. Took me way too long to learn this one. 
 
Add a colored tint to play mode in settings. It’s a really quick change and it’ll solve the occasional issue of tweaking values and resetting them after exiting play. I don’t think Godot has this problem, though. 
 
Git handles 2D projects pretty well and it’s very easy to set up. Takes 4 commands and 20 seconds to back up my work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From this [man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html), it is specified that before invoking the signal handler the kernel sets up a frame on the stack which contains various information about the machine registers, status word etc. In general situations we access this frame using ucontext_t which I believe is an abstraction from libc and not how the frame setup by the kernel really looks like.
 I am writing a libc implementation which implies I cannot use glibc's ucontext_t(or anything related to glibc for the matter) because that is not what the kernel provides in the stack frame. Does anyone have any idea what format the stack frame given by the kernel is in?

I don't know how many times so I need someone to clarify me on that front. What I found weird is that despite their bad history with it, they still attempt to do it, last time on Skyrim, this time on Starfield. At this point, I have to ask, is there a more lucrative side to shilling paid mods that us players don't know about that Bethesda is always willing to take the risk to do so with a new community or is Bethesda is just that dumb or uninformed about the player climate?

For performance critical jobs I have been using C and I have no objections. I don’t think any language comes closer to C. So I have been thinking, and found some articles claiming Rust or something to be closer to C. So my question is to experienced developers who have been doing it since Mesozoic era, is there actually any language modern day comes close to C?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my personal hobby project, which is of a medium-largish size for a single developer, I use copious amounts of templates. I don't use a large amount of concepts, but there are a few places where I have needed their functionality. A good example is CRTP base class calling a derrived class' method non-virtually, and only if that method exists -- in essence, implementing Golang's implicit interfaces, non-virtually.
 Since the beginning, I thought that concepts would increase compile-times, since template-related stuff generally does. However, I recently added a decent amount of concepts to an internal graph library. I have not noticed any type of compilation slowdown at all. Again, I don't have a ton of concept usage, but there is a non-trivial amount. I am pleasantly surprised.
 I'm using the latest MSVC 2022
 How are other people's experience with compilation speed when using concepts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel so lost and incompetent at my job it makes me want to quit
 Im ~8 months into a new job at a big tech company, and I have absolutely no idea what im doing.
 At the beginning I was also lost, but then slowly over time I started to gain more understanding, and got confident in what I was doing. About 6 months in, someone else on my team quit and I got hit with all their work instead, and all my deliverables got pushed back.
 The work is completely unrelated to my past experience/education. I don’t know what im doing. If you took away all my experience, put me in a 3 week Java bootcamp, then put me in this role right now, it would be the exact same experience. My manager expected me to be done with this work within a couple weeks. Its been 2 months and ive barely made progress. I had a 1:1 with him today and was on the verge of tears.
 Right now I just want to quit and go to another job so bad. I feel so lost and don’t have the slightest idea what im doing. I need some sort of advice as to what I should do to salvage this situation
 Update for those interested: I had a meeting with my manager and essentially told him everything I felt and what I needed for success. It went a lot better than I thought, and he essentially told me that the suffering part is inevitable for me to learn, and its fine that my deliverables are going longer than expected. Im going to take a day off to rest after a couple of really stressful past days, and come back with a clean slate. Thanks to all for the advice, it really was useful in helping me with my approach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am a recent CS grad. from a college in Chicago. The college is good, my GPA was about 3.81, and I graduated in December of 2023. Since then I have been applying to jobs left and right(1300+ jobs applied). However I have not been getting any interviews. I have a summer internship on my resume and have completed a few projects in IOS Development, ML and AI. I have also gotten accepted into OMSCS at Georgia Tech and will be starting in August.
 Since January I have been sitting at home-upskilling and applying to jobs. Now it has been 6 months and I have found no luck with my job applications. Therefore in order to payup my bills and student loan I have been searching for jobs nearby and got a shift leader position at Tacobell. Now even though I am not shy of working hard at a fast food place, I am feeling pity on myself as I did not get a job offer from my field. I feel like I am the problem and not skilled enough for the companies to hire me and I am worried about getting entry into the job market? I wanted to ask on this reddit community a few question:
  
Should I take the job at Tacobell and how should I be positive about it?
 Should I get more experience thought internships and coop? And do you have any good resources to find this internships/coops for Fall 2024.
 How can I improve my job application and get a better chance at landing an interview? Any certifications or any other skill that I should learn.
 What direction should I move forward with?

 I am a solo dev working on my first full project: "Devils Debt: A Card Game". With this post I hope to communicate a huge struggle from my brief but ongoing experience as a game dev, specifically one question I could not stop asking myself. 
 "Is my game even fun?"
 Sure I kept coming back to it day after day, but what was bringing me back? I had no way of separating the joy of creation, my creation, from actual enjoyment of the systems of the game I was playing. Then, the ideas stopped coming so easily. The systems became more complex and fragile. Issues I had not even noticed before snowballed exponentially as the game grew larger. I was stumped. 
 Then came the truly crushing realization. I booted up the game after taking a few days with just the intention to play it, no …]]></summary>

 I don't want a DM that depends on an entire Desktop Environment though, so no GDM. However, I do want a DM that is customizable. Everything points to me that I should go with SDDM then as it does seem simple and thankfully does not require KDE itself. I'd need Qt anyway, so that's not an issue.
 But are there any other DMs that might fit better and how well does SDDM work with Plymouth?

Also, some technical books on C++ like C++ for Dummies are entirely based on Code::Blocks, and many YouTube videos also are.
 So, is VS Code a real alternative to Code::Blocks, or is Code::Blocks just a thing of the past that keeps lingering around due to old habits?

 After almost an year into this journey of fun and challenges (especially the PPU, my god!) and the help of this community, I've been able to complete my GameBoy emulator in C++ 17.
 I've pushed it to be as more accurate as possible: indeed it passes all the most known tests roms for DMG such as blargg, mooneye and even mealybug (tests results, detailed list also in GitHub pageand).
 It can be used both with the standalone SDL frontend or as libretro core.
 Take a look also at the CLI debugger in GDB style: it offers a complete and fancy visualization of the entire system (supports step by step at M-cycle or even at T-cycle precision, breakpoints, watchpoints, visualization of CPU, PPU, IO, Memory Buses, ...).
 In the next months I'm going to address the next big missing chapters: the sound and the colors (CGB); wish me luck!

 No clue how to format my entire code into reddit so here's the pastebin link. Testing with the input (a, b, c, d, b), having the assignment in the else block gives "the mode is d". Putting the assignment outside of the else block gives the correct answer "the mode is b".
 This is strange to me since I tried tracing the code by hand as best I could and I think it should work even if the assignment line is inside the else block.

 I've read a bit about dynamic loading libraries, and it looks like it could be used for this, but it seems extremely complicated to use if you need to manually get a pointer to every function you plan to use. Is there an easier way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I applied for a part-time SWE role at a lab on my university campus. During the interview, my boss told me he expected a year-long commitment (part-time during school, full-time in the summer). Before accepting, I mentioned that I received a summer offer at a Unicorn. We agreed I could take the summer off to pursue it.
 A few days ago, I was extended an offer for a fall internship at a FAANG company. I plan to take the fall semester off for it. It's full-time—$51/hour versus the $20/hour I earned on campus. It would help immensely with tuition.
 My parents are pressuring me to take it. But I'm scared that my boss at the lab will be angry with me. He is incredibly kind and patient and has never gotten angry with me, but I worry he will view my leave as a betrayal. (I fully intended to work for him for the next year—I had no idea the FAANG opportunity would land in my lap.)
 What do I do? How do I break it to him? What if he retaliates? What if the FAANG contacts him during my background check and he denies that I worked there to spite me? I have bad anxiety and don't like confronting people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During my career, I've had to implement a gaming framework multiple times (>4) for different clients. As my experience grows, the performance and features grow each generation. My previous engine is a Vulkan renderer with an Actor programming module and hundreds of features, smart caching, its blazing fast and incredibly complex. The number of engineers that understand the engine is small. 
 My latest client requires an educational rendering framework, its really simple to read and understand, basic features and simplistic caching, and lacks the "squeeze the last drop of performance out of the code" design. The number of engineers that can understand the code is high. 
 I must confess that I'm enjoying working in the simpler code base more. It lacks complexity, but also has less features and performance. I'm beginning to question whether extra complexity is really worth the hassle. Of course, it all depends on the target project. 
 There is a comic that shows the journey from beginner to expert to guru, and the guru code matches the beginer code.
 Any gurus on Reddit willing to share their experience on how they approach new dev projects after doing the beginner->expert->guru journey. Is simpler better? Or since the gurus have the know-how, do I continue pressing pedal to metal to gain a few extra percentage points performance (and make the beast scarier to maintain).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found a bunch of unknown devices on my wifi network. The apartment I live in has wifi they pay for as part of a package, but I have my own account. I called Spectrum and they gave me a Mac address for the main unknown device which was coming from a Belkin_ext router. What I noticed:
 My wifi signal (MINE) and the signal for Belkin_ext were the same strength as I walked around the property. 
 When I looked at the belkin_ext router info on the wifi settings list, the Mac address was the same for the mystery devices that had been previously connected. They matched. This is new to the apartment and mine is close to the office. 
 I blocked new devices from entering and changed my password and name. Then 3 devices were blocked from connecting (apple and Lenovo pc). 
 This whole thing started when I reported illegal activity in the complex to the property manager (Charged with ID THEFT but didn't jail time). 
 I suspect cameras or bugs, and an RF detector picked up from only one outlet. But I cant find anything in there when pulled out...
 I am really stumped how I can prove this. Does anyone have advice? She has a personal vendetta against me for no valid reason. I'd love some of your help in making sure I take correct measures to police. And making sure it's HER. I can't see her router but maybe I can see something on the public lounge computer. 
 Thank you!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I am trying to understand the way caching and prefetching works by playing around with a raspberry pi 3b.
 I have a piece of code which empties my cache and then traverses an array. To make a long story short, since the traversal of my array is linear (hence spatial locality) and almost nothing else is done besides traversing it (hence temporal locality), unless I get preempted, data should get cached. The fact that I traverse my array linearly implies that it is also very easy to predict what next data will be accessed allowing my CPU's prefetcher to do its job and therefor never experience cache misses. Yet, I still see consistent cache misses at every 64th byte (i.e. 16th index in the case of this experiment).
 Code: https://pastebin.com/raw/Mp85NDEW
 corresponding output: https://pastebin.com/raw/evXmggBf 
 You'll see that the access times of 38, 54, 70, 86, 102 are high which is exactly 64 bytes apart every single time.
 I was wondering whether anybody would have some clues about why I am seeing these consistent misses at what corresponds to the end of a cache line?
 EDIT: prefetching is enabled at the hardware level

There is a complete lack of response, normally your disappointment in job search would include some ghosting after interviews and some rejections but it’s radio silence this time around. I'm now even applying to local jobs that are asking for office/hybrid. The only thing I can think of is that maybe some hiring managers are turned off by me having no Linkedin? I have 3 years of experience and two proper engineering jobs under my belt.
 I have also started to just look up companies and find their postings on their career websites in addition to indeed / LinkedIn but that didn’t help either. 
 Can someone please shed some light on the current state of things, is anyone getting hired? I think I'd be glad to hear someone got a job offer at this point because it would mean things aren't as bleak. Located in U.S.

 How do I config Visual Studio to run the app in the debugger with stdin redirected to the app? Say I want to redirect c:\temp\debug.txt file to stdin? 
 What I want do to is 
 sort <c:\temp\debug.txt | app.exe
 So the output of a different app redirected to mine.
 Is there a way to set this in the properties so when I hit 'f5' it debugs my app getting the input from the output of sort? I can figure out other ways of debugging this but I would like to have this available.

 When it comes to QA teams they’re often even more understaffed than dev teams are - meaning there’s even less capacity to train grads and entry-level staff.
 And my understanding is that devops isn’t an entry level role anyway. 
 So stay on the grind and don’t give up, but don’t think you’ll have an easier ride going for non-dev technical roles

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our framework is inching towards a v1 and we wanted to make it public so we could start gathering constructive feedback.
 It's a React + ASP.NET framework that can be used freely without limitation, we'll be open sourcing soon.
 We're a small team that's developed and used it on a few projects over the past 2 years with great success. 
 A few notes on what makes Xams unique - 
 Build one model, your data model, and use attributes to define what’s exposed to the UI and some of the UI behaviors.
 Data aware React components automatically know how to bind \ interact with your data model.
 You can query your entities from the UI using sql like syntax.
 Easily write business logic \ security on any CRUD operation
 And a lot more...
 If you're interested, feel free to check it out https://xams.io
 If would be greatly helpful if you could answer - 
 Would you use this? Why or why not?
 Any constructive \ helpful feedback is much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I want to share a project for which Golang support was just added:
 https://github.com/gabotechs/dep-tree
 This is a tool that allows users to visualize the complexity of a code base using a 3D force-directed graph:
  
It will take a Golang codebase entrypoint, typically `main.go`, it will parse the file and gather other files in which this file depends on (by resolving function names, types, etc...)
 It will recursively perform this operation with all the dependant files, until the full graph with all the source files is formed.
 It will render the graph using a force-directed layout, and all the source files will be placed in a three-dimensional space simulating some attraction/repulsion forces based on the dependencies between them.
 Clean and loosely coupled codebases will tend to form clusters of nodes in the 3d space separated from each other, while tightly coupled and messy codebases will be rendered with all the nodes grouped together without clear sense of separation.
  
Here are some examples of rendering this graph for some well known projects:
  
Docker compose
 Ollama
 Gin
 Go's crypto std
 CockroachDB SQL parser
 Ethereum
 Dep Tree
  
Hope you find this interesting!

 So I googeld a little bit and there is no nativ client. The "best" thing seems to be insync, but $$$, no thanks.
 Then we got the option to use it with kde/dolphin(kio) - nope, bc. the old tutorials all explain a way which doesn't work anymore due to google's sequirity changes.
 Also, we got rclone, but that looks complicated.
 Plus, we got ocamlfuse, but the package from the aur doesn't work.
 So, what do you guys use?

 Pretty much all was said in the title, I am transitioning from Ubuntu to Debian Sid, but I cannot get GNOME (wayland) fractional scaling to provide the sames results as in Ubuntu.
 To sum it up, I have a 1920x1200 display on my laptop, and I am setting the fractional scaling to 1.25 ;
 However while on Ubuntu everything is sharp and crisp, on Debian text and stuff is blurry.
 How can I get the same behaviour in Debian as in Ubuntu ?
 Thank all for your help !
 PS : 
  
I know of the font scaling trick, but it doesn't address my use case ; moreover, I don't understand why Ubuntu would get this working while Debian can't ;
 My question is specific to fixing an issue with GNOME, I know that KDE has better fractional scaling support, but I do not want to switch DE.

 After A year or so, My programming logics became frim but never knew how language worked.
 A year later I am looking myself like a clown, who can't even write a simple project properly 
 I need help
 Please recommend resources that can help me understand language from low level perspective .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 Although I know not all programmers here use VS Code, I just want to share my first VS Code extension: Bread Jam! 🎉
 NOTE: You must install the ms-vscode.cpptools extension to make this extension work.
 Bread Jam is designed to enhance readability in your code by making lengthy variable names easier to manage. It allows you to customize the colors of these components, helping you to quickly identify and differentiate between various parts of your codebase.
 Features:
  
11 Render Patterns to select
 Customizable Color Coding: Tailor the appearance of your code to suit your style or project needs.
 Multi-Language Support: Currently supports JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, Dart and more.
 Quick Toggle: Easily switch the extension's effects on or off using keyboard shortcuts. Use Alt + B, Alt + J for Windows & Linux or ⌥ + B, ⌥ + J for MacOS.
  
I'd love for you to try it out and share any feedback you might have!
 VS Code Marketplace
 GitHub repository
 PS: A screenshot of the effects of this extension is in the comment section.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have 3 classes - A, B and C. C inherits from B which inherits from A. (C->B->A)
 Now chatGPT showed me this weird syntax which I've never seen before but seems to work.
 For this object:
 C obj;
 he did this to access a member of A
 obj.A::x;//x here is a property of A
 meaning he accessed A, as if it was a member of C that only inherited from it.
 Now, not only does it work, but it also does something that confuses me. Let's say that all 3 classes have a public integer variable named x that is initialized to 0,1,2 for A B & C respectively. If we do this:
 obj.x = 12;
 cout << obj.x;
 cout << obj.B::x;
 cout << obj.C::x;
 the output will be
 12
 1
 2
 meaning each of them reserved its own property?
 Maybe I just didn't know this and that's how it is supposed to be(I used to think the member is being "overridden"), but this is my first time seeing it and so I had to ask.
 (P.S sorry in advance if you see any syntactic flaws in my code snippets as those were written manually off of something that I executed and did work)

For an assignment I have a list of password hashes along with a hint of what they could be. In this case the first set of passwords are a kaiju followed by three digits and a single lowercase letter with an MD5 hash applied to them. The second set off passwords are a basic color (think crayola basic 12 set teachers words not mine) followed by a kaiju name and these are a SHA-1 hash. I was able to get one password from the first set and I was able to get 4 passwords from the second set. l've been coming up with wordlist after wordlist but nothing else has cracked and l've been wracking my brain for the past 3 days. If anyone is willing to offer some advice it would be hugely appreciated. Also l've been using hash-identifier, hashcat, as well as Johnny for this assignment, and I think l've got the basics down for how they work

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to announce that mistral.rs (https://github.com/EricLBuehler/mistral.rs) has just merged support for our first vision model: Phi-3 Vision!
 Phi-3V is an excellent and lightweight vision model with capabilities to reason over both text and images. We provide examples for using our Python, Rust, and HTTP APIs with Phi-3V here. You can also use our ISQ feature to quantize the Phi-3V model (there is no llama.cpp or GGUF support for this model) and achieve excellent performance.
 Besides Phi-3V, we have support for Llama 3, Mistral, Gemma, Phi-3 128k/4k, and Mixtral including others.
 mistral.rs also provides the following key features:
  
Quantization: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 bit quantization to accelerate inference, includes GGUF and GGML support
 ISQ: Download models from Hugging Face and "automagically" quantize them
 Strong accelerator support: CUDA, Metal, Apple Accelerate, Intel MKL with optimized kernels
 LoRA and X-LoRA support: leverage powerful adapter models, including dynamic adapter activation with LoRA
 Speculative decoding: 1.7x performance with zero cost to accuracy
 Rust async API: Integrate mistral.rs into your Rust application easily
 Performance: Equivalent performance to llama.cpp
  
We would love to hear your feedback about this project and welcome contributions!

 When I graduated, I realized I could have started learning coding and programming on my own, but I didn't have anyone to guide me, so I didn't. I really wish I had started in my first year because then I would have been ready by the time I graduated, or even sooner, many guys I knew started their job before graduation.
 But of course, I don't regret going to college for the degree by any means. I'm actually glad for my degree.

 I wrote this in Go, because I wanted a simple, yet fast log viewer which doesn't need heavy middleware such as Elastic Search, or a separate DB which require many steps to setup.
 The log viewer reads logs directly from the disk, and can perform search using regular expressions etc, with realtime update capabilities. 
 Results are displayed in paginated form, and auto judges the log level as info, warn, success etc.
 Since it is written in GO, I embedded the frontend inside the binary, so it can just be downloaded and ready to use using simple command gol in the directly to match all log files, including ones that are tar.gz

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I finally finished my first Go project, it's called goManageDocker (pun intended). 
 I was really annoyed by how often I forget docker commands (especially since I don't use it for all my projects) and have to look basic commands up, which takes me out of my workflow and might introduce distractions. After finding the command, even typing that becomes annoying since you have to type two commands most times (one for getting the id or name of the object, which I do most times, and the other for the actual command). I felt this whole thing could be streamlined. 
 Sure, GUI docker management tools exist but I did not want to open a browser that takes half my RAM (electron duh..) and then use my mouse to point and click buttons for a task like this.
 Enter goManageDocker, a simple TUI tool that lets you manage your docker objects with a single keystroke (seriously), it has vim keybinds for easy navigation and you can do any action with a single keystroke! All of these for a few megabytes of RAM too!!
 If this does pique your interest, you can find the repo here!.
 I'm open to any feedback as well. 
 Thanks

I considered posting this to r/rust, but here seemed more appropriate/likely to get helpful replies.
 When upgrading a Rust application (kickoff in this case) from the AUR, it starts with its endless stream of crate dependencies. (237 of them, I'll have you know. Gotta love ecosystems when not being a developer. 😏) This goes ~well, but at the final step (kickoff(bin)itself) the build seems to stall, rustc working hard (using well over 2G of RAM) and somehow making input and mouse laggy some.
 What's worse is that the package fails to build - at least in this case, it may just be coincidence. (I could paste the entire…]]></summary>

 This definitely was one of the harder tutorials I've made so far, as my tutorial style usually involves me kind of narrating the functionality as I type it out, and with Go I found myself constantly stuck or stuttering trying not to sound like Yoda when typing shorthand variables declarations lol.

Now I was following a tutorial for C, and I remembered earlier he said that to clear input buffer you can use fflush(stdin); but when I was using it, it still didn't work, so I searched and copied code from geeksforgeeks (line 25 or after scanf("%s", word);). #include <stdio.h> int occurence(char *ptr, char c){ int num; while(*ptr != '\0'){ if(c == *ptr){ num++; ptr++; } else{ ptr++; } } return num; } int main(){ char to_check; char word[50]; printf("Word: "); scanf("%s", word); while ((getchar()) != '\n'); printf("Character: "); scanf("%c", &to_check); printf("Occurence (%c in %s): %d", to_check, word, occurence(word, to_check)); return 0; } Idk how either of fflush or this code is supposed to work, I just know fflush wasn't doing what I wanted it to do. Can someone please lmk what I was doing wrong when using fflush.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The key to efficient programming is finding a solution based on your goal. The programming language should be nothing but a catalyst to achieve this.
 There is no doubt that C and C++ are some of the most popular and important programming languages but new programming languages have emerged, offering a variety of frameworks that give explicit functionality.
 Programming languages are tools. Some tools are beneficial for specific tasks, some aren't.
 A hammer cannot see a plank of wood and neither can a saw hammer a nail. Ask yourself what you want, then work towards that specific goal by designing good software.
 Don't force yourself to use these just because everybody says so, do you.

 Been learning programming with Python for this past year, year and a half, and find myself completely hooked!
 My IT manager has been talking about wanting me to work more with the Dev team, but presses on me to start learning C#.
 I did some work with it earlier with Unity, and also some basic testing by setting up some APIs, but really the more I work with C#, I want to go back to Python.
 Can't really put my finger on it due to my inexperience, but there's something about the logic of Python, the dev space and everything that speaks to me.
 With C# on the other hand, I feel like it relies more on using robust frameworks that have been iterated on again and again, as opposed to creating what you need from the bottom-up.
 I also see myself more drawn towards scripting. How can I enhance my SQL? How can I use this to handle the moving of x different files based on these rules and so on. I want to solve problems quickly, and with little hassle. I don't want to spend four weeks just getting an API running before I can start properly testing and improving it.
 Am I wrong in thinking that Python is for me and C# is not, or is this just me forming an opinion when I simply don't know enough about C# development?

I really like his design and am considering adding him as a character to a freeware video game I'm working on, but I want to make sure I'm able to legally do so. The in-game appearance of him would be an original model I create for the game, so I'm also not sure if I would be crediting specifically the Duke project repository as its owner. The game also isn't coded in Java, though I'm not entirely sure if that would affect whether the character can be used or not. Obviously, I would put a notice somewhere in my game that Orcale isn't affiliated with the game in any way.

 My current job seems to be sort of obsessed with processes.
 We're talking, running SAFe™, but also is introducing Lean™ and Kanban™. Some of it doesn't even fit together.
 They want to incorporate Lean™ so we can focus on whatever is most important at the moment, but also deliver a PI for our SAFe framework, which does Scrum with sprints, but we should use Kanban....
 At the same time, they're also trying to change naming, implement different Domains™ and move to The Spotify Model™ for team organisation (which I now am being forced to call a Squad instead of a team, under pain of being interrupted every time I mention a team).
 It feels like this is a little bit of overkill, a combination of FOMO around agile processes and also not really knowing what'll work best and just hoping to throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks.
 Do any of you out there have experience with a process heavy company, and ways to manage this? Effective ways to push back against an abundance of this, or even just a mindset shift so I don't pop off in my fifth Lean training session?

 My display is connected to mx GPU via HDMI which I also use for audio. In general this works fine, but I noticed when I step away from the machine and sometime later return to a blanked screen, when I press a key and the visual comes back, the audio does not.
 I have these cards
 $ cat /proc/asound/cards 0 [PCH ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel PCH HDA Intel PCH at 0xf5430000 irq 91 1 [NVidia ]: HDA-Intel - HDA NVidia HDA NVidia at 0xf5000000 irq 17 
 When it happens, the system switches to "0" and "1" is no longer visible in Plasma's sound popup.
 If I disable "0" in the BIOS/UEFI, audio still gets lost and no cards show up.
 I can get sound back by $ systemctl --user restart wireplumber.service, but that still takes about 10s from issuing the command to actually getting sound back.
 I suspect the problem is some kind of power saving setting, but so far I was not able to find a solution. It's a desktop machine so I'd rather spend the extra Watt than being inconvenienced all the time.
 Any pointers welcome, thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've often seen how people talk about Alacritty's performance for example, given it is GPU-accelerated and written in Rust (hence compiled from a low-level language with very little overhead), but from my personal experience, I notice little to no difference from any other terminal emulators, at least not anything significant. I might want to add that my work environment and tools are mainly CLI-driven, and I mostly use CLI applications for everything (text editor, Git CLI, etc), including all the tools I use for my daily work.
 When choosing a terminal emulator, I focus mostly on usability and features. I personally use Wezterm because I find it incredibly malleable and easy to configure, while also providing very nice defaults. When I have used Alacritty in the past, I have found myself not liking it because it sacrifices a lot of things for the sake of performance, but I find myself unable to perceive the benefits of such performance improvements.
 I wanted to hear people's opinions mainly because I think I might be missing something, so please feel free to share your ideas and experiences.

With fresh grads claiming to be a front end dev after a crash course, i think i need to expand my skillset bucket and join the party! Can someone suggest if the move is right? I like front end alot , but i want some change in my day to day work and remain employable. I am 8 YOE. A lot of the issues may be in my head, thus asking your POV.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for recommendations for the best books to learn C—best for me, not necessarily the best for everyone. Here's a bit about my situation: I'm a complete beginner. So far, I've only written a couple of loops and a basic calculator in C by watching some tutorials. But I can't really follow tutorials; I get distracted, and my productivity plummets. A two-hour study topic takes me all day if I'm watching videos. I'm much more comfortable learning from books.
 So, I'm looking for a book on C that starts from the very basics, like setting up the programming environment in Ubuntu, and goes all the way to advanced concepts like OOP, pointers, data structures, algorithms, and so on. My plan is to start with C and then move on to C++, Java, Kotlin, and Python. Almost everyone suggests starting with C, so that's what I've decided to do.
 I need a book that begins at the ground level but eventually covers advanced topics. It should also include problem sets and their solutions to help me grasp programming fundamentals. Bonus points if the book explains why a particular solution is the best among all other possible solutions.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, i am trying to make a matrix template which uses std::vector as its datatype
 So,
 template <class T> class Matrix{ private: std::vector<T> mData; // entries of matrix int mNumRows, mNumCols; // dimensions public: //constructors and such 
 aswell as a constructor etc. Now i am trying to overload the unary minus operator (-), so that i may take a matrix of this type M, and write -M, in order to negate all the values of the matrix.
 My code snippet looks like this for it
  Matrix operator-() const{ Matrix<T> mat(mNumRows, mNumCols); for (int i = 0; i < mNumRows; i++){ for (int j = 0; j < mNumCols; j++){ mat.mData[i*mNumCols+j] = -1*mData[i*mNumCols+j]; printf("[%g]\n", mat.mData[i*mNumCols+j]); } } return mat; } 
 Now if i print the entries of my matrix inside these loop, i can see that they are negative, however the object returned in my main function does not have negative values.
 Very confused why that is happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure whether this is more appropriate for r/cpp, but I thought I'd ask here first.
 I always use nullptr over NULL, for the reason that overload resolution with NULL can lead to surprising outcomes because it's an integer, and not a pointer. (also it's shiny and "modern", or it can be considered more idiomatic C++, I guess)
 So I'm working with a new team member who is not convinced. He thinks this reason is really obscure and that you will rarely, if ever, encounter a real life scenario where that reason comes into play. I couldn't come up with an organic scenario that could happen in real code, and to be honest - I don't think I've seen something like that in the wild.
 Would you insist on strictly using nullptr in your codebase? I keep seeing him use NULL in his pull requests and I'm starting to wonder if I should stop being the "code police" and give up on this battle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I've recently put significant effort into enhancing my library for generating fluent builders and I believe it has now matured enough to be applied to most use cases. Fluent builders are very convenient but writing them can be tedious. The idea of this library is to generate the builder class from attributes on the properties and methods of the class to be built. The latest updates include
  
Support for generics and partial classes
 Enabling of optional builder methods
 Branching capabilities
 Support for returning arbitrary types
  
If you're new to this library, you may find the storybook helpful. It explains the library step by step and provides a comprehensive overview of its features. You can find a link to the storybook, as well as additional examples, in the readme on GitHub.
 To illustrate the usefulness of the library, you can have a look at the diagrams in this excellent blog post by Mitesh. The fluent API described in the post can be crafted in about 5 minutes using the library. An implementation can be found in the comments of the blog post, as well as in the example project included with the library.
 Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions. If you would like to get some input on how to use the library in your use case, please create a GitHub issue with the label `design help request` and you will receive timely feedback.
 Happy Coding!,
 Kevin

 I wanted to make a pixel art game for a long time. I got the inspirations from Stardew Valley, Thimbleweed Park, Undertale, Celest, Iconoclast. I have Aseprite for pixel art sprites and google a little bit for coding for a game and decided C Sharp is good enough for making simple games. I want my game to run good under potato specs so you can play it any device anywhere.
 I have ideas for a simple bracelet game to make. I have ideas for RPG game. I also have probably an hour or three a day to spend on this hobby project. That includes learning c sharp, learning pixel art/drawing (I also dont know that) and making the game. I also picked godot engine for the game development. It is free and open source and that's all i want.
 I dont know if i am aiming to high or if this is achievable at all. I am planning for a deadline at all. if it takes 10 years so be it. As long as i am satisfied with every bit of the game and art i am okay with it. I am making a post beacause i need advice or suggesttion for my goals. I dont want to learn or do wrong things and reliase later that all of that was for nothing.
 For learning i have bought a cource or udemy (it was cheap) and for pixel art i have anothe cource (I got for free) if you have any other resource or forum or subreddit for beginner c sharp programming and pixel art games that would be helpfull as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello; ever since the initial post I made a few days ago, any remotely intensive graphical program on my Arc GPU freezes my system constantly on Arc, with the error of "kwin_wayland_drm: atomic commit failed: cannot allocate memory" flooding journalctl whenever the freezes occur on Wayland. I do not have the error saved, but a similar issue occurs on Xorg.
 I have tried everything even up to completely reinstalling Arch, and the issue still occurs. This has also apparently been happening to people on other distributions as well, with some people even reverting back to Debian but still getting the issue. Does anyone know a fix for this?
 Edit: would like to mention that this is also apparently occurring for someone running a GeForce card, as well.
 Edit to explain what I have tried to get my GPU functioning properly again, nothing has worked so far:
 -Reinstalled my desktop environment
 -Used a different desktop environment
 -Used both Xorg and Wayland
 -Downgraded Mesa to a previous version
 -Completely reinstalled Linux
 Edit again: found the issue; the headers for kernel 6.9.3 REALLY do not like Arc for some reason. If you're having the same issue that I did, revert both your kernel and its headers to 6.9.2 or earlier; I'm currently running on 6.8.9 if 6.9.2 does not work properly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently discovered two games that took the “it’s not a glitch it’s a feature” to a whole new level...
 Grey Box Testing (Gameplay): This game feels like a quirky version of Portal, where you use bugs as game mechanics to beat the levels. You can noclip through walls, pause the menu to stop moving objects, and find all sorts of creative ways to navigate the game. It’s super inventive and a lot of fun.
 Memory of a Broken Dimension (Artstyle): This one is wild. It feels like a game that’s intentionally broken, with an incredible glitch art style. Objects and cubes only show up when you look at them from certain angles, making the whole experience confusing but amazing. It’s mind-blowing how the game turns these glitches into something beautiful.
 Do you guys know any more games like these? Indie gems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am 28 working at an investment bank. I have an undergrad in finance and law from a target, but have taught myself python to the point where I have automated the most tedious aspects of the job using web scrapers, pandas/matplotlib, and bloomberg API connections. 
 I haven't told my team or junior peers how I do everything so much faster than them but they have some idea because they see lines of code in Jupyter on my screen all day. The most tedious part of my job has become exporting my works to excel and linking formulas when someone higher up wants to see my workings (though this is becoming less common as trust is built over time). 
 I'm growing more and more keen on the idea of spending some serious time after work (which I have enough of) embarking on a more formal CS training path with a view to build a portfolio of simple apps and hopefully retrain to a full time CS career. My linear algebra is a bit rusty but I am familiar enough that I think I could get back on the horse in a few months.
 I guess I want some feedback on whether my age rules me out of transitioning to CS at a level that would be comparable to my existing career path in IB. 
 edit: thank you all for your input and wisdom. my takeaway is that I should stick to my current career path (which I don't mind) but pursue cs as a side hobby to the extent that I am able to continue teaching myself. I guess FAANG is probably out of the question, and it seems that would be the only way to match the comp potential of my current job. I realise being an ok programmer in finance is a very long way from the forefront of the industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm learning data structures and algorithms again, and I've struggled 2 or so days trying to implement linked lists in c++ using structs and functions. I learned the basics of pointers and dynamic memory allocation. I used chatgpt's "tutor me" where'd I ask it to guide me step by step on how to implement the data structure. I asked it not to give me any code, because I felt that I would look at the code it gives me and think "oh i got it" but when I actually try to code it myself, I, in fact don't got it. So it would give me steps like to check edge cases to be aware of, and ideas on how to traverse the list. I struggled even with it giving me clear steps on how to write each function for search, insert, delete etc. I ended up using the pseudocode to help me out from visualgo.net . Is that okay? I felt that I took the easy way out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! First and foremost, I apologize for any ignorance or nativity throughout this post, I’m still a teenager in college and do appreciate the infinite wealth of knowledge I lack.
 I have written a decent amount of Java years ago (within the scope of Minecraft) so I’m syntactically comfortable and have a decent understand of the more common interworkings of the language, but these days I do most of my work (backend, mainly) with Golang.
 I’m curious, are new systems even being built with Java anymore, like does the language have life outside of necessity of maintaining older software? I understand that much of its edge came from its portability, but now that I can containerize a NodeJS server and deploy it just about anywhere, what is the point?
 This isn’t coming from a perspective of arguing the language is “dead” (as stupid of an expression as that is) rather I genuinely want to be educated by actual Java programmers to what the longevity of the language will look like going forward.
 TLDR: Why build with Java when there are much faster alternatives?
 Have a great day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I'm using the WINAPI functions, many of them have arguments with additional context explaining the argument will be taken in (IN) or another will be modified (OUT).
 I was curious because other ways variables can be passed is through the return value as value, pointer, or a status struct (like struct { int status; err_t err; }), or passed through arguments in the same way.
 Are there any benefits using one over the other? For example, writing if guards or branching for some API calls (or series of them) get a little hairy due to multiple OUT arguments being modified rather than one return value.
 Assembly-wise are passing pointers as OUT arguments faster than returning values? Can one be optimized by the compiler and not the other?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have Spring (not Spring Boot) project with Gradle. I would like to add React to it, but I don't really know how to configure project to make everything work together and I can't find tutorial on this topic.
 I would like to compile both frontend and backend into war file for deployment. I would also like to make everything work as "one project" instead running everything on separate ports (I am not sure if this is good or not?). Like I would not like to run each time Java and Node separately if that is possible.
 Best tutorial I saw was this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5tcZoNyqGI but he is working with Maven and he is using proxy which I am not sure if it can be avoided (or that is best option)? He is also depending on some plugins to deploy React and Maven together which I would like to avoid so I don't depend on someone updating their plugin when new version of Java/React comes out and something changes.
 Maybe this is not hard thing to do, but I have basically zero experience in configuring project in this kind of way.
 Any advice is welcome

 For instance, in the above code, the destructor for the array object will be called after this line: array keys(1000,999); or after this line: return 0; 
 My program runs fine otherwise but when it is trying to call the destructor I am getting an error.

I'm an experienced software engineer with about 12 YOE, and for the first time in my career, I'm going through an extended period of unemployment. I was laid off from my last company during a restructuring last November, and I haven't had a lot of luck finding a new role yet. I'm reaching a point where I will need to start considering other roles possibly outside of the tech world just to keep some kind of income coming in.
 My question is, what kinds of jobs out there are a good fit for someone in this position? Has anyone else with a lot of developer experience taken a job during a layoff (even if only temporarily) and found it to be a really good match, or possibly a rewarding experience? Does anyone have a "go-to" kind of job during layoffs or downtime that they look for to maintain some kind of income?
 Thank you for any advice!

 I could perform a first iteration to count the total size, allocate memory and perform a second iteration to concatenate everything manually. The problem is that it is too verbose.
 I know about std::fmt, but the number of fragments has to be known at compile-time.
 Java has the StringBuilder class. It collects each fragment and build the full string in the end. Maybe C++ has some third-party library with this feature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Correct me if I'm wrong but about two decades ago (mid 2000s), most popular software in the FOSS world was GPL licensed including Linux, WordPress and Drupal.
 And then started a massive crusade of sorts against copyleft as folks started calling out GPL as "viral" and "infecting" of their downstream works. They started to prefer permissive licenses more as it suited some people's definition of software freedom. The GPL folks, on the other hand, made it an all or none issue, they wanted to license ALL software under GPL and the other side thought that idea was anti diversity.
 This is very much akin to the editor wars of the Boomer era (Vim vs Emacs) or the IDE wars of the millennial era (Visual Basic vs Borland Delphi, even Netbeans vs Eclipse).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've been learning C++ for a few months and I'm making a rendering engine as I go and at first, I relied heavily on classes/oop, but I've had people tell me that it's easier and less of a headache to avoid that style of programming and stick to structs that only store data and free functions.
 I feel like this has made the thought process and writing code easier, but I feel like I've made certain things unnecessary like I essentially just have everything as a free function for example I created this object class
 ```
 struct SceneObject {
 std::string name;
 glm::vec3 position;
 glm::vec3 rotation;
 glm::vec3 scale;
 <Model model;
 };
 ```
 and then created a free function to print its data
 ```
 void printObject(SceneObject& object);
 ```
 It probably doesn't make any sense to do it like this so I wanted to know how I can better determine if if a function should or shouldn't be part of a class?

 Now what I'd like to do is have T be deduced from the first argument of F. Is there a way to do that by modifying the definition of ForEach without having to do ForEach<Derived> at every callsite?

 But when studying my professor's code, I noticed he has the habit of doing it like so:

 Is there any reason to write a printf statement that only used plain text like that? Is it just about preference, or is there an actual difference?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working at a startup for the past year, and it's always been a very stressful ride. The most stressful aspect for me is the expectation of working overtime, even sometimes during the weekends, with no extra pay. I'm usually understanding if it's about something important, like fixing a broken feature in production, but it's a bit hard on the mental when I'm asked to work otherwise.
 It's even gotten to the point where I'm having to drop whatever I'm doing in my personal life to attend 1-2-hour meetings at 7/8pm. I'm at the point now where I carry my work wherever I go, and, by that, I mean that I'm not only anxious about being messaged about work out of the blue (say, if I'm out with friends or spending time with my parents), but I also just can't get off of work mode because of it. I can't relax.
 I've talked about this with some (and, by "some" I mean only 3) friends in the industry, and their advice was the same: "Then work for a corporate company. Clock out at 5 and relax.". That's been their personal experiences, but I'm wondering if this is the experience people have in general having worked for corporate companies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now it seems there are quite a few nice looking error propagation libraries out there. Generally speaking such systems are pretty infectious within a codebase so choosing wisely is quite valuable. Reading the docs is useful, but in my opinion not much compares to actually having to live with and work with facilities. In that vein I was hoping to get some insight from people who have used the following libraries as to how they are once deployed; are there unexpected issues or benefits, any regrets; maybe it is rock-solid and doesn't get a second thought? 
  
Abseil Status
 Boost LEAF
 {Boost,} Outcome
 tl::expected
 std::expected 
  
While there are many differences between the above libraries it seems that perhaps the biggest, in API terms, is whether or not the error type is universal or not. absl::Status has a single error type for all possible errors, whereas the other libraries seem to take a bring-your-own approach. I'm more used to Abseil's approach and was curious about people's experience with writing their own. Do you write many error types and have to convert (perhaps noisily?) between them, do you end up with one big error type that you use most places, etc? Are there any missing from the above list that I should look at?

 1.The constructor sets an initial string of 0 and 1. It is most logical to represent it using the modern template std::bitset<>. 
 2.The constructor sets the initial combination, which must be arbitrary. 
 3.operator() receives a new one from the previous combination and issues it if all possible ones have not been searched. This check is performed by comparing the new combination with the one specified in the constructor. The return value of operator() is used to report this situation. 
 4.A getter is entered to get the current combination. This approach allows you to skip the required number of combinations by calling operator() on them, but without immediately calling getter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A group of developers managed to hack multi-billion dollar companies in just 30 minutes by creating a malicious VSCode extension that leaked source code to a remote server.
 
They exploited vulnerabilities in the VSCode Marketplace, such as creating a copycat extension of a popular theme and using a fake domain to gain credibility.
 
Within days, they had numerous victims, including employees from publicly listed companies and even a country's justice court network.
 
Realizing the risks, they decided to delve deeper into the issue of malicious extensions in the VSCode marketplace.
 
They initiated a responsible disclosure process with over 10 multi-billion dollar companies to help mitigate this security risk.

 Now that I have experience with the two languages I often find that when I code a project in C i end up defining code that kind of looks like object-oriented code but without the class abstraction and typing system. That is to say: I create a struct to hold all of the data I need to manipulate and then I create functions that pass a pointer to that kind of struct to manipulate it in various ways. As far as I understand this is very similar to the concept of classes except without the added concepts of inheritance and polymorphism, etc. (I …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm making a little function that can show me how much time my sorting takes.
 I want to use a system call as I'm learning the linux programing interface.
 I made this time.c function
 double getTime(){ double time; struct tms buf; long clkTick = sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK); long value; value = times(&buf); //debug print printf("value: %ld\n", value); // time = (double)buf.tms_utime/(double)clkTick; return time; } 
 Which I'm using on my main function
 double startT,elapsedT; startT = getTime(); quickSort(array, 0, NUM_DOUBLES); elapsedT = getTime(); printf("Elapsed Time: %lf\n", elapsedT - startT); 
 But the output is not giving me any time elapsed in contrast with the /bin/time output
 //MY FUNCTION value: 430118749 value: 430118749 Elapsed Time: 0.000000 // /usr/bin/time output real 0m0.008s user 0m0.000s sys 0m0.008s 
 On this test I'm sorting through 10k values. the /bin/time application has enough of a small tolerance to show me something, but my implementation does not show the same. (If it is a tolerance problem at all)
 I even tried to read the implementation of /bin/time on https://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu/gnu/time/time-1.9.tar.gz
 and on "reuse.c" they use a similar call to the times() systemcall
  long value; struct tms tms; value = times (&tms); resp->start.tv_sec = value / HZ; resp->start.tv_usec = value % HZ * (1000000 / HZ); 
 (I'm sure the answer is there on this code, but I'm not skilled enough to understand it) 
 Can anyone give me some pointers on whats wrong with my time.c function? Thanks!

I did all my coding assignments and tests last semester without using return 0 and never had an issue. This semester, my professor says that we must use return 0 and it's incorrect if we don't.

I shared the game with friends a few times to try and see how they find it but it seems that every time I share, they are less and less interested to the point where It's becoming a easier to share it with a random person on the internet or paid play tester. 
 I also don't know any other game devs. So the hobby feels a bit like a solitude. I spend big part of my time on the game and I have practically no one to share it with or noone with similar hobby to regularly talk about our projects in real life.
 I found a discord and facebook group in my country of game devs but they seem completelly unorganized and a suggestion to meet up had only a few responses and those faded away over timre. So no luck there. 
 Feels lonely. It would be fun to spend time/know people that share the hobby/interest of developing games. 
 How do you do it?

Second is that it doesn't provide completion of keywords like template, typename and so on. The last but not least is that it enables auto insertion of angled brackets (for types in templates) and braces for functions, nevertheless those are disabled in vscode itself. I haven't found any meaningful lists of commands in google, so it'll be nice to get some help on that. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm returning to C# after around 7 years of not working with it, and seeing that we now have stricter nullability checks makes me very happy. However, I'm having trouble using them when fields are initialized in a method called by a framework or a game engine, such as Godot or Unity. Example:
 #nullable enable // Example 1 - I will set _graphics in the Godot editor UI, // and I want the game to crash if I don't. [Export] private Sprite2D? _graphics; private Sprite2D? _someOtherSprite; private Set<Node2D>? _setOfThings; public override void _Ready() { // Example 2 - _Ready is guaranteed to be called once, // before any other method from this class is called. _someOtherSprite = GetNode<Sprite2D>("SomeNode"); } public void MyMethod() { // I want both these fields to be considered non-null here. _graphics.Scale = _someOtherSprite.Scale; _graphics.DoSomething(); // I still want strict null checks for everything else. if (_setOfThings != null) _setOfThings.Add(_graphics); } 
 Ideally I'd like a field or property to be excluded from nullability checking if it is initialized in _Ready, or if _Ready has an assertion like ThrowIfNull(_graphics) for that field.
 Is this currently possible in C#, given that these variables are not initialized in the constructor? If not, what are some workarounds I can use to exclude some fields from nullability checking?
 Thanks!

 Here is his Threatening messege https://imgur.com/a/Fg9QtYn
 I'm a computer science student reaching out during a challenging time. I created a project, FlyMile pro, a flight search engine that finds flights on credit card points. Originally designed to enhance my resume and secure internships, it surprisingly attracted over 10,000 sign-ups!
 However, recently, I've been facing some distressing challenges. The CEO of PointsYeah has accused me of scraping their website, a claim that is entirely baseless (I have my GitHub commits, my code never interacted with his site). I hadn't even heard of PointsYeah until about a month ago, when I stumbled upon a mention in a Reddit post, Despite this, I received a message threatening to shut down my site (see message screenshot).
 Last night, our website was bombarded with an unusual amount of traffic, which seemed like a deliberate attack, and I've been receiving calls from random international numbers. I even found MilesLife - his previous company having payments issues with merchants - I will not comment anything on that, you are free to explore.
 I’m feeling quite overwhelmed by this, especially since this project was meant to be a positive addition to my learning and future opportunities. I've worked hard to create something useful and educational, not just for myself but for a broader community.
 Has anyone here experienced something similar? How did you handle it? Any advice on how to manage these accusations and protect my project?

That made think of creating my own library which I did. After that, I only include it in my project then access its functions that I need depending on the project.
 It made my life much easier and it feels good and satisfying when you access functions from your own library with them being documented, as if it was a standard library. 
 In a way, it satisfies my OCD. 😅

batch executes commands when system load levels permit; in other words, when the load average drops below 1.5, or the value specified in the invocation of atd.
  
Question: What is the correct way to change this value? 
 I realize I could go to /etc/init.d/atd and modify the script, but that could get overwritten any time. Supposedly values for the /etc/init.d scripts can be entered in /etc/default/atd, but I can't find any description of what is expected here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hospitals in London have had to cancel cancer operations this week because of a Russian cyber-attack that continues to cause serious disruption to NHS services in the capital.
  
Cancer surgeries delayed: St Thomas’ and King’s College hospitals have been forced to postpone cancer operations due to the cyberattack. This critical delay is because the attack crippled their ability to provide blood transfusions, a vital procedure during many cancer surgeries.
 Widespread disruption across NHS services: The attack goes beyond these two major hospitals. It's impacting six NHS trusts and dozens of GP practices in southeast London, affecting millions of people's care. This disruption includes cancelled appointments and likely extends beyond just blood-related procedures.
 Lack of transparency causing unease: While NHS England acknowledges the attack and its impact, they haven't released details on the number of cancelled operations, including critical procedures like transplants. This lack of transparency is causing frustration and unease among both staff and likely patients who are unsure about the status of their appointments.
  
Dr Chris Streather, the medical director for NHS England’s London region, said : “We are sorry to all those who have been impacted and staff will work hard to re-arrange appointments and treatments as quickly as possible.”

 But when trying to install nvidia drivers, no matter which guide I follow, I always end up with a frozen cursor in the top left on a black screen after rebooting. No way to get into a tty, not able to find any logfiles with the boot stick (no syslog had been created).
 I have no idea what I could have missed, as I tried following the arch wiki, several online guides or automatic scripts, always with the same result.
 Maybe someone here had the same problem or some idea what could be the problem.

 On the other hand, more beginner friendly distros felt better to use, were more stable and had that "it just works" feeling. Also, everything that can be done in Arch, can be done in other distros. 
 So now, what does Arch do that other distros don't? to justify its complexity?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wondering this mostly to see if I could possibly assess myself.
 Yeah I have a good amount of YOE, I have passed a lot of interviews and held the menagerie of titles. However, I notice the titles don't mean much at different companies. Maybe in "big name" companies they have these very standardized "levels" but I have never been in one of the big name companies.
 Also having read some posts here where people complain about "15 YOE Junior", hmmm.
 So I wondered...
  
Is the difference in the level of complexity of a single problem that I can solve? If yes, then how do I know the "level of complexity" of a problem.
 Is the difference in the velocity at which I work? If yes, then how do I know if I am at the right speed, at half the speed, or at double the speed of my level.
  
It is funny because companies sometimes define this degree of expertise by how you relate to the other coworkers, such as "solves questions from coworkers" or "provides mentorship" or whatever. But these seem irrelevant to me on a technical level because, even though I can do that, it merely speaks to the way that I compare to other people in the same company and has more to do with "soft skills" than anything else.

(It runs fine on my computer). Is there a setting in my visual studio to turn that off? Does windows not like the raw .EXE? It's a simple game that's written in C with Allegro. It's only a single statically linked .exe. The game itself is a "work toy" like a fidget spinner you have at your desk at work. It's a little micro RPG that plays itself, but you can poke at it when you are bored. The idea is you can play from anywhere-- I even included a "boss key" like in the old days that turns it into a little digital clock.. Do I really have to wrap it in an installer or something to make it secure? I really don't want to do that as I would like to keep it so you can run it from anywhere. (Also as it's a little work toy some companies don't let you install stuff!)

Anecdotally, all the people that I have met who love Go come from PHP/Python/C/C++/Java/C# environments, therefore I am wondering if it’s their lack of understanding how FP code feels like or it’s me being stuck in FP-land and failing to see obvious benefits of Go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am an experienced linux engineer. I know bash, python and SQL pretty well. I am learning C++ and java at my new software support job. Done some automation with docker, powershell, and ansible. Done some powerbi and excel pivot tables. Now working on APIs, AI and bot projects. I feel like all this can be summed up as a devops engineer already. But it's mostly been support for 11 years. Salary is $90K. I want to double that before I turn 40. 35 now. I learned linux mostly from one other job and my own home server. Before that was sysadmin windows and hardware for 9 years.
 Is this enough to apply for devsecops positions in the next couple of years? I want to focus on backend engineering. I like being a linux expert, I like the scripting and I love to use python when I can. I'd like to pivot away from support and maintenance to just development and little interaction with clients. Wouldn't mind checking out quant either. I am currently leaning on my dev team at my current company to help me out and take me under their wing in the next few months or so. I plan to stay at this company for at most 3 years. but won't look down on any $180k offers that may come my way before that haha What should I look for after that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm learning go from Bodner's 'Learning Go: An idiomatic approach' and came across the following comparison of interface implementations across Python, Java, and Go (Chapter 7).
 I think the book is trying to illustrate how Go makes it easy to use statically defined interfaces without losing the ability to change the implementations of interfaces easily. I don't understand how the Java code differs from the Go code in satisfying this criterion of static interface/flexible implementation. They both look the same to me. In both cases the client defines an interface and the publisher (logic provider) implements some logic object conforming to that interface. In both cases, the main() function constructs a client object using the logic object and calls the `process' function defined by the logic object. What am I missing here?
 Java code:
 public interface Logic { String process(String data); } public class LogicImpl implements Logic { public String process(String data) { // business logic } } public class Client { private final Logic logic; // this type is the interface, not the implementation public Client(Logic logic) { this.logic = logic; } public void program() { // get data from somewhere this.logic.process(data); } } public static void main(String[] args) { Logic logic = new LogicImpl(); Client client = new Client(logic); client.program(); } 
 Here's the Go implementation
 type LogicProvider struct {} func (lp LogicProvider) Process(data string) string { // business logic } type Logic interface { Process(data string) string } type Client struct{ L Logic } func(c Client) Program() { // get data from somewhere c.L.Process(data) } main() { c := Client{ L: LogicProvider{}, } c.Program() 
 }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking from my perspective, Python is an awesome language which is closer to human language and has a bunch of great and useful libraries that ease coding. However, I think it shouldn’t be the first language for a programmer to begin his learning with. 
 I think a programmer should start with languages like C for example . C language helps understanding fundamentals as C is a low-level programming language that provides a strong foundation in computer science concepts like memory management, pointers, and data structures. Understanding these concepts helps you become a better programmer overall and makes it easier to grasp higher-level languages like Python.
 And overall, it’ll develop your problem solving skills and computer resources management, which are important in programming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I appreciate the opportunity to work remotely and the flexibility it provides, I've noticed a significant lack of communication and support from management, particularly my manager and tech lead. In fact, the only time I seem to interact with my manager is when I need approval for time off or have HR-related questions. This distant relationship is quite different from my previous experiences where I had open and frequent communication with my bosses.
 I've also noticed that the majority of my team members are Desi India, which makes me wonder if the lack of communication could be attributed to cultural differences. I stated this because I had a manager who was Desi India at my last company for month and he never attend stand up and left everything to the tech lead before he was replaced replace.
 Despite expressing my concerns during a 1-1 meeting with my tech lead after three months on the job, little has changed. While I was reassured that I was doing a good job, it's difficult for me to understand how that assessment is made when there's minimal interaction or feedback. Additionally, I've observed discrepancies in the level of support provided to different team members, which is concerning and leads me to question my role within the team.
 When I participate in stand-ups or lead meetings, it often feels like my contributions are overlooked or ignored. As an African American engineer, I can't help but wonder if I've been hired for diversity reasons rather than for my engineering skills. This realization is disheartening and leaves me feeling undervalued and frustrated.
 I turned down other job opportunities earlier this year because I wanted to commit to this the commit for at least 6 months but the current situation has left me questioning that decision. I believe in the potential of this company and the work we're doing, but I also recognize the importance of feeling supported and valued in my role.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing some people learn before programming is Pseudo Code, which is actually writing the code in your language in sequential steps, then you write that as a code.
 Even though you don’t right it as a code, just writing Pseudo Codes helps you a lot developing the way you think and write your code.
 A simple example:
 You need a program that adds two integers, Pseudo Code will look like something like this:
  1- Define a variable (x) to store the first Number. 2- Define a variable (y) to store the second Number. 3- Define a variable (sum) to store the sum of the integers. 4- Add the two integers and store them in (sum), which is sum = x + y 
 Doing that for more examples will help you think smartly and more logically, then you’re gonna start doing that in your mind automatically without having to write that.
 Yes logic is sometimes frustrating at the beginning, but trust it’s gonna be fun and satisfying later.
 Good luck

 #include <atomic> #include <thread> #include <type_traits> template<auto Func> class WorkerThreadFactory { public: template<typename... Args> class WorkerThread { private: using result_type = std::invoke_result_t<decltype(Func)&, Args...>; std::thread thread_; result_type result_; std::atomic_bool complete_; public: bool complete() { return complete_; } result_type& result() { return result_; } WorkerThread(Args &&... args) { complete_ = false; thread_ = std::thread{ [&result_ = result_, &complete_ = complete_](Args &&... args_inner) { result_ = Func(std::forward<Args>(args_inner)...); complete_ = true; }, std::forward<Args>(args)... }; } }; template<typename...

 int add(int a, int b) { return a+b; } int main() { auto add_worker = WorkerThreadFactory<add>{}; auto worker = add_worker.make(1, 2); 
 However, if the argument needs to be a reference, like so, it fails:
 int add(int &a, int &b) { return a+b; } int main() { int a = 1; int b = 2; auto add_worker = WorkerThreadFactory<add>{}; auto worker = add_worker.make(a, b); 
 I believe this is because if an argument is passed by reference, you have to pass in that argument with std::ref to std::thread. Is there a modification I can make to this line that will correctly pass in the arguments as needed for any arbitrary function?
 result_ = Func(std::forward<Args>(args_inner)...);

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I think about progressing up the software engineering ranks, what gives me the biggest concern is not the coding, but managing large codebases. Even on my personal projects when things go wrong with git, I am often lost as to what is the right thing to do, I've read the docs, done tutorials but I still don't understand what is really going on under the hood. Especially when it comes to merges, rebases, reflogging, conflicts etc
 Does anyone else feel this way?
 But I am curious to the senior devs, how good are you with git? If you've 'mastered' git, how did you do it? Or do you any of you still get git-anxiety!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to break into quantitative finance for my next job. I graduated university a year ago and am working in a financial technology company and working on latency in C++ for real time systems.
 I went to a top 20 school and did CS albeit bad grades due to personal reasons. Always did well in finals but was missing all semester.
 What’s the best course of action towards maximizing my possibilities? I am looking to start applying 18 months from now.
 A. Project: Something in an FPGA, maybe creating an arcade Minesweeper, or something more finance-y
 B. Study: Using that time to leetcode harder and get better at quant riddles and the general interview. Also using that time to learn from MIT OCW classes.
 I will quit my job and give myself 3 months full-time towards studying for the interview for this job.
 Thank you.
 EDIT: I have been unclear as to what I mean by the word ‘quant’. I mean Quant Developer (e.g. Algo Dev at HRT). Not Quant Research.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I am trying to understand how constness works for double pointers, and so far, my answer is "it doesn't".
 From what I've read, the way the const qualifier works for a pointer is that if the const qualifier is before the *, then the constness applies to the thing being pointed at, while if the const qualifier is after the * then it applies to the pointer itself. Therefore a const int * is a pointer that you can have point to multiple things without issue, but cannot change the value being pointed at. For double pointers, the logic I have says that const int ** dp is a double pointer where you can edit dp, dp[0], but not dp[0][0]. and const int *const * dp means I can change dp, but neither dp[0], nor dp[0][0]. However, when I actually use this, I get weird compiler errors that tell …]]></summary>

 I've started on it in the beginning of the year (with very limited time to actually work on it), to have a background project to learn quite a few other things I wanted:
  
modern C;
 CMake (organising a project into libraries/apps);
 CMocka, for unit testing in C (my implementation is fully backed with tests)
 ncurses library
 passing my code through many linting tools and learning from their feedback
  
Next steps from here:
  
Improve the UI to provide more debugging information with memory, registers, buttons, etc
 Write Python bindings and being able to drive it from Python (another learning objective)
 Write the equivalent in C++

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joking aside, there are some traits of code or even specific patterns that you see during code reviews and get really annoyed immediately. 
 What are these for you? 
 I am really unhappy when I see Java-style pre-emptive interfaces all around without any serious reason. That immediately shows that the developer just translates the existing skills without even caring for the language best practices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been looking into system backups since rolling back bad decisions is super easy on nixos. A BTRFS file system with a snapshot utility and grub-btrfs seems to be the closest to the nixos implementation from what I read. However that seems to require compiling grub-btrfs from source.
 I have never compiled a tool for my system before. As I understand I would need to try and manually keep up with update the package. Worry about dependencies due to debian having slightly older versions. And making sure to remove them on system upgrade.
 As I want the system rollback because I am trying to learn more about my system while acknowledging I could screw everything up, this seems like a bad idea.
 So I am curious what would the easiest/safest option be? Simply hope that I don't mess anything up too badly so I can get at least get past grub to use a basic timeshift reversion?
 I apologize for being ignorant. Reading into btrfs backups and ext4 rsync backups has gone a bit over my head and I don't want to blindly follow tutorials. So the plan is to find a starting point then try and understand it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work at a company that tends to have an "all hands on deck" incident culture, very similar to this post from r/sysadmin. My team owns an application networking infrastructure platform that has internal developer teams as our customers.
 We have built our platform to be almost completely self-service to developer teams, including providing telemetry tools (logs, metrics, traces) that developers can use to troubleshoot problems that pass through our platform.
 However, our team has noticed a pattern during incidents where a developer team and/or their leadership will pull our team into incident troubleshooting meetings if our platform is involved at all in the impacted business/application flow (ex: Client -> Platform 1 -> App 1 -> Our platform -> App 2).
 As a result of this, our team has become more efficient on ruling out our platform from the problem (using the same self service telemetry tools mentioned before). For 95+% of incidents, our platform is not the problem and it ends up being an issue with another developer teams application. This efficiency has saved us a lot of time and avoided blame for incidents, but the constant pull for our team still adds up and results in a lot of wasted time on these incident meetings.
 From a business perspective, leadership wants us involved whenever possible to reduce business impact and MTTD/MTTR. We are struggling to find a way to change the organizational culture where developers will use our self service tools to troubleshoot incidents rather than relying on us to interpret the telemetry for them.
 Have you all had similar experiences at your companies as platform owners? If so, how did you improve this culture so that your team reduces toil and gets more time to work on platform improvements/features?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys Recently i have decided to learn cloud, but obviously there is a question, which one? So i was wondering which cloud you saw being the most frequently used when working with Go and which you recommend? I know i could learn 3 of them, but I guess I should specialize in one - keeping track of all of them could be impossible since I still have other things to learn and like other things to do. I feel vibey about GCP, I think it has a chance to take off and being there as spec when it happens might boost mu career. AWS - when i look at the UI i want to cry, but truth to be told they have the biggest share in the market and it looks like safe bet job wise right now. Azure - I worked with it and I liked it, but i havent seen many projects using Azure in conjunction with Go, rather saw GCP/AWS. Any thoughts, thx and Regards!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I've been a game developer for a while, and have released a few projects that are out on Steam, but they're adult only. We're trying to get a larger audience for our next game, and I've been considering streaming and doing YouTube, but the issue is really that the games are intended for an adult audience, so naturally my reach is very limited. How have other devs of adult games managed to still gain some traction despite this?
 Naturally, places like Twitch and YouTube would be a good start, but I'm not sure that the effort I put into there will automatically be kneecapped and shadow-banned, even if the content is not necessarily explicit. I might even just be barking up the wrong tree, or maybe I'm just not in the right social spaces where I would market this kind of game. Any advice would be really helpful. Thanks!
 Edit: Since someone asked, here's a link to the steam page. Steam | Lust For Lucre

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throughout my career, I've always created a new development branch for each feature, where I freely commit, amend, and squash as needed. I push the branch to the remote and open a PR/MR to run the pipeline.
 Recently, while collaborating on a feature, a peer insisted that I shouldn't change the history of my branch. He argued that keeping the history intact is better for collaboration since it allows him to track my changes easily. I understand his point, but he was also against manually squashing commits before merging, preferring GitLab to handle it automatically. Moreover, he believes that no one should ever change the history of their personal branches, even when working solo. To me, this feels like an unnecessary restriction on my workflow.
 What are your thoughts on this?

 Just as the title says, I manually installed Arch on a external SSD drive (SATA to USB, so it’s meant to be a portable Arch I can take with me without needing my own hardware everytime). When I rebooted after the install the screen stopped with a line saying: watchdog0: watchdog0 did not stop! (As in the picture)
 Why is it failing to unmount? I do miss small details (I try to do better believe me), but I’ve been looking online but I can’t find anything regarding this specific situation. Can any here point me in the right direction? It would be appreciated!!
 The SSD is a 120GB from 3D nano and I’m using a ASUS X555L laptop with intel i5 processor and 8GB of RAM and a Nvidia Geforce 820M graphics card to do the install and the latest iso downloaded with a torrent client.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For reference I have about a semester's experience with C++ with pretty freaky homeworks.
 I'm trying to print to the terminal blank sheet music. for reference, lets call sheet music this string:
 "
 "
 in practice there's going to be more lines but you get the idea. The problem I have is how to continuously print horizontally. I tried multi-threading a print function with different offset values but it still ends up on new lines (I dont have endl) here's my current attempt:
 // testing how to continuously print music stuff
 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>
 #include <string>
 //function staff prints out a "-" on a provided offset
 void staff(int n) {
 std::string vertOffset = "";
 for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
 vertOffset += "\n";
 std::cout << vertOffset + "-";
 }
 int main() {
 for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
 std::thread t1(staff, 0);
 std::thread t2(staff, 1);
 t1.join();
 t2.join();
 return 0;
 }
 my goal for calling this code is this result:
 my current result is this:
 - -- -- -- -- - 
 Today's my first day writing with threads btw soooo please excuse my stupidity with them lol.
 at this point I might just look into writing it to an output file / printing vertically and rotating my screen 90 degrees xDD
 any and all help is wanted!!

 I tried using webview solution, but ran into performance issues regarding animations. I rendered this Radial Tree using D3.js. When I tried to rotate it, it lagged so bad that it feels extremely uncomfortable.
 I want to build and animate something like this .
 Outside of rendering and animating structures like this tree, I also need the ability to render "regular UI elements" (just like HTML, CSS can).
 Which tools should I use? Thank you very much.

 I want to do some YouTube videos about the architecture of the PSOne and several PSOne games for a semi-technical audience. For this purpose I think some simple animations, using a vector graphics style, might help me get certain ideas across for a non-developer.audoence.
 I'm kind of thinking about the animations you sometimes see in system design videos - you know, the ones walking you through how to build a URL shortener etc
 What kinds of software can I use to produce these animations? I'm hoping AfterEffects isn't the only answer, because AE is expensive. Any recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for some outside perspective on a situation that arose at my job. I’ve been working for ~3 years at a company with a small (6 person) Dev team. We have 3 tech stacks and 2 people per stack for redundancy. I’ve got 15yoe overall.
 We’ve never had an on-call chart despite the rest of the larger IT team having one, my job description says “occasional nights and weekends”. I do, however have a company provided cell phone I leave in another room at night.
 Last week there was a network outage impacting our applications and leadership struggled to get anyone on the phone from Dev to help out at 3am.
 The next day leadership declared that the expectation for us was now that we have to be available 24/7 and able to get to our tools quickly unless we were on PTO.
 I was livid so didn’t ask any follow-ups, nor did the rest of my team. I’ve already started polishing my resume but really have enjoyed my job up until this moment. But, I have 2 toddlers and place tremendous value on my personal time and sleep isn’t always a guarantee.
 I’m left wondering, what does this mean if I plan to hike or camp with out internet? What does this mean if I have a few beers? What if I’m driving out of state to visit family? I refuse to clear these types of things with my job.
 Does anyone have any experience as a Dev with this type of demand for availability? I’m at 15yoe and never had this. This policy isn’t covered in the employee handbook either.
 I plan on fighting this - curious how you all would go about it, what questions you would ask, would reach out to HR?

 I can see linux market share rising from 4% to 6% or very unlikely 7% but no more than that. Specially because people still think even ubuntu is hard to use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just passed the final round of interviews for a company where the posted salary range is above my actual market value (176-220k, whereas my market value is actually about 150k, if that). I've never actually been in a situation like this so I have no clue how to approach the topic of compensation in my next meeting with the hiring manager. What should I even be asking for? It doesn't seem right to just ask for the lowest amount, but I have no clue how to justify to them anything higher. My current situation to be justified at the moment is: VHCOL area (northern LA), married with no kids but wife can't work, and 4 years of general SWE experience with two degrees from a top 5 university, and the field is gen AI which I've been working in for a year now. How would you proceed in this situation?
 Edit: Just to be clear, I got my "market value" of $150k by looking at websites like Levels.fyi and Blind, along with just what I've been generally seeing on job listings on LinkedIn, Indeed etc. I've been looking for 3-4 months now so I've seen A LOT of JDs. That being said, I am also looking only for remote jobs which may be skewing it to be a bit lower. This salary range of 176k+ is definitely above average. I don't think I'm selling myself short. That being said, I think I'm just going to ask for a mid-range value and hope it goes well.

I am sorry if this question is stupid but I feel like the Odin project is moving too slow, I am having to read multiple articles about something like tables in HTML that could have been done much quicker. I really need to keep up if I wanna build with them.
 Has anyone else found it slow or is it me who's the slow one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im facing a situation at work Im not sure how to deal with. I work on infrastructure and automation for my team in a niche industry and was hired about a year ago to design a tool for data ingestion that takes some documenation and manual test procedures, parses them into a database, and automates them. 
 Over the last year I implemented most of the functionality, did some A/B testing, collected user stories, and got feedback from the other devs, etc. Things seem to be going over well.
 But last month we get a new dev from another team, two years out of college. He is smart and capable, but seems to be out to prove something. Unprompted by anyone he decides my implementation is shit, refactors half of it, and glues on a new front end. He makes a proposal to my manager who accepts the changes, and spends half the presentation just shitting on my work (without ever having spoken to me about any of it or seemingly aware that I was sitting right next to him).
 Granted his work itself is not bad and it addressed some pain points, but I was pissed at the unprompted changing of half the codebase that made half the docs and tests obsolete. He is getting alot of credit for my work as well as the core infrastructure still runs on my code, but the rest of the team seems to have forgotten about it. The only reason he could refactor anything is because I solved the technical challenges first. I was finally about to move on from this project, but now have to play catch up on all the technical debt he made. The way he made the proposal really got on my nerves too. 
 Am I being too precious about my code? How am I supposed to react to this? I dont think he conciously meant to step on anyones toes and was just tunnel visioned on making improvements as engineers tend to do, but just the way he did all this without building any trust in his team first really rubbed me the wrong way. What do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello, 
 i ve tried two kind of implementations: the verlet approach and the force driven approach. (https://www.vobarian.com/collisions/2dcollisions2.pdf)
 the first on is effective but not very interesting from a simulation perspective : it doesn't take collision energy in account.
 The second approach is way better but i can't find a way to handle collisions when the density is too important: this approach doesn't move the particle, it edit the speed vectors. in a sparse world, it works perfectly. When the world is dense ( of particles) the algorithm tends to push a particle inside another one : 
 Particle A and B collides, so the algo changes the vector speed of the two particles, then the position is updated using real world physics. but it happens a lot that after this operation , partiicle A or B is now colliding with particle C. In this order it's not a problem because C will be processed afterwards. But if after collision between B and C one particle is inside or colliding with A, ill have exactly the opposite behavior : they are now attached or one is included in another one. 
 I suppose this is a standard problem when you want to use real world physics and not just verlet. it had been adressed a lot of times i hope...
 Do you have any ressources on this subject ? i know how to use google.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am sick and tired of all the cash-grabbing game-dev events where they charge like $500 just to meet people face to face and get to feel the industry vibes. I've pooled my resources and rallied my industry friends to host an event for up to 1000 people — completely free of charge.
 Why:
 I'm from Montenegro, a small country in Europe. For years, I was the only person here in the game-dev scene. I felt isolated and alone for a long time. But now, we have a bunch of relocated and remote teams, and we want to inspire future generations to see that you don't need to be in a major industry hub to make it big!
 What I've done:
  
Venue: Locked in an amazing seaside resort called Porto Montenegro who saw the vision and has an airport.
 Agenda: I'm working on a space where you can showcase your indie games to publishers for investment, connect with other devs, listen to keynotes and party with friends.
 Support: Fundraised enough resources and got commitments from my network to back this event.
 Date: I've locked in October 25, 2024 as I hope this will give me enough time to pull this off.
  
No hidden fees, no corporate BS — just pure, unfiltered passion for game development
 Please let me know what you think of this idea! Any advice, help or support would be much appreciated!

I’m out of the loop on so many things I could help with. I’ve lost trust in my manager by not working independently enough and trying to be transparent about how I am building things and what is being asked for, so much so that getting the opinion of someone more experienced has made it so they now think I’m too junior to do anything other than having all our resources renamed to fit our new naming conventions. 
 Is my only way out, a way in somewhere else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the main features of a separate /home partition that I read everywhere is the ability to "reinstall the system without affecting user data".
 Do you ever do that? And why?
 And if you do, is it even successful for you? Some system configuration is stored in directories other than /home, but I would wager that a lot of "crap" that builds up is actually in the user's home directory (e.g. related to app configuration).
 Finally, what about stuff that is not "user data" but that you do care about? E.g. I am always very protective of all the custom configuration I made in files in /etc. It would be terrible for me to lose it...

 On Arch Linux my temps are:
  
Idle - 55C
 Browsing Firefox - 60C +
 Watching videos - 60C +
  
On Windows 11 temps are:
  
Idle - 45C
 Browsing Firefox - max 55C
 Watching videos - max 55C
  
Why is my GPU so much hotter on Arch? I love Linux but I'd rather not want to have the GPU fans revving up and down every couple of minutes as it reaches 60C. 
 I have tried with Hyprland, XFCE (x11), Gnome and KDE (Wayland and X11) all is almost same.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm at such a point in my learning where I know a lot and at the same time I can't seem to be able to use my knowledge in practice. I have learned C for almost a decade and I know a lot of things about memory, CPU, pointers, binary etc etc. I can reason about C code and I can investigate and study it. I can write small programs and functions with ease, but I have troubles when it comes to building an actual application.
 When I write code for projects it feels as if I'm doing everything wrong. I seem to be obsessed with details and I have a hard time focusing on the big picture. It seems that whatever I do, in a matter of days I'd scratch everything and start all over again. Imagine you are an artist and you have a blank canvas and you sketch something, but then you hate it and you destroy the whole canvas. I've been doing that over and over with my coding.
 So how do I actually program? I'm talking about developing solid software projects rather than toying around with code. If there are good resources on the matter, I'd be extremely happy to study them, from my searches a lot of the things I've found seem to be either overly abstract and corporate or they seem to be very surface level and not what I'm looking for. I want to go in depth, but perhaps I'm just an overly ambitious idiot ;_;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi cpp community,
 I am a dev working on a huge cpp code base and I have never really used constexpr in my daily job as a cpp programmer. I think I understood the basic intent of constexpr and what it tries to tell the compiler in terms of optimization. However I often hesitate using constexpr since I don't really profile the runtime performance of single functions or the compilation times (with or without using it). In addition, I think that it often can't be used if you heavily use concepts like polymorphism and therefore may even extend the compilation time. 
 TLDR: I want to use it more to optimize my runtime performance, but miss a clear guidline when it should be used. Due to my concerns regarding compile times, I wouldn't place it everywhere in the code. As a programmer: Maybe a static code analysis tool would be great that notifies me if it might be useful. Do you have similar experience or even advice for me? 
 Best wishes!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Long time lurker, first time poster.
 I would like to present you my first "real" Go project, panosse.
  
panosse is a CLI tool to clean, encode, normalize, and verify your FLAC music library.
 It is merely a wrapper around flac and metaflac and uses Cobra and Viper under the hood.
 ```text Usage: panosse [command]
 Available Commands: clean Clean FLAC files from blocks and tags config Display panosse configuration encode Encode FLAC files help Help about any command normalize Normalize FLAC files with ReplayGain verify Verify FLAC files ```
  
You can find panosse at https://github.com/ludelafo/panosse with all details regarding its commands, configuration and a concrete example to demonstrate its usage.
 As this is my first experience with Cobra, Viper, the Golang ecosystem and more overall, sharing an open source project on Reddit, criticism is more than welcome.
 I did try my best to provide all details and good practices to invite people to contribute to panosse if they want to.
 Thank you for taking the time to have a look at this post! Take care :)

I understand that ref is pointing to the same space of heap memory that list1 is pointing to and that ref2 is pointing to the memory address where list1 is stored. Being that is the case, then why doesn't otherAdd function operate in the same way? Why do you have to use a double pointer like in the add function. What I'm getting at is that you can change the values held in list1's heap memory with either a single or double pointer, but you can't do the same thing with a function. Why not? Yes, I understand that otherList will cause a segfault. 
 #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> struct ll{ int data; struct ll* prev; struct ll* next; }; void add(struct ll** head, int nodeData); void otherAdd(struct ll* head, int nodeData); int main() { struct ll* list1 = malloc(sizeof(struct ll)); list1->data = 83; list1->prev = NULL; list1->next = NULL; struct ll* ref = list1; struct ll** ref2 = &list1; ref->data = 17; printf("list1->data = %d\n", list1->data); // this prints 17 (*ref2)->data = 42; printf("list1->data = %d\n", list1->data); // this prints 42 // -------------------------------------------------- struct ll* otherList = NULL; add(&otherList, 5); otherAdd(otherList, 7); return 0; } void add(struct ll** head, int nodeData){ struct ll* newNode = malloc(sizeof(struct ll)); newNode->data = nodeData; newNode->prev = NULL; newNode->next = NULL; if(*head == NULL){ *head = newNode; return; } } void otherAdd(struct ll* head, int nodeData){ struct ll* newNode = malloc(sizeof(struct ll)); newNode->data = nodeData; newNode->prev = NULL; newNode->next = NULL; if(head == NULL){ head = newNode; return; } }

 If it's that, then what if go routines are explicitly mentioned in a function by us? Like, will it be goroutine (created by server for each request) be having more goroutines (created by you for your functions) managed under it???
 How does it function under the hood?

My Macbook Pro is from the year 2014.
 Apple dropped new Xcode version support a long time ago for my computer.
  
So how can I get the latest Clang working on my computer without it breaking the Xcode's native C++17 support I have working currently? I use C++17 for work so I don't want to risk breaking it. I want to somehow SAFELY get the latest C++ working in parallel with the current XCode/C++17.
 Maybe some virtual machine dedicated to compiling new C++ standard? I.e. it would have access to some folder on my computer where all the source code would be and it would also output the executable there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear fellow Rustaceans,
 Arguably the most challenging part of being a programmer is internalizing a lot of details, sometimes implicit, about the codebase you're working with. It takes significant time, even for an experienced developer, to become fully autonomous on a new project.
 I've always wanted to find a way to ease this process of memorizing the codebase, and I have also been fascinated with large language models since first learning about them. As you already guessed, my pet project is a thing that utilizes the LLMs' language understanding to answer questions about the repo you are in. As seen on the screenshot, it first scans through the code with Tree Sitter to map out the interrelations among the symbols, after that it reads through the selected source files to understand them, and then it presents its conclusion to the user.
 The key point here is that by staying in the command-line interface you do not break context. You do not have to copy-paste anything anywhere, and the conversation just flows.
 Other good questions it may help you with:
  
During what period of time were we using a vulnerable version of a certain crate?
 Who are the top three committers?
 Is there a user-wide config?
  
I very much hope someone might find this helpful as well. Any feedback is welcome, both on the code, and on the looks and feels of it:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm a mid-level SWE and this year got transferred to a team which supports internal services, one of which being the most active.
 This team consists of engineering manager & me coming from a team on which we use to own 2-3 services each, we had plenty of projects to work on and always felt useful by providing support to production ops and leading the design of new arch & features.
 Two additional new engineers were hired for this new team, one being a senior and top performer, he quickly owned the single service which is the most relevant for our PM. He has superb communication skills, so despite the size of his contributions, he always manages to get recognition from stake-holders, this wasn't the culture of my previous team, on which we were low profile and respected the ownership and expertise of other members.
 This new culture has become a bit uncomfortable as I'm not used to fight my way to lead the few projects available. One reason for this zero-sum battle with senior eng is that eng manager hasn't been that involved in team ops for months, skipping many stand-ups and 1-1s, but this hasn't caused noise to skip-manager & PM, as the team delivers anyways on those few projects.
 Part of me says that I should be happy with the light work load I'm getting here & be more focused in up-skilling while I can. But other can't get over the dread against senior eng getting all the flashlights.
 Have you been in a similar situation before? How did you cope with it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I am working on a post-apocalyptic game that includes a crafting system. You find materials, you convert them into usable items. This includes explosives, and for the most part my aim is to be realistic. There are other elements of the game- firearms, lockpicking, etc, that are already set up to be as real as possible while still being fun.
 My question is, is it illegal to include a crafting recipe for, as an example, nitroglycerine? Can I get in trouble for having a crafting recipe to turn cough syrup into amphetamines? Additionally, if the in-game crafting recipe uses household ingredients (the game is set in a city), is that potentially more legal trouble I could be inviting?
 If someone plays my game, then later creates that dangerous material for real, am I possibly culpable for them doing that, and if so do I need to purposefully obscure the references to real-world materials or even have unrealistic/fictional materials instead?
 Regardless of answers given, I aknowledge that none of the comments provided here qualify as legal counsel.

Although primarily self-taught, I also completed a few courses at a community college. After a year of learning and some freelancing, I secured my first job. Currently, in my second job, I primarily work with JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.
 Why I Want to Mentor
 During my learning journey, several individuals were extremely helpful to me, and I want to pay it forward. I thoroughly enjoy teaching and it is one of the aspects I mis…]]></summary>

 However, I was using Fedora KDE in a dual boot with Arch/xmonad. I decided to reinstall Fedora with Gnome and give it a go.
 I installed a the tiling extension Forge and a couple of other extensions.
 I thought te gnome workflow wasn't intuitive. I was wrong. I find myself using it more and more and moving seamlessly. The three finger workspace change saves a lot of time, tiling works quite nicely and I find gnome is out of my way.
 My Girlfriend was having some freezing issues with Mint so we installed Fedora / Gnome too. She got used to it in a heartbit.
 Hats off to the Gnom developers and those who have created extensions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR Turning off hyperthreading took the compile time of our GameMaker project down from 4:36 on average to 4:00 flat. That's a time savings of 13%, or a speed increase of 15%. 
 I've compiled a lot of games over the years. It always brings all cores up to a full 100% workload for almost the whole process no matter the engine. I've always suspected that, in those cases, hyperthreading might actually be slowing my computer down since it isn't needed if the cores are truly at 100% anyway, and that the computational and thermal overhead produced by hyperthreading isn't necessary in those situations. I never got around to testing it because, honestly, I figured I was probably wrong.
 I finally tested it yesterday. I have a fairly large game project in GameMaker. I cleaned and built it four times with hyperthreading still on and the average time was 4:36 (all were close). I then disabled hyperthreading in my bios and tested four more times. The average was 4:00 flat.
 This is with the following system:
 i7-12700k
 32 GB DDR4 3200
 WD_BLACK SN850 NVMe SSD
 I suspect other engines would also see a speed increase. Since compile times are a huge part of the game dev process, you might want to test the same thing using a project with your computer/engine. Even a 15% speed increase can add up, and it's free.

 I wonder how it's like for those of you who have many interests outside of programming / maths. 
 I don't have a set routine but I've got classes everyday at midday so I usually wake up around 8 -> 9am. Recently my semester just finished so I was studying for exams the entire day at the local library or finishing up on assignments.
 I'd obviously like to do more with my first year since everyone says it's the time where you have more time to do extra things outside of school. I just want to see what is working for other successful students so that I can try an implement what works for others into my routine.
 What does your daily routine look like, and how should people try to best maximize their time? 
 EDIT: People are always saying to sacrifice X or sacrifice Y on this subreddit, is it not possible to do everything with a balance ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a self taught programmer with experience in small/startup type companies. 
 I have invested heavily in self-studying data structures and algorithms, other CS topics and devops with my homelab (mainly out of interest in the topics).
 The languages I have used were PHP, Node.js/TS and rarely Golang. So most of my experience has been for small, growing, not-yet-validated companies.
 Anyway, I would like to move into more enterprise, large company jobs. Using C#.
 I have been learning C# because I noticed that most of the companies Id like to work for use it (or Java). Having learned TS a long time ago I am very impressed with C#. It's like using TS without version and dependency hell (NPM).
 My question is... besides the language difference in enterprise vs startup... what other things should I learn? 
 NB1: To be clear, I am an experienced dev so things like testing, oop, ci/cd, DI, messaging queues and scaling servers (load balancing, caching etc) I can already to. Albeit, at the startup scale level.
 NB2: Also, and I think this is important, I do have experience working in Large companies in the past (8 years in Finance for large companies) so I understand things like office culture, social dynamics, bureaucracy, networking etc. My question is more about programming and the technical of doing so at an enterprise level. 
 I am in the UK.

Be easy to work with. If you have an ego, leave it at the door. I had a few PMs and senior devs that looked down on everyone, don’t be like that. 
 
When a company says you’ll learn on the job, sometimes this means throwing you in the deep end and seeing if you can swim or drown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been developing since the 2000s. In the good old days, most SDEs seemed to follow a simple rule that worked well for everyone: if you don't need an answer right away or just conveying information, send an email; if you do need a quick response, send an instant message. That way, I could answer emails all at once, on my own time (usually a couple times a day). I'd only get a DM maybe every couple days 
 Sometime in the late 2010s, things seemed to shift, where people just used Slack for all communications. So, in any given day, I'll get several DMs throughout the day or tags, and constantly have to divert attention from focusing on coding to respond or at least decide if it needs immediate attention. It's more difficult to focus, and I find sometimes I want to log off from Slack for several hours, even if that risks missing an actual important message.
 Anyway, what I'm saying is, make email popular again. Is it just me who's noticing this?
 EDIT: See a lot of suggestions to disable notifications, but I'm not sure it's feasible. Because there are infrequent occasions where something really is more urgent. I guess the issue isn't so much Slack vs email (Slack has its advantages), but rather there's no distinction in Slack on message priority.

My LAN is on the 192.168.1.? subnet and my VPN server puts me on the 10.8.0.? subnet. So the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 in both cases
 So if I understand correctly even tho I can access and ping my NAS when I'm connected over VPN, the reason why my app is still not working over VPN is because I'm not the 192.168.1.? subnet? Instead I'm put on the 10.8.0.6 subnet?
 Edit: I have the Synology DS118 and OpenVPN running on it (server) and the GUI client (community) on my laptops, desktops.
 Edit2: My self-made app maps all the user's network drives as local drives persistently in File Explorer.

 I generally say this when people are trying to force ideas through or bypass things when I think it's unwise. I find whenever I say this people immediately back-pedal on having it their way; suddenly then they want to have a conversation on the approach and understand my perspective. The implication they will be responsible for any messes their decision might cause gets people thinking a little harder.
 do you have any go to things you can say that get people to see things from your perspective or at least reflect on their position a little bit?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I’d like to hear thoughts on InlineArray.
 I mentioned the other day that, in following the “parse, don’t validate” approach, I use a custom OUI type and custom MacAddress type. These are both based on a struct with InlineArray. I can access it as a span so it’s quite easy to use it without allocating a byte array.
 I’d like to create an IPv4Address type using this same approach, mostly for the same “parse, don’t validate” and the fact that since it’s 4 bytes it will be (very slightly) more performant.
 But mostly I’m just curious about what others may have used InlineArray for?

 I understand it's crucial for the industry or whatever but in the short term, it's just a pain for the company, which might be why no one or very very few are hiring new grads for now .
 Asking cause Ive been applying to a lot of companies and they all have different requirements across technologies that span across multiple domains and I can't just keep getting familiar with all of them. I've never worked with a real team, I've interned for a year but it's too basic and I only used 1 new framework in which I used like 10 functions.
 Edit: I read all of the comments and it was nice knowing I don't need to give up yet

So throwing her into something like a CS101 extension course wouldn't work.
 I remember hearing about Scratch a long time ago -- is that still a recommended learning path? I don't want to handicap her by having her learn some super-abstracted form of coding/gamified-coding that isn't going to actually help her do what she wants to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Mechanical sympathy", is a term attributed to Martin Thompson that means the better a developer understands the hardware, the infrastructure, and how things run, the better they will be at coding and avoiding and identifying problems down the line. Originally, the term comes from race car driving and it reflects the driver having an innate feel for the car, so they are able to 'feel' how to get the best out of it. 
 We referenced mechanical sympathy here: https://www.getambassador.io/blog/empowering-developers-with-guardrails, but we'd be curious to hear others thoughts on it.
 What do you guys think? Does it hold up in how you lead your dev teams or is it comparing apples to oranges?

 https://github.com/SrijanSriv211/AOs
 https://i.redd.it/bpng6kj8x75d1.gif
 https://i.redd.it/1ss6qmncx75d1.gif
 Originally the project was written in Python but then later I changed to C#. I also started working this as a hobby project back in 2020.
 I kept some imaginary costumers in my mind and at first tried to create a more of a dummy-like CMD clone (as I was learning C# at that time) which couldn't do really anything but then it slowly turned into something that could actually do something.
 The goal of AOs is simple. To better customize command-line along with some basic features like syntax highlighliting and autocomplete suggestions or something like that.
 Currently it only supports windows.
 I would be really happy if anyone can rip apart the code and give me some feedback on the project. I'm open for all criticism.
  
NOTE: I once posted about it from my another account and it did got a lot of well deserved criticism, specially on its README so I've spent some time (not longer than I would like to admit) to rewrite the README.

 I can see how a "heavy" object with a lot of member variables of objects and large containers takes a long time to copy - so (if only performance is considered) it makes sense turning them into pointers.
 However I'm trying to see where the line is? Does it make sense for objects containing just "a few" std::arrays/vectors of small size to also put these as (smart)pointers? Is it valid to think in terms of bytes-copied as in a smart_pointer is n bytes, the array is size() * m bytes, therefore it is faster to make the object a direct variable only if smaller than the pointer?

 I have a guy at my work who loves to die on stupid hills. He has a particular way that he likes doing things, and only wants things done that way. Sometimes his way is slightly worse, slight better, or the same outcome. It is rarely worth the time fighting over.
 Usually, I will softly push back and tell him that what he wants isn't relevant because of X, and the approaches covers X well. He will continue to fight over it and I will eventually end with "If this is important to you, I will do it. But it is not necessary because of Y."
 Is there a better way to handle this? Thanks in advance for the info.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today our game graduated from Early Access to 1.0. It took far longer than any of us thought. I remember starting out working on it back in 2014. By 2015 I’d visit this sub regularly, mainly for marketing tips. “Top 10 ways to market your indie game” type posts were my favourite.
 We launched into Early Access in December 2017 out of the long defunct Steam Greenlight programme with 18,000 wishlists. That was enough to get us to the big carousel on the front page of Steam at the time. Everything’s very different now. There are more games, better tools, so many more freely available resources like tutorials, and indies generally seem way more marketing savvy. I’m quite relieved we got in there when we did though, I think we’d struggle a lot more starting out now. It definitely still looks possible though; I’m looking forward to the next project.
 I just wanted to say thanks for the help. This sub is a great source of information, and reassurance when things aren’t going quite to plan.
 There's a little post here about how we almost didn't make the game, banging our head against the kickstarter: https://imgur.com/gallery/fArGK7j

After a couple days of research the culprit seems to have been caused by a large numbers of operations with denormalized floating-point values. I'm curious what methods are typically employed to handle / avoid these cases? For my project speed is more important than precision.

 I have a few possible answers which come to my mind; either to use your favorite langage, or because you started with one framework and had no incentive to change; or because you want nothing to do with a gui (*) ; but I suspect I might be missing the actual answers!
 (*) actually I'm myself using godot, but not the gui; because I prefer having everything defined in the code and not in a mixture of code/configs files which I personally find hard to maintain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an experienced JavaScript dev who's new to C# and is wanting to know how best to write C#. I feel like I've covered a majority of the language's features in my notes, however I'm struggling with the amount of features in the language, and which ones I should use over others i.e. constructor vs object initializer.
 For example, in the case of JavaScript, these conventions are preferred: 
  
Prefer `const` to `let` and `var`
 
Prefer `===` to `==`
 
 etc. 
 It would be great to understand similar C# ones if possible :)

 https://i.imgur.com/49Rn3HQ.jpeg
 But the weird thing is, if I just press enter the messages are getting ignored and the system boots normally anyways and all my drives are mounted and accessible. I have 6 drives, all of them seem to fail at the systemd boot screen but yet all 6 of them work just fine and I can read and write on them without issues.
 Is there a way to make this message go away, I hate pressing enter every time I cold boot.
 This issue also only happens on a cold boot, that means if my machine hasnt been used for at least a couple of hours. This message does not appear when turning off my machine and turning it on again within an hour or just rebooting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 What do you guys think on the subject? For some reason I always tried to avoid it and spawn a fixed number of worker goroutines. On the other hand, goroutine-per-item + semaphore approach often makes code simpler at the cost of repeated spawning. Am I overthinking it?
 UPD.
 Thank you for all the responses and insights! I just realized I phrased my question poorly, so I want to clarify.
 My question was about the trade-off between faster code (usually achieved with a worker pool) and simpler code (usually achieved by goroutine-per-item + semaphore).
 In both cases, the same number of goroutines are working concurrently at any given time. However, in the second case (goroutine-per-item + semaphore), goroutines are constantly being spawned and terminated, while in the first case (worker pool), the goroutines are long-lived.
 What do you usually choose? I understand it still depends on the specific use case, but I'm curious to know your opinions and personal experiences.

I've downloaded the minGW, and the other stuff, but i keep getting the errors when debugging/ running the code. for a single file program, i can get it to work when i just press "Run Code", but whenever i press "Debug/Run C/C++ file, i get errors. I've been searching on the internet , but nothing helps.
 Error's i've been getting
 Unable to start debugging. Program path 'C:\Users\user\OneDrive\desktop\ VisualStudioCode\2. termin (16.5.)\LV3_zad2.exe' is missing or invalid.
 GDB failed with message: C:\Users\user OneDrive\desktop\VisualStudioCode\2. termin (16.5.)\LV3_zad2.exe: No such file or directory.
 This may occur if the process's executable was changed after the process was started, such as when installing an update. Try re-launching the application or restarting the machine.
 or
 The preLaunchTask 'C/C++: gcc.exe build active file' terminated with exit code -1.
 If anyone knows how to solve this, i would be thankful. I've never used vs code before, so it might not be down to the program , but i might be an idiot who does not know how to use it.
 If a post like this is not allowed here, i'll delete it.

But nowadays on the newer kernel (6.9.3-arch1-1), the cpu usage spikes to 50-60%. I am just confused that if newer kernels provide better performance for only modern hardware? what would be the best to go for a lower end side (i7 7500U in my case).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: I'm pidgeonholed into DevOps because of my recent (last 5 years) of work experience. I really want to get back into actually writing software, has anyone successfully escaped and transitioned back?
  
I am so tired of YAML, managing credentials or begging someone else to do things that I can't access, dealing with code just thrown over a wall, etc... My relationship with on-call feels just shy of PTSD. And since when are developers not expected to check that their shipped code works in staging or prod anymore!?
 I have 17 years in the industry so I know I can get another job -- the problem is making sure that I find a great one. I'd love to work directly on a game (even if I did DevOps 50% of the time to be valuable) or another role contributing to open source software. My struggle is that my resume wouldn't reflect great as a recent dev and my dev skills need a bit of brushing up as I spent most of my time working with Python. The other issue is that I've always worked remotely; could not afford to move at this point even if I thought I would not be "feral" in an office environment, haha.
 Open to ideas, suggestions, or even just hearing others vent :)

 Does anyone here hate their job? Or perhaps have any coworkers who hate their jobs? What are the reasons?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My team writes a lot of shell scripts for our work (vaguely, Linux service/backend/devops stuff). The problem is half the team uses one shell (the IT default) and the other half uses a different incompatible shell with its own language. As the scripts get complicated, it's annoying to maintain the ones written in the "other" language. We even have some perl scripts from long ago that no one understands (original author is gone). So far our strategy has been "rewrite complicated things in Python", but it is a little unsatisfying for certain cases where all I really want is documentation of a sequence of commands and their arguments. What is your team's strategy?
 As a side note/complaint, I've been struggling recently with onboarding a new person who really doesn't know how to use their shell very well and refuses to use the one I'm using. I have to tell them, it's a personal choice but you have to learn on your own if you use something different than me because I can't help. Then at the same time I am asking them to read and understand our team's scripts written in multiple languages (2 shells + python), which is not a great experience for a newbie.

I have googled and chatgpted it but I haven't got a clear idea of it. If anyone can eli5 it and answer some of these questions I would be really grateful.
 Info:
  
The project is a shell. It has some basic commands which deals with files and directories.
 The course I am taking is Programming Fundamentals so the project is really simple.
  
Questions:
  
 Do I have to implement the test inside my project code?
  How long will it take to make the test harness? I only have two days.
  
If you nI will appreciate any help!
 Here is the code if it helps.

 But when I use fgets after fseek , then use printf to see what it prints, that's when it gets weird.

 At first i was doing this just for a quick test, but it ended up working so seamlessly i just stuck with it: All my apps, steam, everything work just fine, boot times are super fast, and even the displays are properly memorized.
 All i know is that on Windows when i tried this it took forever as it "re-initializes hardware", not to speak of the "Activate Windows" issue that usually happens when you switch Windows between machines.
 My setup probably works great because both my laptop and desktop have AMD GPUs.
 Anyone else have experience with a setup similar to this?
 How do you usually sync up your laptop and desktop?

 One of the things I really lack is the ability to get my projects out there and give them the best chance at providing value - for the most part I publish my work and cross my fingers.
 I'm interested to hear from the community any ways you've been able to successfully 'market' your (non profit) projects and get them into the hands of developers who will ultimately derive value from them?

 I couldn't tell if this kind of post was allowed here but I'll try and see if it gets taken down. I've got an old laptop I couldn't get into from 2014. I tried many means to bypass the password and the current method I'm using is the offline NT password and registry editor, I've gotten to the stage where the USB is running however I can't use my keyboard keys after the boot has begun, Are there any settings in the BIOS or something I'm missing that's stopping keys being unable to be used? It's getting stuck at the selection of windows partition.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, 14 months after release, my first game on Steam has 8 reviews. There is this blog post by Chris Zukowski: https://howtomarketagame.com/2022/01/25/why-your-first-10-reviews-are-the-most-important/ that explains in some depth why the number 10 is important when it comes to the number of reviews a game gets on Steam. I'd assume many here has read that article.
 To sum it up for those who haven't: the moment a game gets 10 reviews, it not only gets an "official score" (like "Mostly positive" or "Mixed") but also gets WAY more visibility on Steam for a few days.
 Now, one thing that isn't mentioned in the above article is if the "10 review-effect" is also happening when the game has already been around for a long time (like mine).
 Another gamedev told me that their game didn't get any noticeable increase in traffic when, after one year, they got their tenth review by a paying customer.
 So, I was wondering: has any small-scale dev here been in my situation, waiting for that tenth review, hoping for a boost in traffic, and then getting it/not getting it? What is the truth of the matter?

 When I right click my ListView I'm presented with the above. I don't know what that is to the left of the MenuItems, but I don't believe I asked for it, and certainly don't want it.
 I'm sure you already decrypted my questions on the fly, but what is it, and how do I get rid of it?

This member variable is returned in getUniquePtr() member function using std::move. The code compiles and executes fine and prints " do something" twice. But I am wondering how this works. Since getUniquePtr() function returns the ptr_ using move, the ownership is transferred (to a temp obj) in this case. And next call should fail. What am I missing here?

 My one complaint is that & is a really inconvenient character to have to type so often. 
 My natural habit seems to be pressing shift with my left hand and the 7 key with my right. Whereas every other programming character only seems to require one hand.
 My solution has been to setup a live template in RustRover so I just type a followed by tab and it inserts &. How do you cope? I can't be the only one with this perculiarity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I graduated with a CS degree over 3 years ago, and I've noticed a pattern in my career so far. I often end up in roles that don't involve as much coding as I'd like. Looking back, I think this might be because I wasn't as strong in answering random coding trivia questions during interviews.
 However, I'm finally happy to be in a position that involves more technical work. It's primarily focused on simple scripting and (linux/cloud) system administration tasks. While these are valuable skills, I still feel a strong desire to be more deeply involved in the technical aspects of software development (or cybersecurity if there is a decent amount of coding involved).
 So, my question is: Is it normal to crave a more technical role, even after several years in the workforce? Does my experience so far sound like a waste of time, or can the skills I've gained be applied to more technical positions?
 Adding on to this, what I'm noticing is that when I do apply to more technical roles now (although not a crazy amount), I seem to be getting rejected with no interview, which is what scares me. I know the job market is bad, and I'm concerned I may be stuck in my current role longer than I should be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 I've recently completed revisions to several of my CLI based ebooks, so I thought I'd post an update here. Here's the book list:
  
Linux Command Line Computing (Linux command line tools and Shell Scripting for beginner to intermediate level users)
 CLI text processing with GNU grep and ripgrep
 CLI text processing with GNU sed
 CLI text processing with GNU awk
 Perl One-Liners Guide
 Ruby One-Liners Guide
 CLI text processing with GNU Coreutils (commands like head, tail, cut, tr, pr, paste, sort, uniq, comm, join, split, etc)
  
These books have hundreds of examples and plenty of exercises to help test your understanding. The books on grep/sed/awk also include a comprehensive chapter on regular expressions.
 All my books are free to read online, see https://github.com/learnbyexample/scripting_course#ebooks for links. Markdown source and example files are available in the respective GitHub book repos.
 I've also written interactive TUI apps for some of the exercises from these books. See https://github.com/learnbyexample/TUI-apps for installation instructions. For example, if you have pipx installed, use pipx install awkexercises for the app shown below:
 Screenshot from TUI app for Awk exercises
 I would highly appreciate it if you'd let me know how you felt about my books. It could be anything from a simple thank you, pointing out a typo, mistakes in code snippets, which aspects of the book worked for you (or didn't!) and so on. Reader feedback is essential and especially so for self-published authors.
 Happy learning :)

 Often time this happens when I am debugging code someone else wrote and I am trying to pinpoint where a certain change is happening. 
 The issue is when I step into a macro or move to the next instruction in GDB it just executes the entire macro block, so if a bug happens in that particular block I have no way to see what happened inside the macro. 
 Is that just a problem I have to live with and accept the fact you cannot debug macros easily or are there some techniques that can help solve these kinds problems?

 I've searched for subs aimed at UK developers, but I've not come across any. Therefore, I've decided to create /r/ukdevs.
 My goal is for the community to be aimed at working developers who are based in the UK to talk about experiences, problems, the job market, contracting, etc. It's not really aimed at people who are learning to program for the first time - hence I thought there might be some in this sub who are interested, due to a similar audience.
 Mods (/u/snowe2010 , /u/drewsiferr, /u/teerre), I wonder if it would be possible to have this community listed in the related subs section of the sidebar?

 public interface IFile { int Id { get; set; } // ... }
 public class Model : IModel { /.../ } public class File : IFile { /.../ } `` ModelandFile` classes are classes that are going to be used with ef core, for example. They are relatively simple POCO, nothing particular, except for that interface.
 Now, if we want to use these classes in a MVVM environment, we'd need to turn them into observableobjects or implement INotifyPropertyChanged somehow. So we could do exactly that, manually, but that would require a lot of bloat code.
 We could use Fody, Castle, or Postsharp... But let's say we don't want to use these.
 Would the following be a pretty good idea or an absolutely terrible monstruosity?
  /// Turns the obj of class T implementing the corresponding interface IT into a fully observableobject public T AsObservable<T>(this T obj) { /*...*/ } 
 For example, you could do this:  var file = new File{/*...*/}; var model = new Model{/*...*/}; var obsfile = file.AsObservable<IFile>(); var obsmodel = model.AsObservable<IModel>(); obsmodel.Files.Add(obsfile); // At this point, obsmodel.Files contains obsfile and model.Files contains file 
 What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a problem where a 'thing' can be identified by or associated with many different types of data, and for each data type it has a specific value that no other 'thing' can have. For example, consider cli flags where one 'option' can be represented by a short form flag eg -h and a long form flag eg --help.
 I have created a struct that contains one element for each data type that can represent the 'thing'. What I would like to do is create a collection of these structs that enforces the uniqueness of each member of each struct. In other words, within this collection, no two structs can have the same value for member A, member B, member C etc. 
 Another key detail is that this collection needs to be created at the beginning of the program, but after that will not be modified. Whether this effects what solutions are available to me I'm not sure, but thought it worth mentioning.
 Does anyone have any suggestions for how to achieve this? I've been stumped for a few hours trying to get this sort of behaviour with an unordered set, but I just keep running into issues so I'm stumped. Is std::undordered_set the correct tool for this? Can this be achieved with a collection at all? Is there some other mechanism by which this can be achieved?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am still in college, and learning. I have finished all my programming introduction courses, and data structures course which all used c++. I now have elective options available to tackle other languages and they are more niche classes. However, I am interested in game development, so the plan as of now is to go into graphics programming and classes that involve that. I already mess around in sfml, but I would like to learn SDL or even OpenGL, which I am hoping is what it covers. Anyways, having options now to go into web development courses and what not has me wondering how c++ can interact with other language scripts? Like python for instance, surely I cannot just ifstream Example.py and it just works. So keeping it simple in hello world terms, if I had a python script that just prints hello, is there any way to interact with that and display Hello World in the c++ console? (With world coming from c++ code)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I try to create a type trait, usable in if constexpr to find out whether I can call an std::function<void(T const&> without any U being implicitly converted to T const& .
 This obviously evaluates to true and compiles:
 static_assert(std::is_invocable_v< std::function<void(bool const &)>, bool const& >);
 This also evaluates to true, because an int can be implicitly converted to a bool - I want it to evaluate to false:
 static_assert(std::is_invocable_v< std::function<void(bool const &)>, int const& >);
 Same for those:
 static_assert(std::is_invocable_v< std::function<void(bool const &)>, int & >);
 static_assert(std::is_invocable_v< std::function<void(bool const &)>, int >);
 Any ideas how I could improve this?
 Background:
 I implemented an observer pattern using std::variant and std::visit where the subscribers register an std::function in order to subscribe for a type. The type is the const& argument of the std::function.
 I only want to notify the observer, when it registered to exactly this type without any implicit conversion. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, I was implementing a more complex dialogue system than the one I was using for testing so far. I made it so the dialogues correlates to the active quests, so that each character, if involved in several quests, can deliver their lines according to the current step in the quest. All that using only one concatenated id as input for the DialogueManager.
 And I was sooooo happy seeing that damn data displayed on the screen with the new system. The whole process of designing the system (i.e scribbling in a notebook where data is and should go) and coding it was super fun to me.
 And I often read/hear fellow devs talking about it as the "unfun" or "not sexy" part of the trade, and I don't know I kind of love it, even making option menus and save systems.
 What do you think about these tasks?

 About a year ago, I was tapped by my manager to work on integrating a new platform into our product offering. Without going into too much detail, it's a platform that should replace all our bespoke 3rd-party integrations and replace it with just one set of APIs. Obviously it's a huge task to be taken on by a single developer, especially if it spans multiple parts of our existing system.

However, I am running into issues after install. I have tried two different types of install (1) graphical install with KDE Plasma installation & other prerequisites as part of standard install and (2) graphical install BUT unticking everything except for "standard system utilities". The issue is whether I choose to install KDE Plasma Task via graphical install or install KDE standard via command line, I can't boot into the default kernel running 6.1.0-21-amd64 and gives me a out of memory error. But if I choose Advance Options in grub menu and choose kernel running 6.1.0-18-amd64, I can boot into Debian with no issues. Question - how do I make sure grub menu always selects the 6.1.0-18 kernal and I don't keep having to go Advance Options and manually select it. TIA

My system has a Ryzen 7 7700 (non-X) CPU, ASRock RX 6600 (non-XT) GPU, and ASRock A620 mini-ITX motherboard. I used the Debian 12.5 netinst with default kernel 6.1.0-21-amd64, and selected LXDE as my desktop environment.
 About 10 seconds after the login screen came up the screen froze; and about 30-40 seconds later the computer rebooted itself into a black screen (no video output from the GPU nor integrated graphics from the CPU). This occured consistently regardless of whether or not I was able to log in. I'm sure this was related to the GPU because when I plugged the HDMI into the motherboard to use the CPU's integrated graphics, the computer didn't crash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, when I was writing and reading articles revealing the secrets of the STL kernel, I found that the wait_until interface calls chrono, and I found that the implementation of chrono by gcc and clang is inconsistent. This can easily mislead us during development and cause some hidden bugs.
 system_clock Default Time Units in Different Compilers.
 GCC (g++-13)
 In GCC, the default time unit for system_clock is nanoseconds (std::chrono::nanoseconds). This is defined as follows:
 struct system_clock { typedef chrono::nanoseconds duration; }; 
 Clang
 In Clang, the default time unit for system_clock is microseconds (std::chrono::microseconds). It is defined as:
 class _LIBCPP_TYPE_VIS system_clock { public: typedef microseconds duration; }; 
 This discrepancy means that when compiling the same code with different compilers, the precision and behavior of time calculations can vary.
 But steady_clock is indeed consistent.

The problem we are having is the devs are wanting to test their changes by deploying to AWS dev environment before merging to main which i think is creeping into feature based branching strategy.
 Any best practices here? Should testing (CI) be improved on the Pull Request step to reduce the need to deploy before merging to main? Or has anyone seen workflows where each dev has their own cloud environment to work on? What else should i consider?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a fan of Project Amber's work for the Java language.
 Project Amber made it very clear that the most effective way to help out is by trying out Preview features in a(n ideally, nontrivial) project, and then posting feedback to the mailing lists. I've made it a point to do that for every Amber feature (minus the ones still in Preview that I haven't caught up to yet).
 However, Primitive Patterns is probably the first time where I genuinely struggle to come up with a project that can use these in a non-trivial way. I tried cycling through some different ideas, like Math games, some tool that does quantizing, and more.
 So this is me querying for ideas -- what project ideas make sense to help test Primitive Patterns?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Reddit, i wanted to make this update por a long time. Since the original post, lots of thing have happened. I'm discussing internaly the idea of creating a blog about it.
 For a quick recap, i'm a Network Engineer / Programmer that is leading a big Linux corporate migration at Policia Militar de Minas Gerais in Brazil. Our custom Ubuntu 22.04 distro is named "Guara" and were officially released yesterday. Guara has lots of custom and opensource software developed for the corporation needs, and aims to replace 22K PCs around the Minas Gerais state. In the first phase, we plan to replace 800 machines running an older Debian distros with mate desktop. This will be our first large scale test, as i write this post Guara is already running in 215 machines. In the second phase we plan to replace Windows 7 and 8 machines. To make the transition smoother we're also creating a series of small tik-tok tutorial videos, teaching basics for end users. Just for a quick note, here are our distro highilights:
  
Ubuntu 22.04.4 based (24.04 already in the works)
 Onlyoffice 8.0
 Google Chrome
 Linphone as voip client
 Droidcam to use smartphones as webcams
 Some proprietary java applications
 Guara-updater 
 Custom application developed for Guara.
 Automaticlally push custom configs at system boot
 
 Guara Installer 
 Custom application created for Guara.
 Inventory the system and run initial scripts
 
 Argos Network Center 
 Custom application created to test system components
 Test network conectivity
 Set http proxy for all the system (browser, cli and electron apps)
 Remote access with dynamic passwords (like teamviewer)
 
  
We plan to open to project and release all the code as opensource, also create a reference documentation for a corporate linux migration with real world effort and dificulties along the way.
 Here is our special launch video, hope you like it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a few C++ projects that after a certain point I basically got stuck due to "analysis paralysis" or caught up in object-oriented architectural details instead of focusing on just making things work.
 C++ and the STL offer just so many different tools and object-oriented ways to do the same thing as opposed to C that's mostly a barebones structured language.
 Of course, if you want you can always use C++ without any object orientation, you can also do things "simply" while using C++, it's just a matter of making that decision and sticking to it throughout the duration of the project. And for me that's the problem, if I'm not forced to do things in a simple way, I know that at some point I will give in to the temptation and start using containers, templates, class hierarchies, etc. The only way to "force" myself to do things in a simple manner, is to just use C instead.
 Anybody else relates to this?

 How do I even debug this or see what's raising the event? Is there anything general I should look at?

 I contributed to a fairly popular Rust crate on GitHub, but right before merging my PR, the maintainer copied my commits into a different branch (under his name and commit messages), closed my PR without merging, but merged his branch as a separate PR. Essentially, he made it look like he wrote the code himself but as far as I can tell it's verbatim what I wrote.
 Is this normal? Am I wrong to be upset?

 Could really use some sound advice right now.
 I'm really lost right now, cannot land a job. I have 4 and a half years experience in the industry but sadly my graduate job for 4 years mainly focused on a niche software with some c# development but a lot of samey stuff with no code reviews/guidence so my coding skills stagnated. I landed a really good job after leaving but was made redundant and now basically 8 months later I can't land a job.
 I feel I'm in an awkward spot, as I technically have 4 years experience but my coding skill does not reflect that. Also really struggle with working from home with productivity and low moods - really need an office based job.
 Just looking for some advice on how to proceed. Do I aim for the scarce junior jobs or go for lower end mid level? Confidence is low and have major imposter syndrome. 
 What would you recommend coding in my spare time/what technology should I focus on? Is there a good website with challenges to do? I just feel so lost and really don't want to give up a career in tech and work in retail. Also doesn't help that the indurstry has basically crashed right now.
 Sorry for the rant, appreciate any advice.

 Some people argued that's for security, some others said it's for performance reasons
 Can people explain to me why this is? So for example if I put, say, some powershell in my C# app, and it works, and the rest of the app is all C#, how does that potentially make my app less secure than if it only relied on native API calls?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my program, I have something like the below...
 int * func()
 {int * Ihatepointers=(int *)malloc(sizeof(int)*69);
 Ihatepointers[1]=400;
 return Ihatepointers;
 }
 int main()
 {func();
 }
 The problem is that once the function ends, I can't free the pointer, but if I free the pointer before the return, my return has bad data. I can always use a conditional value into the function, where one side frees and the other returns the pointer, but it's a bit cumbersome. I think you could also set the returned value to another pointer in the main function, then free the pointer that way? Are there any better ways of freeing the local pointer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i have been trying to figure out how the debian packaging process works but i cannot figure out how it all fits together. manpages for all the fragments are somewhat good but there is very little documenting how it fits together.
 i've read the manpages in dpkg-dev, developer documents at debian.org and some of the manpages which come with dh.
 my goal is to understand what is happening and why, i think i understand debian/control and debian/changelog but i am stuck at how to use all the fragments in the debian/rules file.
 apologies if i am just having a hard time finding or putting together the documentation if its present. links or anything else that may help would be greatly appreciated
 to clarify i am not against using debhelper, but i like to understand what tools do and why before i use them

 It seems as though if you have a bunch of if/else, and you keep needing to add more, then you can just put the predicates in a List of Tuples where the first item is the predicate, and the second is the value you want to return, or it could be an Action or a Func<T>.
 What do you like to use and are there any cons to using a List of Tuple?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have some labs to finish for my certification training. Lab are in a localhost environment. Course is about WEB vulns, and I need to use BurpSuite and FoxyProxy.
 When both Foxy and burp are on, and the intercept on, pages won't load. The thing is that everything is correctly configured, like 127.0.0.1 port 8080, no exceptions on both Foxy/Burp. CA Port Swigger Certificate in place.
 But pages won't load, or they will load without interception. The worse thing is that my localhost page refuses to load when Foxy and Intercept are functioning, because my Labs are on localhost page, and I can't even have access to my labs.
 I tried and configured everything possible, I even changed ports to try. I also tried on seceral browsers : same thing. I updated/upgraded, restarted. Nothing. Tried with BurpSuite's built-in browser (Chromium) : same.
 I'm stuck for 1 (full) day and can't fin a solution. I always had some trouble with Foxy/Burp in the past except 1 time where it worked fine.
 I need to keep the intercept on because it's a part of my labs.
 Worse, when I decide to put the intercep off and stop foxy I have to restart my VM to get internet functioning.
 I can't work on my very last labs, and I'm afraid about my cert exam.
 Please do you have a solution ? An alternative ?

 I have HTML and CSS as runtime variables in my project, which I would like to pass to a renderer that can then render to PDF, but possibly be used for other rendering purposes (maybe other file formats). 
 Most headless browsers are great for this, but they are setup to scrape online websites. The extra features built in for networking and javascript are cumbersome (binary size problems), and I haven't found one that can simply be passed HTML without having to direct it to a URL. I could spin up a local web server to serve the headless browser a local webpage using my HTML and CSS, but that is extremely cumbersome. 
 I essentially need just a web renderer without the browser, or just a really lightweight headless browser that can be passed straight HTML. 
 Any suggestions for packages/librariesa or methods to achieve this? I may have to build it myself (advice appreciated for that too), but it'd be nice to have a shortcut of some sort.

 I want to optimize away this mutex, so I thought if I could make the allocator thread local instead of static.
 In this case, when exactly does each thread local version of the allocator get created? When each thread calls the allocator ?

 So, up to this point, everything's copacetic. Then I want to do this:
 static const uint16_t MY_ARRAY_RAW[] = { DATA_0.raw, DATA_1.raw, DATA_2.raw, }; 
 and suddenly, my static const array initializer elements are no longer compile-time constants. How's come?
 If the compiler can figure out that MY_ARRAY[] = { 0xFF00, 0x7F7F, 0x00FF }, why can't it figure out that MY_ARRAY_RAW is the exact same thing? I can't even try to recast my DATA_# objects to uint16_t, whether I pull the raw member or not. The whole point of the MY_STRUCT() macros is to provide a compile-time, static, constant object constructor for complex data types. What's the point if I can't use compile-time, static, constant data as compile-time, static, constant data?
 Of course, my actual my_struct_t's inner anonymous struct is much more complicated than this, but the syntax is the same.

 I visited Russia yesterday and found out that the most paid VPN services I used - NordVPN, Surfshark are now banned. Both WireGuard and OpenVPN, even manual setup. I used to say that they wouldn't do it, because many businesses depend on private VPNs and it would break too much, but they seem to be doing it successfully. I had my job VPN working without issues the whole time. I was able to find some less known services in GooglePlay, but it was tricky.
 Are they just banning IPs or there is something else? What if I set up my own VPN service and use it alone, is there a high chance that it may be banned too?

 Now of course I could add it as an exception in my AV's database but that's a PITA I think especially you know it's not supposed to happen to begin with

It took me about 2.5 years from when I started learning programming to land a job as a software developer. I accepted my offer and started working this past March, so it's been about 3 months now.
 So in 2021, motivated by the TikTok videos (yes, sorry guys, I really got attracted by these day in the life videos lol), I decided to start a second degree in CS, right when the industry was really really hot. I finished my CS degree in the summer of 2023, which, ironically, was right when the job market went to shit. Since I was juggling work and school, I couldn't do an internship, but I did complete a 3-month bootcamp, thanks to a sch…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My team and I had a debate, so I wanted to get an outside perspective
 a function like this
 std::pair<std::string, std::string> fun() { const std::string someStr = getSomeString(); std::string someStr2 = getSomeOtherString(); fun1(someStr, someStr2); fun2(someStr, someStr2); fun3(someStr, someStr2); return std::pair<std::string, std::string>(someStr, someStr2); } 
 was changed to
 std::pair<std::string, std::string> newFun() { std::string someStr = createSomeString(); std::string someStr2 = createSomeString(); fun1(someStr, someStr2); fun2(someStr, someStr2); fun3(someStr, someStr2); return std::make_pair(std::move(someStr), std::move(someStr2)); } 
 I originally wrote this up giving my position and why, but I don't want to bias the responses. I will just say I like the change a lot, the only thing I disagreed with is removing the const qualifier from someStr
 Some notes:
 it was not a know hot spot / performance issue
 we dont know the length of the string but could possibly be <= 16 characters
 Thoughts? Do you think it is worth dropping const to make a string movable?
 edit: formatting

 Wondering if any one else feels the same?
 FWIW I primarily build enterprise web applications; taking data, transforming data, and presenting data.

 Ik i can install arch without any fkery of fking up the home directory and straight up just formatting the root and boot partition but I just need a second and third person opinion for doing so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a consulting firm and I work with a junior engineer* who likes to waffle when he is presenting his work or when he needs to answer a question.
  
he is junior as a software engineering but has work experience in corporate setting in different role
  
Today we had to give a company wide presentation and he had to do a demo.
 His demo should have taken 5 minutes, but it took him 20min. I noticed that half of the people left during his part as he was yapping.
 I think one reason for this is his lack of understanding of the topic he is presenting, thus he is using a lot of filler words and buzzwords just to keep talking. I actually emphasise with that as I sometimes do that if i am not confident in what I am presenting, but not to that extent.
 Yapping also happens often during client calls when he needs to explain his work. It is evident that clients get confused, but everyone is polite and just lets him talk.
 Have you had experience with dealing with people like this. How do you provide feedback so it doesn’t sound accusatory. I don’t feel comfortable with providing feedback out of the blue as he doesn’t report to me. Perhaps I shouldn’t care about it in the first place, but I do find this behaviour irritating 
 In the next feedback cycle I will write a feedback saying that this person would benefit from learning how to be more concise in the meetings. A good approach would be to record a demo and watch it back and answer the question “if I was watching this demo on youtube for learning purposes, would I find it engaging”. But this sounds little bit too obnoxious.

 are there more modern books or resources anyone knows about?
 I am a little hesitant to delve too deep on this subject because it seems to have less relevance to modern hacking but you never know I suppose, and this subject seems to be foundational to all computing and therefore hacking itself

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I hope this is ok to post. I am a penetration tester, and I have a specific requirement right now for my job. My team is currently doing security-requirement evaluation, and there is a requirement that talks about performing HTTP fuzzing on a device that does not act as a server; it is a bad requirement essentially.
 There is some belief within the team that we could try to fuzz one of the shared libraries (.so) that handles some of the lower-level HTTP logic, but it does not house code that is used for routing or anything like that.
 Personally, I'm not convinced that such a fuzzing tool even exists for this type of use case, but I want to make sure I cover my bases before discussing again within the team. I've spent ample time researching, and could not find anything pertinent.
 My question is, does anyone have any knowledge of such a tool? The use case is specifically HTTP binary fuzzing; not HTTP server fuzzing, and not general binary fuzzing.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fellow Rustaceans! We are excited to announce pgml, our official Rust SDK for PostgresML, and the rust_bridge, the crate we the crate we utilize to generate our JavaScript, Python, and now C SDKs from our Rust SDK.
 We have had the SDK available on GitHub for a while now, but this marks its official release on crates.io. 
 Maybe more interesting for some of the community is the rust_bridge crate (docs still in progress). The rust_bridge exposes a series of macros and traits that can be implemented to translate vanilla Rust into py03, neon, and C compatible Rust. For those interested we have a writeup on How We Generate JavaScript and Python SDKs From Our Canonical Rust SDK. We recently added C into the rust_bridge and are working on interop with additional runtimes, like Go, JVM, and Beam.
 We wanted to thank the community for all the effort that gets put into OpenSource Rust and are hoping that our contributions will be helpful!
 Let us know if you have any questions, stay awesome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello, i hope you have a great day.
 i was wondering how would you structure your file application in such a situation (which is standard, i suppose)
 For the context, this is a particle simulator.
 I have a class Mview and a class Model. Model include a class World, a class Wordable and a class Particle
 World is just the dimensions of the world
 Wordable is a class object that is on the grid (the word), so this class manage forces, acceleration speed position and collision. Wordable is never instantiated, so this is an abstract or virtual class (if i understand correctly) Particle is one child class of Wordable , i have severals Wordable chidren because i can have different type of particle like a particle with a mass or not (photon for example), another particle class with other parameters (like TTL) and so on,
 For the coordinates system i use broadly a very simple struct Vec2D { float x; float y; auto get2D(return sf::Vector2f{x,y} -> sf::Vector2f; (get2D is used because i draw with SFML)
 i was wondering where to put this Struct ?
 at this time this struct is in particle.h. wordable.h include particle.h
 model.h include wordable.h 
 mview.h include model.h 
 main.cpp include mview. 
 first i dont really like this because everything is included also where it's not used/ Second, if i have two or more derived classes of Wordable, i ll have to copy the struct definition in all derived classes, or create a new file with just the struct and include it in all derived classes.
 but it sounds tedious and i multiply definitions for nothing. 
 What would be your strategy ? 
 i'm a beginner, about 1 years of C++ but i have played a lot with classes in php and js in another life

 I’ve been working on a lightweight .NET State Machine Workflow called FlowCiao, designed to simplify creating and managing business processes. It functions similarly to state machines and has an easy-to-use, fluent API. For instance, you can set up a ticketing system with states like "New", "In Progress", and "Closed" pretty easily.
 We also have a Server and Visual Designer Interface to make workflow setup smoother. We're just getting started and would love to hear any feedback or suggestions you might have. Thanks for checking it out! this is the repository

 It's pretty inconsequential so just not saying anything is an option too, but it would bug me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have read a book called "Hackers and Painters", in which there is a point of view that hackers and painters are very similar, and writing code is very similar to painting, both are an artistic creation process, which requires constant redesign and redesign. In the English context, programming is art, it is the composition of program, and it shares the same word with literature and music, compose, but I have been self-studying programming for a year, and I still don't feel the connection between programming and art so far, I only feel that algorithm problem are a headache. I'd like to ask all my fellow redditors questions: What does elegantly structured code look like? How it's elegant?
 Maybe it is a question too general to answer. I just want to find some motivation for myself to keep going.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a recently promoted senior engineer and I believe I'm pretty much failing at the "directly responsible individual" thing because the feature I'm responsible for has just way too many parts(multiple backend codebases that need to be in sync because we're migrating from one system to another), plus multiple clients(ios, android, web) that have to all agree with the two backend systems, and the business logic can get very, very complicated too.
 I am expected to personally deliver on the backend bits, as well as keep track of everyone's progress, break their work into chunks, do feature-wide estimations(so it's not good enough to say "the backend part will be ready by date X", I have to give estimates on the feature as a whole). I don't think I've been doing a very good job so far, but this is the first time I'm shouldering so much stuff at the same time.
 In fact I've never had to be directly responsible for the complete feature(incl. front-end) before, it was always just the backend code for me.
 My team lead has stepped in at this point because I just couldn't hack it.
 I'm also not entirely sure that this is what I imagined a senior engineer role to be like. I expected to stay in my lane(backend engineering) but just do more of it, handle more complicated backend problems, mentor more junior backend devs, coordinate between multiple backend teams - and I HAVE been doing all of that relatively successfully; but I never expected to have to sit down with a client dev and break their work into chunks and estimate it.
 What's going on? Is it even normal that I'm doing all this?

 As I'm becoming a more advanced programmer in general (with other languages), I more and more feel like my C# knowledge isn't thorough enough.

But then I come over to write something in straightforward C# .NET and realise some of the basics elude me. I've done a bit of OOP in Java through uni years that I'm now super rusty with and don't understand the syntax of in C#. I do understand classes and what you can do with them pretty well, but moreso as an add-on to a procedural approach.

 Any ideas why convenience methods weren't added to cover the compareTo >= 0 and compareTo <= 0 cases?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you should know, getting a reference (shared or exclusive) to a "static mut" will probably end up as a compile time error in 2024 edition.
 Like a lot of people, I use "static mut" for global state. I never really thought about why "static mut" is whacky.
  
If my program is single thread, why do I need to synchronize the access of a "static mut" ? After all, no race condition can happen.
 
Why Rust force me to use "unsafe" to touch this "static mut" ?
 
 The reason is aliasing : if you use "static mut" in a way that end up with more than 1 exclusive reference, this is undefined behavior.
 The compiler assume only 1 exclusive reference to a memory location can exist at any point in time. "static mut" give you the power to get as many exclusive reference you want (by using "unsafe").
 Even if you think you can manage this, this can be very surprising and result in ugly code.
 1st, you'll have to use "unsafe" at any time you touch the "static mut".
 2nd, if you store an exclusive reference of the "static mut" on the stack (temporary or function argument), you can't have another one unless the first one lifetime end.
 3rd, you'll have to shorten the lifetime yourself by using block {} or function call.
 4th, even using a shared reference forbid you to have an exclusive reference somewhere.
 It's very easy to forgot you have already one reference of the "static mut" in-use inside your call-stack (upper), and the compiler doesn't say anything because all access of the "static mut" are gate behind "unsafe". The same problem happen in multi-thread with Mutex : if you have one lock in your call-stack, and you try to lock the same Mutex again, it's probably a deadlock. One could consider it's a programmer error and you should respect the invariant, I don't know what to say about that.
 What are your favorite alternative ? OnceCell, OnceLock. UnsafeCell, SyncUnsafeCell, RefCell, Arc<Mutex>, Rc<RefCell>, std::ptr::addr_of_mut! ?

For Godot, the upcoming update will introduce full support for the GDScript language, including the ability to debug. We’re aiming to maintain the compatibility with the existing community-driven plugin. Last but not least, the Godot support plugin is set to be bundled with Rider in the 2024.2 release.
  
This is fantastic news, and more proof that Godot is well on the way to being acknowledged as a first class engine alongside the usual Unity & Unreal duo.
 PS: Jetbrains IDE are paid software but the EAP (early access program) will allow you to use the early access version for free! More info here: https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/nextversion/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Found out about it yesterday by mistake, same day as the meeting. 4 out of 10 in the team, and it's obviously been kept under wraps. We recently had an incident in which the incredibly incompetent scrum master screamed at some of our team members, yet for some reason both the PO and the PL not only keep the wanker on, but he's also in this meeting.
 Meanwhile, I am known within the organization as the problemsolver and for working hard, and I sincerely believe that the entire team has input well worth taking into consideration. 
 Literally the only thing that they would have to do in order to achieve minimum effort would have been "we're doing this planning meeting, please put forth your opinions suggestions and recommendations". Instead, more than half of the people involved in this meeting are either bad or completely incompetent at their jobs.
 I am honestly furious about this - I've worked very hard for the last ten months to get the platform into a usable state. I have a 1on1 with the PL tomorrow, and I'm feeling like I'm about to do a rage quit. 
 Would really appreciate some input on how to handle this - I really don't like to feel angry.

 Should it broadly be folder-based i.e. each file in a particular folder has the same namespace? Do you have one namespace per "feature"? Do you give a each file it's own unique namespace?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 I just started working in a company that uses C# and I haven't used the language professionally before.
 While reading the docs I noticed that there is a static method for ArgumentNullException to quickly do a Null-Check. (ThrowIfNull)
 I was wondering, why there is only an exception as well as a null-check static method for arguments but not for values in general?
 I mean I could easily use the ArgumentNullException for that, but imo that is bad for DX since ArgumentNullException is implying that an argument is null not a value of a variable.
 The only logical reason I can come up with is, that the language doesn't want to encourage you to throw an exception when a value is null and rather just have a normal null-check, but then I ask myself why the language encourages that usage for arguments?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unlike regular hash functions, so-called perfect hash functions guarantee that no collisions ever happen, that is, every two distinct keys map to different hash values, which allows for the construction of hash tables with strict O(1) performance. This seemingly impossible feat comes with the tradeoff that the set of elements must be known in advance prior to table initialization. In this talk we'll review the basics of perfect hashing theory, explain some of the most common algorithms found in the literature, review some C++ perfect hashing libraries and learn how perfect hashing can be used to improve the efficiency of our programs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not a big thing really, but i thought i'd share.
 Part of my job is running Updates on customer systems with ansible. The includes 2 things: "Initiate" the Update by selecting an environment to work with (this ensures you don't have to attach the -i flag to every ansible-playbook command) and then running 4-6 playbooks. Additionally, i do "custom" rollouts with any subset out of 30 or so playbooks, which are all contained in a folder.
 I was growing tired of having to type the path to customer inventorys and autofilling playbook names. This is tedious and with playooks often having similar names, i tended to have to type them out almost completely.
 So today, i spend a grand total of 20 minutes putting together two scripts that pipe either the environments or playbooks into fzf and the runs the needed command. So i now get interactive fuzzy search through our customers and playbooks. All of that without having to get a software approved by IT and all done in 10 lines of bash total.
 This then also made me realize i can just push my entire ssh config with some grep and filtering into fzf to get an interactive "ssh launcher".
 So really, 30 minutes spend wipping up 3 scripts that will now make my job easier and nicer every day. And that's possible because so many awesome tools are made to "just work" with each other through text input and output. That's why i love working on Linux every day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://godbolt.org/z/1a51Yeqsz
 I want to generate a class/struct as follows: ```
 define CREATE_SAMPLE_CLASS(name, type1, name1, type2, name2) \
 class name##s { \ public: \ struct name { \ type1 name1{}; \ type2 name2{}; \ }; \ \ void addsample(const name &s) { \ this->name1##.pushback(s.name1); \ this->name2##.pushback(s.name2); \ } \ \ [[nodiscard]] name operator[](const std::size_t idx) const noexcept { \ return name{ name1##[idx], name2##[idx] }; \ } \ \ const std::vector<type1> &get##name1() const noexcept { return name1##; } \ const std::vector<type2> &get##name2() const noexcept { return name2##; } \ \ private: \ std::vector<type1> name1##{}; \ std::vector<type2> name2##_{}; \ };
 CREATE_SAMPLE_CLASS(test, int, foo, char, bar) ```
 In this case, the class/struct generation is hardcoded for only two members. However, currently I've cases with up-to 7 members. Has anybody an idea, how I can generate a struct as above without having to implement the macro for all numbers of members separately? I'm currently using C++17. Best case would be without third-party libraries but this isn't a strict criterion.
 The current usage is together with a C API like so:
 ``` tests samples{};
 tests::test s{}; my_c_api_function(&s.foo); my_other_c_api_function(&s.bar); samples.add_sample(s); ``` I'm saving the samples in struct of arrays format since thats the format I later need after gathering all samples.

I've been working here for 3 years and have continued to do 60 hour weeks every week (unless I take sick time). Crunch time is easily 80 hours or more. I am mid level but not senior yet and now considering leaving/ dialing it back.
 I'm applying aggressively, I know the job market is hard. But I had some health stuff arise and have saved a cushion to land on.
 I'm wondering how common this is for other folks? And for more context: I don't code in my role, I love programming. I want to go back to programming and making cool things/ having pride in my work and ownership in the things I work on. I am more like high level analysis. 
 If you left a toxic job-which did not respect boundaries or time off for no real reason- what did you do after? What did you learn from it and what advice would you give someone trying to stick it out in such a hard job market right now?

 I'm quite ashamed to post here as I know this is ancient and probably should be thrown away by now. It is a 12-year-old computer. I feel bad about the situation that I cannot really afford anything better now. I was wondering if I can still use this computer with Arch Linux for office work, browsing, and coding.

 I saw with the %* in scanf(), you can skip the current input, and point to the next input. But after I wrote a program want to abuse this technique, it doesn't work as expect.
 AnyName.c
 include <stdio.h>
 int main()
 {
 int i_a;
 char s_sentence[11];
 signed char c_b;
 unsigned char c_d;
 printf("Plz enter a decimal integer with suppress argument \*: \\n"); scanf("%\*d %d", &i\_a); printf("You input two decimal integers, but we only take the second one as your input: %d\\n",i\_a); printf("Plz enter a string no longer than 10 characters without space: \\n"); scanf("%10s",&s\_sentence); printf("You enter a string, but we only takes first 10 characters no matter what: %s\\n",s\_sentence); printf("Plz enter a signed char and an unsigned char as integer between -127 to 128 and 0 to 255: \\n"); scanf("%\*hhd %hhd%\*hhu %hhu", &c\_b, &c\_d); printf("You signed char and unsigned char have integer values as: %hhd %hhu\\n", c\_b,c\_d); 
 }
 Console:
 Plz enter a decimal integer with suppress argument *:
 12
 12
 You input two decimal integers, but we only take the second one as your input: 12
 Plz enter a string no longer than 10 characters without space:
 io
 You enter a string, but we only takes first 10 characters no matter what: io
 Plz enter a signed char and an unsigned char as integer between -127 to 128 and 0 to 255:
 1
 1
 2
 2
 You signed char and unsigned char have integer values as: 0 2
 I don't know why the first signed char is 0? Can somebody help, really appreciate for the advice!

 I wonder if i can find a simple and useful Memory Cache in C++.
 I always use std::map to be a memory cache, it's useful and easily.
 But sometimes std::map is not enough to deal with the problem, so I had to coding for more function.
 Can I find a lib or tools jut like "Redis lite" in C++?
 I hope the memory cache comes with advanced features such as timers and queues.
 I hope the memory cache is thread safe.
 Clustering and data persistence features like Redis are unnecessary.

 Recently I've released a version for usage, its still in early development and new features are added very frequently. I would love to get feedback, criticism and even just straight up roasting, every kind of feedback is welcome. 
 I've added a preview of how it looks like right now. Let me know your thoughts!
 here is the repo link, if you could take your time to leave a start I would really appreciate.

 So I decided that I wanted to learn C, why? sdl, malware and reverse engineering are topics that interest me, i did a quick search and people recommend these 3 books: modern C, a modern approach and the C programming language.
 I obviously picked modern C cuz its the most recent book out of the bunch and free, i read a couple of pages, all seems good, then bang | static double const eps1m01 = 1.0 - 0x1P- 01; | double const eps = 1E- 9;
 the hell is 1.0 - 0x1P-01- 01, what am i looking at, from what i understood P is for precision? is 0x1 hex?, double A [5] = { 9.0 , 2.9 , 3.E+25 , 11 .00007}; "3.E+25"?? should i be taking math classes first?
 and then the 1st challenge:
 (1) A merge sort (with recursion) 
 (2) A quick sort (with recursion)
 Is this really for beginners? 
 yeah sure i can google and read or watch a couple of videos about recursion and what merge sorting is, but isnt the point of a book to explain these things in detail and build fundamentals? how is it a fair challenge if you are a total newb starting from 0 am i missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In printf(), all float variables are promoted to double. Therefore, we can use %f to print out double variables. However, the real syntax for double is %lf, not %f.
 Why don't C/C++ developers adopt the guideline of using %lf for double for all functions, including printf()? That would make the whole syntax much more consistent.

I'm quite and don't contribute to the team discussions because most of the time I don't know much enough to contribute to the discussions. Also, I'm not as vocal as I should of for my needs. I keep having this high ego of mine of trying to appear smart and knowledagble around my team members and I get stressed out whenever I do or say something that seems dumb that makes me lose that image. I hate being seen as dumb by my peers growing up and this mindset really hinders my growth since I'm trying to act smarter and knowledgeable than I really am. Has anyone experienced this problem and how do you deal with this? I've made mistakes at my current org where I worked on a feature that's buggy( got tested in lower env) and made it out to prod that affected consumers. I believe my reputations has been tainted by my coworkers and managers in terms of performance wise. Honestly, I haven't gotten any bad feedback from manager. When I do 1 on 1 with tech lead, they say to keep improving and work on smaller tickets. I feel like I may be laid off anytime and I'm surprised to have made it to this far as a dev

 How do computers work? What happens when you tap on a link redirecting you to another website? How does my computer know which button I press on my keyboard, and how does it map to an actual key? What actually happens when I move a file to a different location on my computer?
 We interact with computers and servers all the time. Since the inception of computing, we have abstracted and built upon many iterations of software and hardware to get us where we are now. Even ‘coding’ is an abstraction. When you write a hello-world app in Rust, Java, or whatever, how does that even work? It seems like magic at first.

Now it's at least 1 status meeting a day (sometimes two), and weekly meetings with my manager. Some of us keep getting harassed for status updates and details about the work. It's as if managers have little to do but to keep an eye on us now, and there's fewer of us so more load and more work. Company is on a downward trend overall in revenue. Is it time to leave? Or is that just the reality of things across the industry now?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm learning cpp and as an exercise I'm adapting a 'custom' template Vector class to STL vector instead of dynamically allocating arrays.
 Here's my Vector.hpp:
 #ifndef VECTORHEADERDEF
 #define VECTORHEADERDEF
 #include<vector>
 template <class T> class Vector{
 private:
 `std::vector<T> mData; // mData stored in vector` `int mSize; // size of vector` 
 public:
 .
 . Constructors, getter, setter and overloaded operators (these work)
 .
 Now want to define a function std::vector<T> const& getStorage() const, that returns a const reference to mData, I can't see why my (likely naive) function doesn't work:
 T const& getStorage() const{
 return this -> mData;
 }
 It won't compile when I try to call the function (in my main.cpp). I get the error:
 ./Vector.hpp:165:16: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'const std::vector<double>' to function return type 'const double'
 I initially understood it as std::vector<T> and T being of the same type?
 If I instead write the function as:
 std::vector<T> const& getStorage() const{
 return this -> mData;
 }
 It does compile and run, but when I try to print the result (either in form my main, or directly from within getStorage() ) I get the error:
 invalid operands to binary expression ('basic_ostream<char, char_traits<char> >' and 'const std::vector<double>')
 So,
 What exactly is the difference between my first- and second approach?
 And why can't I do:
 std::cout << "getStorage test: " << vect.getStorage() << std::endl;
 (I would expect to get a print of the address of the first element of the vect. Now I'm questioning if that is even reasonable to expect)
 (Also, I've tried without progress using: const_refrence and data() (from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/vector-class?view=msvc-170#data ) But I'm not sure how to actually use them in my class)
 Any advice is much appreciated.
 Thanks!

I was not allowed to go past the memory reference operator in class however I still went ahead up until pointers. I am aware that I sorta have to go into data structures and binary trees next, however, I believe that is what we're going to cover next semester.
 Now I'm aware that I'm still very much a beginner, however, I'm able to code 99% of beginner coding projects and I'm struggling to make that jump from "beginner" to "intermediate".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So ya I am trying to write a parser for a very very simple toy langue. 
 After 2.5 days of hacking at it I decided to see if I can write it in python. 15 minutes or so and bam I have a parser... 
 Is there a fundemental error in how I tried to represent the string data? Like should i have went with mutble lines instead of references with lengths? 
 Or is it just to be expected?
 Idk could really use some advice The code is here look for src/parser.c

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Start with one question for yourself:
 Do you want a job that involves a lot of coding or not?
 Answer: A lot of coding Possible paths: 
  
Software-focused - Front-end development, back-end development (Java, GO, PHP), mobile app development, desktop app development, big data development 
 Hardware-focused - Embedded software development, hardware architect, IoT development 
 Other - Data mining, algorithms, AI development
  
Answer: Some coding, but not too much Possible paths: 
  
Cybersecurity - Includes network security engineer, penetration tester, security operations, etc. 
 Software testing - Software testing, test development, automated testing, etc. 
 Cloud computing - Cloud operations, cloud engineer, cloud architect, etc
  
Answer: No coding 
  
Operations - Data operations, product operations, etc. 
 Product - Product manager, project assistant, game planner, etc. 
 Design/Interaction - UI design, UX design, game art designer, etc. 
 IT Technical Support - Technical support engineer, network operations engineer, backend support in banks/brokerages, tech company pre-sales, implementation engineer/consultant, pre-sales technical support, etc.
  
In short: If you like coding, go into development. If you don't, go into product, operations, or design. If you can tolerate some coding and want a less competitive field, consider IoT, cybersecurity, or cloud computing.

My goal would be to understand what’s going on behind the scenes of those engines. I tried to understand the source code of a couple of github projects but gave up. Does anyone here know of any good resources where I can get more familiar with these kinds of engines and maybe also resources that have some examples written in c++?

 And honestly after going through odin project and really studying hard. I realized im getting better at coding i understand most of the fundamentals i didnt back then, and im gradually making my way through odin project (javascript path).
 It made me realize i much prefer front end over back end and helped me understand my place and footing in the dev field now. I feel like im actually getting better instead of being at a stand still watching random coding vids online i now jave completed legit projects from odin! I know this is random and its still basic stuff but i feel like i was able to sharpen my skills alot since that incident in the link above and i feel so happy that im getting better!

Call an endpoint to download zip file.
 Extract contents of zip file; it contained a .csv file.
 
Perform a dataload and insert this data into a SQL table.
 
Create a stored procedure and return the results.
 
 I was able to complete the process but I wanted to get a little insight into any performance operations. 
 I used StreamReaders / FileStreams wherever possible.
 I didn’t use EntityFramework but I also didnt use the in memory DataTable. 
 I utilized the SqlBulkCopy as I wanted to perform a batch insert. 
 SQL provides a 2,100 parameter limit to Insert statements.
 I was wondering if anyone had / could provide some insight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I'm new to C and would like to understand the differences between pointers and arrays. Everyone keeps telling me arrays are pointers but the following situation confuses me :
 When i declare an array : 
 int myArray[] = {1,2,3,4};
 I can get a pointer on the first element of this array:
 int* myPointer = myArray;
 When iterating in a for loop, i can use the following :
 *(myPointer+i) = ... or
 *(myArray+i) = ...
 When iterating in a while loop, i can use my pointer : 
 *myPointer++ = ... but can't use 
 *myArray++ = ...
 Is it because arrays are not pointers and increment operator is not defined for arrays ? 
 Thanks for your help 🙂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to use a custom type handler which will convert a string into an enum, however dapper does not seem to recognise the handler I've registered.
 Instead of hitting MyEnumTypeHandler<MyEnum>, Dapper seems to fall back on it's default struct deserializer, and rightfully falls over because it tries to convert the string from the DB to an enum using Enum.ToObject.
 public enum MyEnum {
 Value1 = 0,
 Value2 = 1,
 Value3 = 2
 }
 public class EnumTypeHandler<T> : SqlMapper.TypeHandler<T> where T : struct
 {
 public override void SetValue(IDbDataParameter parameter, T value){ // not important, only reading}
 public override T Parse(object value)
 {
 if (Enum.TryParse(value.ToString(), out T result))
 return result;
 // throw if can't convert
 }
 }
 I've registered the TypeHandler in Startup like so:
 SqlMapper.AddTypeHandler(new EnumTypeHandler<MyEnum>());
 but when I call the connection.QueryFirstAsync<MyEnum> method, it doesn't use the custom type handler.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today at work we had a discussion about the styling of a one statement if. We have clearly different ways of doing it and it is okay in my opinion. Or at least it was until my superior (senior developer) told us that it is a bad practice to not use curly braces in this situations.
 Now what I am asking you is: is it really a bad practice? 
 In my eyes looking at:
 if (condition) { return true; } 
 or
 if (condition) return true; 
 It definitly looks more readable and clean the second approach which is the one I use and feel more pleased with. I am rising concern about creating problems in the future tho.

We could use a dis assembler and mod the assembly serial check to not jump out of the code when a bad serial was entered. We could reassemble and enter anything into the serial and had a full working software. Oh, them days was fun. Then the software programmers became smarter and they started checking for the disassembler. A ugly prompt would open up saying the disassembler software being used could not be used. I was sad. It was fun for a while just to see how things worked. Then it became hard. Doh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am fairly new to the language but given that Go is raved about for concurrency, performance and ease to write it, how come it isn’t used for game development? 
 Languages like Python obviously have the extreme limitations of performance prohibiting them from being used to create triple A games however, it is (typically) fairly easy to write in. Languages like C#/C++ are inherently fast but have a steep learning curve and can be quite technical to write in. 
 Go could be seen as a very good middle ground, so what has stopped games being made in Go?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've used the search engine quite a bit and "TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 1)" seems to be an indispensable tome in the world of networking books, as is "UNIX Network Programming." But opinions seem to be split on "TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 2)." Here's a few excerpts from three different threads:
  
TCP/IP vol 1 is excellent for understanding how networking works and should really be read before learning about sockets. The vol 2 you don't normally read, but rather just skim it if you have time.
 
I’ve only read Unix Network Programming Volume 1. But Unix Network Programming pairs very well with Volume 2 of the illustrated series.
 
Volumes 2 and 3 are more about the actual code used to implement the protocols, so unless you're going to be writing such code (or are just curious), you can probably safely skip those.
 
 The preface to UNIX Network Programming itself claims that TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 2) is a good complimentary read:
  
TCPv2 contains a high level of detail very closely related to the material in this book, as it describes and presents the actual 4.4BSD implementation of the network programming functions for the sockets API (socket, bind, connect, and so on). If one understands the implementation of a feature, the use of that feature in an application makes more sense.
  
So is it fair to assume that I should read TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 1), then TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 2), and finally UNIX Network Programming, or is that overkill? From what I could glean, the general opinion is that TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 1) and UNIX Network Programming seem to be enough. Any help is greatly appreciated, please keep in mind that I'm going for the most comprehensive understanding of this stuff possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven't seen much discussion when it comes to Steam Playtesting, Valve doesn't seem to promote it much and most of the people talking about indie marketing seem to ignore it. I'd like to give the experience I had with the system after approximately two weeks of running my own playtest through steam.
 To Start
 On around May 22nd, I put up my game on Steam Playtest. The build I wanted to test wasn't finished and approved by Valve then, so I just had it open for signups. It took around 5 days to get the build up, and after those 5 days, I had around 41 people signed up to play.
 The day after I put the signup live, my page visits went from 65 to 132, and it went from 2 daily wishlists up to 8. Most of the page views were from direct navigation, with a small subset through steamdb.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a WPF project, and my solution contains 2 projects: (1) WorkerBee, my startup WPF project, and (2) WorkerBeeTests, my MSTest project for unit testing. I am receiving the following error when building my solution:
 CS0006 Metadata file 'C:\Users\astrononymity\repos\C#\Active\WorkerBee\WorkerBee\obj\Debug\net8.0-windows8.0\ref\WorkerBee.dll' could not be found 
 from my WorkerBeeTests project.
 When I open the WorkerBeeTests.csproj file, it contains the following:
 <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"> <PropertyGroup> <TargetFramework>net8.0-windows8.0</TargetFramework> <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> <Nullable>enable</Nullable> <IsPackable>false</IsPackable> <IsTestProject>true</IsTestProject> <OutputType>WinExe</OutputType> </PropertyGroup> <ItemGroup> <PackageReference Include="coverlet.collector" Version="6.0.0" /> <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk" Version="17.8.0" /> <PackageReference Include="MSTest.TestAdapter" Version="3.1.1" /> <PackageReference Include="MSTest.TestFramework" Version="3.1.1" /> </ItemGroup> <ItemGroup> <ProjectReference Include="..\WorkerBee\WorkerBee.csproj" /> </ItemGroup> <ItemGroup> <Using Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting" /> </ItemGroup> </Project> 
 So, I don't see any reference to the .dll file that it's trying to find in this mysterious "CSC" file. As a matter of fact, my main project folder only goes as far as
 WorkerBee\WorkerBee\obj\Debug\net8.0-windows8.0\ 
 I can't figure out why my test project is throwing an error saying that it's looking for a .dll file that I don't think ever existed, especially when there's no reference to that in it's .csproj file.
 Can anyone shed some light as to what's going on here? TIA!

 I have a very strange bug. What I try to do is the huffman algorithm (basically replace bytes with shorter bit sequences for data compression). I created a lookup table (array with 256 elements, for each byte one) which gives me the code and length of the code for a given byte.
 The values of the code length is correct when I initialize another variable with malloc. If I initialize this variable with calloc instead of malloc every code length (for each byte) is set to zero. My dictionary and the other variable aren't related at all. Why could this happen?
 When running the source code the correct length of the codes are outputted. When commenting out line 129 in huffman.c and uncommenting line 130 the outputted length is 0.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am creating a windows MSI installer using Wix (via HeatWave in visual studio). Currently I am using the WixUI_FeatureTree, to allow different components to be selected. This all works fine, however the browse button on the feature selection page is greyed out, and there is no dialog to select install location.
 <UI Id="UI"> <ui:WixUI Id="WixUI_FeatureTree" /> <UIRef Id="WixUI_ErrorProgressText" /> </UI> 
 I can use the WixUI_InstallDir, but then I have no option to choose features.
 <UI Id="UI"> <ui:WixUI Id="WixUI_InstallDir" /> <UIRef Id="WixUI_ErrorProgressText" /> </UI> 
 I have found documentation on Wix very limited, and most of it still refers to v3. What I have found mentions creating a custom UI Dialog, which seems excessive to me. Is there no way to combine Feature Tree and Install Directory to get both sets of features (I don't even need the option to set feature install location separately, everything in the same directory is fine)?

 Book wise, the Phoenix Project started me on this, but honestly The Goal was much more useful, while the Phoenix Project was compelling and entertaining enough to point me in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I recently discovered https://dagger.io/ and I love the concept and after playing around with some scripts and examples, I have a semi working pipeline im starting to get happy with.
 I am interested in looking into using this production (or at least some staging environments for now) but I have concerns, mostly a) the documentation is terrible, its constantly out of date and suggesting different approaches b) the API is constantly changing and there is no clear approach to solve problems. The best source of documentation has been the github issues list, which worries me.
 That being said it seems like a fantastic tool to prevent our current YML soup and promote code reuse. Once I made some initial headway it has been refreshing.
 Is anybody using it and having the same difficulties? Anybody know of similar tooling for producing build images? Interested to hear peoples thoughts.

All this service will do is generate receipts via PDFs. We already have a similar service that does this and a lot more, so we are taking this time to extract out the receipt functionality and make it it's own service for just the receipt portion to improve performance. We made a prototype with Aspose (because we had a license and we used it in the previous app), and just moving it out of this behemoth app into this new service improved performance by a factor of 10. If you don't know, Aspose is a NuGet package in .NET for converting XML style markup into a PDF with data insertion via keywords. This app is purely backend and just produces the PDF.…]]></summary>

Years ago I cobbled together a DIY computer lab in my classroom comprised of throw away, donated PCs. The 21 PCs happily ran Debian 4.0, a few Windows 2000 and were networked into a B/W laser printer. We used the lab for writing projects, e-mail, and research.
 Have any of you used Debian in an educational setting?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I applied to this game company looking for a level designer and they reached out with a test to do with a 15-day time limit to design a level
 doesn't sound too complicated till I saw their brief on the document 
 Here are the red flags
 Create a triple-A quality racing game level (Typical hiring manager wanting everything AAA quality)
 Files to submit: Complete Unity Project (Asking for source files)
 A playable build with a Unity first-person camera (they want a level designer to be a dev)
 they can judge a level design with a presentation or a Document where I can show my methodology and how I planned things in a design that's what a level design document is for
 when a company usually asks for source files they usually mean that they intend to get work done for free and ghost candidates 
 what makes it obvious is that they only made one game on their website which is a kinda janky looking asphalt clone with assets mostly from the Unity store it
 any they don't have much of a presence other than their website that's like those influencer academy pyramid schemes
 Has anyone been in a similar situation how do you circumvent it
 P, S where I'm from it's pretty common to expect to do every role under the sun and especially pull this kind of stunt and this is not the first time in my 4 years in the industry that they have asked you to do their project as a test file for the job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been teaching myself c for a while now and I've been hearing increasing pronouncements claiming production code needs to use Rust and C left to students learning programming.
 I start with the proposition that safe c code can be written and that all unsafe c code can be corrected to accomplish its task in c without being unsafe.
 I don't know c well enough to know if the above assertion is a correct statement of fact. But assuming it is, my next assertion is then: "the world's foremost expert in c could look at my code; detect unsafe practices; and render it safe.
 And if that is all true, then I am puzzled why a machine can't do that for me (us). Isn't that something the compiler should be doing? And if that's too difficult, surely AI can be trained to know the patterns of unsafe code and require the programmer to explicitly reject the proferred 'corrections' and insist upon compiling the code as is. Isn't that what Rust basically does (e.g. permit the programmer to write in 'unsafe mode'?)
 I assume what I propose cannot be done or it already would be done. But for the life of me, I cannot figure out where my logic breaks down. Can someone help educate me why unsafe c code can't be identified by a machine (compiler or other AI code)?
 edit: 10:38: To clarify, I guess I am asking: aren't most 'unsafe practices' something that follow certain patterns that someone who has coded in c for a living for a sufficient number of years would be able to detect right away? And if there are patterns, can't those patterns be put into code for a machine to detect instead of a human? Is 'problem code' so obtuse in its potential variations that it isn't possible to articulate the patterns?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working in the observability and monitoring space for the last few years, we have had multiple folks complain about the lack of detailed monitoring for messaging queues and Kafka in particular. Especially with the coming of instrumentation standards like OpenTelemetry, we thought there must a better way to solve this.
 We dived deeper into the problem and were trying to understand what better can be done here to make understanding and remediating issues in messaging systems much easier.
 We would love to understand if these problem statements resonate with the community here and would love any feedback on how this can be more useful to you. We also have shared some wireframes on proposed solutions, but those are just to put our current thought process more concretely. We would love any feedback on what flows, starting points would be most useful to you.
 One of the key things we want to leverage is distributed tracing. Most current monitoring solutions for Kafka show metrics about Kafka, but metrics are often aggregated and often don’t give much details on where exactly things are going wrong. Traces on the other hand shows you the exact path which a message has taken and provides lot more details. One of our focus is how we can leverage information from traces to help solving issues much faster.
 Please have a look on a detailed blog we have written on the some problems and proposed solutions. https://signoz.io/blog/kafka-monitoring-opentelemetry/
 Would love any feedback on the same -
  
which of these problems resonate with you?
 Do proposed solutions/wireframes make sense? What can be done better?
 Anything we missed which might be important to consider

I'm using the design used in the textbook and most places I checked online, I want to use locks for this and for try out semaphores for a different project. Can someone help me? I haven't been able to solve it for the last couple of days. Sorry this might be long.
 NB// The problem is in the consumer it has a deadlock. I first spawn consumer threads which are waiting for data to enter the buffer. Then I start a handler thread to handle each socket connection, this stores data into the buffer. There's a deadlock when attempting to take the lock with client handler. Even some of the print statements that should print for which ever thread acquired the lock first isn't printing.
 All consumer threads and the client handler share 1 lock.
 The Handler Follows the format: lock -> Wait(until buffer is full)-> deque -> signal empty -> unlock
 The consumer follows the format: lock -> Wait(until buffer is empty)-> enqueue -> broadcast full -> unlock

 Because of that, I have created a new twitch channel where I'm going to be doing live programming sessions and also answer any questions somebody might have.
 I'm also going to have other experienced developers from different fields share their knowledge.
 For anyone interested the link is down below.
 Currently there are no streams available, but the first stream date is set for 3pm Friday Central European Summer.
 Feel free to follow (it's free) so we can become official twitch partners !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working as a junior dev for about 9 months now and something that I've noticed is that I am tired all the time now. I'm a little older than the average junior so I've had a few other full time jobs in the past, both physical and office jobs, and I have never been so tired in my life.
 For reference, I workout 3-4 times a week and get 7-8 hours sleep every night. So, any advice from some of the people that have been doing this job for a while? How do you guys have any energy in the weekday evenings and the weekends to do anything? Do you just get used to feeling like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry I hope I do not annoye anyone by my frequent questioning, but I experiment with pointers and arrays at the moment to learn and fully understand them some day. 
 So on my way to master my favorite programming language, I discovered something strange. How is it, that if I declare a variable and a pointer, and I point to the variable with the pointer p = &i, obviuosly &p != p, but at the same time, if I declare an array, &a == a?
 I fear to answer my own question, but is it because the array by it selve is not a pointer but often is treatet as such? ( There is an approach to explain this technically: since &a == &a[0], because the array points to the first element, and &a[0] is the same as &a, so &a == &a, and since the & operator and the * operator cancel &a == a) 
 Sorry, english is not my native language, I hope my question is still clear. 
 Also I kind of think it is funny that &a, a, &a[0], *a, a[0] and &a[0][0] all point to the same address but all have different types.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a simple problem which drives me crazy. 
 I have two projects, same code, console app, one in .NET framework 4.7.1 the other dotnet6. Both attempts to receive UDP packets from an external device.
 Here's code (cannot be simpler)
 ``` using System; using System.Net; using System.Net.Sockets; using System.Text;
 class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { int listenPort = 4005; string broadcaster = "192.168.0.88";
  using (UdpClient listener = new UdpClient(listenPort)) { IPEndPoint groupEP = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(broadcaster), listenPort); try { Console.WriteLine($"Listening for UDP broadcasts from {broadcaster} on port {listenPort}"); while (true) { byte[] bytes = listener.Receive(ref groupEP); string receivedData = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytes, 0, bytes.Length); Console.WriteLine($"Received broadcast from {groupEP} : {receivedData}"); } } catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine(e.ToString()); } } } 
 } ```
 When I debug in dotnet6 it all works as intended. In .NET framework it simply waits for messages and nothing happens. It's the same if I run it in 'release', even from executable. I was running the code on Windows 10 x64 machine.
 But actually the code is intended to run on Windows7 Embedded (x86) device. What's irritating, any of the codes (not dotnet6 nor .net framework) works on that...
 Do you happen to have any ideas what may be the reason of such weird behavior? Where should I search for problems?
 Thanks in advance. yngwie

 class SomeClass{ ... SomeClass(option1, option2); void ConditionalFunction1();//5 different variants depending on option1 void ConditionalFunction2();//5 different variants depending on option2 void Function(){ConditionalFunction1(), ConditionalFunction2()}; } 
 whats the best way to implement such a class when it gets called a lot with different options?
 I thought about inheriting with something like SomeClass->Conditional1Class->Conditional2Class , making the ConditionalFunctions classes by itself or creating the functions in the constructor and make them function pointers.
 I already read something about strategy pattern but does anyone have any ideas or tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently started as a Principal at a large (3000+ headcount) SaaS company. I've been in software for just over 13 years, and I've noticed a dramatic change in how much I code. Here’s how much time I spent coding throughout my career and the general timeline of my software engineer life:
  
 Time Frame in Career Title Time Coding 
  
 0 to 1 year Graduate Soft Eng 75% 
  1 to 3 years Junior Soft Eng 75% 
  3 to 5 years Soft Eng 60% 
  5 to 8 years Senior Soft Eng 50% 
  8 to 13 years Lead Soft Eng 40% 
  13 to present Principal Soft Eng <5% 
 
 For the most part I've been doing a lot of backend Python/AWS blah blah stuff. But with my new job I'm running several teams for 3 product lines that include front and back end. However the main issue is, as above, I do less than 5% coding per day. The rest is just solid meetings, fleshing out Jira tickets or architecture design stuff.
 I know it's a pointless metric to worry about but I can't help but get a slight bit of anxiety that I'm deskilling and losing the tricks of my trade that got me to where I am. Is this common for a jump like this? My initial Googling all points to wildly different answers, which I suspect will be voiced the same here. But some people, as Principal, say they code for upwards of 50% of the time per day.
 Am I paranoid about getting worried or is this the point of my career that I become Bill Lumbergh from Office Space and actually I'm now a "manager"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have the following code, which gives me a warning, which I do not understand. I am assigning string literals to a std::string in a switch statement:
  std::string languageStr; switch (GetLanguage()) { using enum LanguageType; default: case IN_LANG_GERMAN: languageStr = "D"; <-- warning here break; case IN_LANG_ENGLISH: languageStr = "E"; <-- warning here break; } 
 Changing "D" and "E" into std::string("D") and std::string("E") gets rid of the warnings.
 The warnings are like this:
 char_traits.h:431:56: warning: 'void* __builtin_memcpy(void*, const void*, long unsigned int)' accessing 9223372036854775810 or more bytes at offsets -4611686018427387902 and [-4611686018427387903, 4611686018427387904] may overlap up to 9223372036854775813 bytes at offset -3 [-Wrestrict]
 If you want see the complete example:

 Can someone explain to me what's going on in this case? Why does GCC complain?

The data that i check agains is stored in the db. This, of course, can be performed inside each endpoint individually, but if this is the only way i'm honestly not gonna do this.
 Is there a way for me to add a check with a db call to the default authenctication scheme?

If yes, should I select the desired partition, same FS format (ext4), flag it as root but don't flag "erase it'? Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Recently I am kinda forced into become Team Lead and PO for one new and one old project due to experienced person shortage (with better salary/contreact so not for free). They also hired another mediocre developer instead of me.
 Now the problem is since I am not working anymore the velocity of the team dropped so much since on top of I was doing my work I was also handling unforseen/bullshit tasks for everyone so other developers can only focus on their work. But now I don’t have time at all between two projects to babysit all developers, but if I won’t no work is being completed, if I do babysit then I need to overwork. Velocity dropped more than half with same amount of developers and it is going like that for months.
 Scrum master is telling it is not your problem, but if things go like that there is a chance that projects may be cancelled and my career will be ruined. 
 What is your suggestion? Should I just give up and try to get back into development position? Or is there any way to solve this problem?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an app that works on .net4.8, but in the upgrade process to .net core 8.0 there is a small bit of code that fails.
 It fails at the second line of this code, GetObject():
  cHelper myHelper = new Helper(); cOAPI myETABSObject = myHelper.GetObject("CSI.ETABS.API.ETABSObject") as cOAPI; if (myETABSObject != null) { _SapModel = myETABSObject.SapModel; 
 The error message "Method not found: 'System.ObjectSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetActiveObject(System.String)'
 Doing some research on this, I found this github item:
 https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37617
 Could someone provide some additional reading/sample code using the running object table on how to recreate this without encountering the marshal error? 
 The code I am following is boiler plate code from a structural engineering program called ETABs. A few screenshots below:
 https://preview.redd.it/jq8tlqozko4d1.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=802899467102fc79cf4d9c572c41bf90649cb433

 You can see in the cOAPI interface there is some mentions to ROT.
 It seems like the ETABs API is written such that it makes this call the marshal function, maybe I could work around this with a sample running object table type function?

I always thought that Fedora was the best, fast, stable. but imagine my surprise when I started using Arch Linux. Applications launch much faster, the terminal and application installation are instant, animations do not jitter. All the necessary applications are there, except that I replaced vs code with github codespace. But a question. As I understand it, the gnome app store only works with flatpacks, is it possible to use them exclusively, won’t they work worse than aur apps? and why some bloggers advise avoiding aur. it is safe?

As far as modeling the CPU, memory, and other system components, I've had little trouble thanks to to some system programming classes I've taken in the past. However, I'm at a roadblock when it comes to rendering the video output. I've tried a few different approaches, first trying SDL and then moving on to just using OpenGL libraries and I feel a bit lost. Does anyone have any good resources for getting OpenGL or SDL working for someone with no background in graphics programming? I would even be open to other approaches but preferably staying in C++ and something that could also be used in later projects.
 PS: I am currently just developing in a Windows 10 environment

 Should I be worried about it? If yes, should I use Ubuntu or some other distro instead?

 EDIT* Thank you so much for the help on objects and classes. From what the answers are saying a class is like properties every object has but an object is like the representation of a class.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RSGL is a versatile cross-platform graphics library designed for simplicity and convenience. It offers features like shape drawing, text rendering, and customizable widgets. With no external dependencies and a modular structure, it provides flexibility for various projects. 
 Although RSGL is a graphics library, it only handles graphics data. rendering must be done externally of RSGL.h. By default, RSGL includes RSGL_gl.h which is a opengl backend for RSGL. 
 RSGL also includes a small window abstraction over RGFW but you can use any windowing library with RSGL. RSGL includes an example for using RSGL with GLFW.
 Other than being very dynamic and modular in use, RSGL is also designed to be very lightweight, the current release, this includes compiled binaries, is only ~500kb and the header itself is only 120kb. 
 Here is a simple example of how to use RSGL
 #define RSGL_IMPLEMENTATION #include "RSGL.h" int main(void) { // create a window at the center of the screen RSGL_window* win = RSGL_createWindow("name", (RSGL_rect){500, 500, 500, 500}, RSGL_CENTER); // create a toggle rounded button in light mode RSGL_button toggle = RSGL_initButton(); RSGL_button_setPolygon(&toggle, RSGL_RECT(50, 125, 100, 50), 36); RSGL_button_setStyle(&toggle, RSGL_STYLE_LIGHT | RSGL_STYLE_TOGGLE | RSGL_STYLE_ROUNDED); // while the should should stay open while (RGFW_window_shouldClose(win) == false) { // loop through each event to avoid lag while (RSGL_window_checkEvent(win)) { // check button info RSGL_button_update(&toggle, win->event); } // draw a rectangle RSGL_drawRect(RSGL_RECT(200, 200, 200, 200), RSGL_RGB(255, 0, 0)); // draw the button RSGL_drawButton(toggle); // clear the screen (and render) RSGL_window_clear(win, RSGL_RGB(100, 100, 100)); } // close the window and free everything RSGL_window_close(win); }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Python is one of the most popular languages, many C++ projects end up using Python bindings of some sort. Pytest and Sphinx are very popular frameworks, so many modules have been written, and most projects end up including a copy of these modules or using some hardcoded paths.
 I wrote two Python packages to manage the installation and update of CMake configs for Pytest and Sphinx.
  
https://github.com/python-cmake/pytest-cmake
 https://github.com/python-cmake/sphinx-cmake
  
It uses the pip package management, providing a module for each package and automatically generating a configuration based on the package version found.
 > pip install pytest-cmake > pip install sphinx-cmake 
 I hope this method can standardize module integration for common Python tools. Let me know what you think!

declarative system management makes it easier to remember what all I added, which I tend to forget

huge availability of packages
 
 However, the documentation isn't that great. And since nixos doesn't use the fhs some normal linux advice just doesn't seem to apply.
 But in looking for solutions I realized with a bit of effort I could MAYBE bring a bit of that functionality back to my old stable home of debian with btrfs snapshots and things like distrobox/the nix package manager.

I learned how to integrate into Steam and build something from start to finish (which is something I REALLY struggled with). 
 I know everyone loves numbers, so I wanted to provide a few for those who find it interesting. To date, I've sold about 4,400 copies of my game, with currently 4K wishlists.

I feel like the game is now a much different product than what it was 3 years ago when it was first released, with a ton more features and contents included in the base game (not counting the contents added in the six DLCs). 
 Also since the game has been out for three years, most of the videos/screenshots people have been sharing are of the "old looks", so I'd love to distinguish from that.
 Now that I feel like I am done updating this game and ready to move on to the sequel, I wonder whether it makes sense to give the game a new "identity" by calling it XXXX: XXXXX Enhanced Edition. Do you think this is a good idea, or has this practice been used too much in the gaming industry? It's like every other 5-year old game out there has an "Enhanced Edition", "Director's Cut" etc. lol

 when I try to just run the file I get "undefined reference to `printHelloWorld()'"
 if I change the main file to
 #include <iostream> #include "test.cpp" int main() { std::cout << "Hello world \n"; printHelloWorld(); return 0; } 
 it works fine, and I don't understand what's wrong since my include path is configured as this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a startup in the Netherlands that's growing quite fast (8 to 50 employees in 1.5 years, almost 5m in funding in that time). I'm the lmost senior developer/engineer currently in the role of Infrastructure Architect (and unofficially, but throughout the company acknowledged, Tech Lead but we don't really use that term, my current title implies it), worked there for almost 3 years with 7 years experience in the field, almost from the start, worked for the founders other company until I made the switch) and put up with a lot of stuff along the way, high pressure, lots of overtime and the usual startop stuff that executives/founders normally Recently we hired a DevOps engineer who I manage, his experience is in junior/medior roles and his career spans about 5 years. Today our HR added proper structure to our HRIS so now we can view salaries of those we manage, so I can now see the salary of my new hire. I found this to be more than 1.5x my salary while he pays only 30% tax under the special Dutch law for highly skilled foreign workers. I do a lot of hiring but im'm not involved in salary negotiations, I know I don't make the most because I work at a startup and know I can easily earn at least double at other (probably corporate) companies, I have won awards and completed in/won numerous competitions with fantastic results.
 I'm not alright with this, it feels like a stab in the back after all my loyalty and the stress and even marriage tension. I'm unsure of how to pick this up with management and what this could mean for my career. I really like the company and the culture but this crosses a line for me.
 I'm clueless on how to handle this, I don't want to cause harm to the company by leaving, because that would cause some major, business continuity disrupting damage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a problem that I don't understand in this section of my code :
  long get_number(void) { long long number = get_long("Number: "); printf("%lld\n", number); return number; } int get_ndigits(long long number) { printf("%lld\n", number); int ndigits; if (number >= 1000000000000 && number < 10000000000000) { ndigits = 13; printf("%lld\n", number); } else if (number >= 100000000000000 && number < 1000000000000000) { ndigits = 15; printf("%lld\n", number); } else if (number >= 1000000000000000 && number < 10000000000000000) { ndigits = 16; printf("%lld\n", number); } else { ndigits = 1; printf("%lld\n", number); } return ndigits; } 
 I added the printfs to see where the variable number changes. on the first printf, the function get_number worked properly and I get the correct number (4111111111111). But on the others, I get 140732585691888. Thanks for helping.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hexagonal architecture, onion architecture, layered architecture - whatever you call it, in my opinion, they're all the same. I'm not here to argue about the differences between them. All of my applications roughly conform to the same idea of "separate your domain layer, have an application layer that coordinates the semantics of domain interactions, and have a layer that deals with interaction with other components (services, databases, message queues, etc).
 While this application serves single logical purpose, it's got multiple "ports" on the incoming side:
  
an HTTP adapter to handle requests from external clients
 a gRPC service to handle requests from internal clients
 a message queue consumer, for which we'll have to run a calculation for every message
  
My initial thoughts were to split the queue consumer out to its own repo, but then I really don't like the idea of exposing an API on the original service for the new consumer to hit and a new API to retrieve the requisite data (...because at that point, why not just have it in the same repo?) The resulting service classes each end up updating the service's data store, so I'm inclined to keep them in this same repo.
 Should I push for there be multiple deployments (one for HTTP, one for gRPC, one for message queue consumption) such that they can scale independently? What gotchas should I watch out for if I keep them together, and if I decide to separate them?

 2 years later, a total of 12 months education. I landed an internship with a pretty amazing company based off of work that I did. 
 I had meltdowns, anxiety attacks, I nearly dropped out more times than I can count. Always feeling like I’m not good enough for this and everyone around me is smarter and better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had always dreamed of using a platform where I could select some settings based on the type of application and then generate all the infra code in Terraform that I would need to achieve that, and probably just manage everything in that platform as well.
 For example, imagine I have a Java dockerized microservice that will use Kubernetes, needs security, and has a Postgres DB.
 Let's assume it will be deployed in a brand-new AWS account.
 What I'm looking is for a platform where I can create everything just as a wizard; that platform has to:
 1) Create code to connect GitHub/GitLab to AWS (build docker container and push it to ECR)
 2) Create a CI/CD pipeline to deploy the dockerized service to EKS (This can be triggered from the platform as well, to hide implementation)
 3) Under the hood, based on previous settings, it knows the service needs an EKS cluster, ECR, Cognito, and Postgres.
 Wondering if you are aware of a platform with those capabilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While writing the code for a robot that will stand upright by performing a PID calculation based on the data read from the sensor, I ended up with such a horrible result:
 SelfBalancingRobot kaanRobot(motor1SpeedPin,motor1DirectionPin1,motor1DirectionPin2,motor2SpeedPin,motor2DirectionPin1,\ motor2DirectionPin2,dtCoefficent,setPoint,kP,kI,kD,lowerLimitForSum,upperLimitForSum); 
 It's even worse in the .cpp file:
 SelfBalancingRobot::SelfBalancingRobot(pin motor1SpeedPin, pin motor1DirectionPin1,\ pin motor1DirectionPin2,pin motor2SpeedPin,pin motor2DirectionPin1,pin motor2DirectionPin2\ ,float dtCoefficent,float setPoint, float kP, float kI, float kD,float lowerLimitForSum, float upperLimitForSum) : motor1(motor1SpeedPin,motor1DirectionPin1,motor1DirectionPin2), motor2(motor2SpeedPin,motor2DirectionPin1,motor2DirectionPin2),\ pidController(dtCoefficent,setPoint,kP,kI,kD,lowerLimitForSum,upperLimitForSum) { } 
 None of the parameters I wrote are unnecessary; in fact, I'll need to add even more parameters for the LED or potentiometer, etc. But it looks very complicated and long. Is this complexity normal? If not, how can I cleanly fix it?
 I have an idea, but it seems like an amateur method:
 Motor motor1(...); Motor motor2(...); MpuSensor mpuSensor(...); PIDController pidController(...); SelfBalancingRobot kaanRobot(motor1,motor2,mpuSensor, pidController);

 (I want to thank the people working on this!)
 These minor releases include 2 security fixes following the security policy:
  
archive/zip: mishandling of corrupt central directory recordThe archive/zip package's handling of certain types of invalid zip files differed from the behavior of most zip implementations. This misalignment could be exploited to create an zip file with contents that vary depending on the implementation reading the file. The archive/zip package now rejects files containing these errors.Thanks to Yufan You (@ouuan) for reporting this issue.This is CVE-2024-24789 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/66869.
 net/netip: unexpected behavior from Is methods for IPv4-mapped IPv6 addressesThe various Is methods (IsPrivate, IsLoopback, etc) did not work as expected for IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses, returning false for addresses which would return true in their traditional IPv4 forms.Thanks to Enze Wang of Alioth (@zer0yu) and Jianjun Chen of Zhongguancun Lab (@chenjj) for reporting this issue.This is CVE-2024-24790 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/67680.

Raylib build from Github release (5.0, raylib-5.0_win64_mingw-w64.zip) 
 Files in include/ and lib/ where moved to /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include/ (or ....../lib/ respectively) and the file permissions where checked to be 644
 
 My C code using raylib 
 My build script, the linker flags used where (mostly):

The bizarre behaviour is: while a different program using this same setup (only my C code changes) builds just fine and I can run it from Windows, when I try my problematic program I get this warning at the last moment.

Without going into too much detail, the frontend team is mainly responsible for:
  
A web app for configuring our product
 A client script for implementing various functions of our product on a website
 A React component library for building a UI that interfaces with some of our services.
  
All three of these are fairly significant in scope/complexity, but I felt like we had good coverage and redundancy of knowledge to maintain them, add features, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not everyone loves what they do for a career and that's OK. There's nothing that says you need to love what you do in order to be a good engineer. Choosing a career because you want to make money is a perfectly fine reason to pursue something.
 Most skilled engineers aren't working personal projects day in and day out because they love coding. Turns out you can make tons of money and be super successful while not caring much for the field in general.
 "The best software engineers are the ones that are passionate". Hard disagree. The best engineers are the ones that invest the most time into improving. Whether or not you 'love coding' is irrelevant. You can invest just as much time into something because you know you will make a lot of money in the end.
 Edit: Some people are misunderstanding what I am saying. Not being passionate does not mean hating what you do. I am talking about people who make CS their identity, and then look down/talk down to anyone who brings up the fact that they are doing it because it is a well paying career. I see this a lot more online and amongst students/young professionals.

I started a small personal project in year 2019 and turned it into a website and two apps with hundreds of thousands daily users over the years in my free time. My users love it and despite the very little monetization, it earns me much more than my day-to-day job.

 I enabled hardware acceleration but no cigar.
 I then decided to remove firefox snap and install the deb package and things became normal again.
 Snaps suck. That is all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm trying to use the Boost executor for async operations. But my program somehow is stuck after calling join member function of basic_thread_pool.
 Here is a simple reproducible code: ```c++
 include <boost/thread/executors/basic_thread_pool.hpp>
 include <boost/thread/future.hpp>
 include <iostream>
 include <mutex>
 class Worker { public: Worker() = default; auto doit() -> int { ++count; auto value = count.load(); return value * value; }
 private: std::atomic<int> count_{ 0 }; };
 class Sinker { public: Sinker() = default; void print(int val) { auto lock = std::scopedlock{ mut }; std::cout << "value is " << val << "\n"; }
 private: mutable std::mutex mut_; };
 auto main() -> int { auto worker = Worker{}; auto sinker = Sinker{}; auto pool = boost::basic_thread_pool{ 4 };
 std::cout << "*******1*********\n"; auto work1 = boost::async(pool, &Worker::do_it, &worker); work1.then([&sinker](auto future_val) { sinker.print(future_val.get()); }); std::cout << "*******2*********\n"; pool.join(); std::cout << "*******3*********\n"; return 0; 
 }
 ``` Sorry that I can't demonstrate it on compiler explorer as I don't know how to link boost_thread library to the script.
 The output is: ```text ****1****** ****2****** value is 1
 ```
 Is there something wrong in the code?
 VERSION info: * Boost: 1.83.0 * C++ standard: 20 * compiler: gcc 13.2.0
 Thanks for your attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I’m just completely lost as a new grad when it comes to looking for jobs. I’m having difficulty finding entry level jobs for software engineering. I graduated from Cornell University with no internship experience. The only notable experiences I have are two game development projects I’ve done at Cornell, each working on a team, and one of which I was project lead.
 All of the entry level jobs I look at ask for qualifications that I don’t have, such as Microsoft SQL, REST API, Angular, etc. 
 I feel scared and anxious managing my job search. 
 My priority is to get entry-level experience, so I don’t really care about the pay or whatnot. Would just like to get a job to jumpstart my career. 
 Any help would be appreciated. I’m not sure what to do, what to work on. It seems super overwhelming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started a new PHP job and got to review a PR with two relatively small issues:
  
Some dead code was kept "in case it was needed later on for debugging", with no comment as to what it actually does and why it might be needed
 A redundant is_array($variable) check was kept even though we're sure that $variable is always going to be an array
  
I told the dev, which seemed reluctant to change both issues because "we're never too careful".
 I asked my team lead what he thought of it and if it was something they usually care about when doing code reviews, to which he replied I was right and that he was going to ask him to change it.
 The issue is that I believe this is how most devs work here and I don't really want to end up as "the guy" that keeps blocking PRs for trivial things.
 So how do you guys usually handle it? Do you actually care about this stuff? Do you just ignore it or do you push for the changes every time?
 EDIT: Damn Reddit won't let me edit the typo in the title

 So i wake up yesterday and decided to login to my debian kde install and it wouldn't login.The login window would just bounce me back to the beginning.Tried a lot of things that i thought would work, then got a install disk ready with enough persistence to rip what i needed from the broken install. I start the long copy, let it rest for a bit and i come back to the image telling me exactly whats wrong and a solution (that may work for others, but didn't work for me in the old install)What worked for me is restarting the window manager using
 systemctl restart sddm.service
 I may need to look into it further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've worked at a couple games companies and one I worked at had some very funny gameplay requsts/ requirments and outright outlandish statements from senior staff. One in perticular that still makes me chuckle is telling us we'd failed as game devs because we insisted we should include a mouse sensitivity slider for our game. We were told that the mouse sensitivity should be perfect! and no one should have any need to adjust their mouse sensitity for the game.
 We had to explain that people prefer different mouse sensitivities and not one setting fits everyone. We had a perfect example among our dev team. Me using a edpi of around 2400 and another developer using a edpi of around 400. Needless to say we were never allowed to add a mouse sensitivity slider because according to that senior staff member we were wrong in thinking we needed one. The company is now closed down.
 In general it was like they hated the idea of giving the player any way of changing anything in options, and this is only one example. I just thought that this was a hilarious one that got brought up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been tasked to find a long term solution for automating and centralising the patching of all of our linux servers across multiple cloud providers. We're currently mostly on AWS-GCP, some Azure exposure and to add to the mess, some old onprem stuff on V-Sphere. 
 So far I've been dealing mostly with AWS myself, successfully automating the patching of EC2 instances using the in-built functionalities like PatchManager and AWS' Automations. 
 As of today for some reason, the bosses don't want to patch our servers from within the cloud provider anymore but they're asking for a solution that can be centralised instead, with the goal of patching all of our servers with one unified procedure, regardless of their cloud location or operating system (We run RedHat, Debian, AmazonLinux etc.).
 I need to come up with a plan. So far I've been thinking maybe I could set up Ansible Playbooks and run them across all the VMs targeting their operating system, that's the first thing that comes to mind. I'm not sure as to how to proceed yet.
 Do you have any suggestions/tips as to how you would tackle this? Also is there a service out there already doing this?
 Any insight is much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blend2D 0.11.1 has been released and regardless of the conservative version number the project is progressing and offering more features & optimizations than before.
 Blend2D started in 2015 as an experiment to use a JIT compiler for generating 2D pipelines. It was written for fun with no intention of releasing it. However, because of the excellent results it was indeed released in 2019 under Zlib license and tagged as Beta. The initial version only targeted X86 hardware in its JIT compiler, which was a serious limitation.
 Blend2D's development never stopped and during the years it got new features such as multi-threaded rendering, AVX2 & AVX-512 optimizations, dithered gradients, and even cherries such as SIMD-optimized TrueType font outlines decoding. However, the most important feature, which is AArch64 support, is now part of 0.11.1 release. It means out of box support for AArch64 based SoCs and Apple Silicon.
 Interestingly, the rendering performance is really great on Apple Silicon and in many cases it's even better against competing libraries than on X86 hardware. Results from running a Blend2D benchmarking tool on Apple M3 Pro hardware are available on the Performance page (https://blend2d.com/performance.html) together with AMD Ryzen 9 7950X dataset for comparison. Users can also run their own tests and visualize their results on the Performance page via a "Custom Dataset" functionality. The benchmarking tool now outputs JSON after all tests finish.

 I'm a 17y/o with a 40hr apprenticeship in an office. I'm utterly beginner when it comes to C# or any language at all.
 I have a lot of downtime at my office-based workplace, and was wondering if there were any tools I could use on my phone/work pc I could make use of in my downtime? I cant really install much onto my work pc like visual studio as it just looks a bit suspicious... but I dont want to have this downtime put to waste (can be like 5 hours out of 8 on a really slow day).
 I know it's an awkward request and I sound lazy but those are just my circumstances to be honest. If anyone can help it is much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm migrating a codebase which frequently uses this pattern:
 godbolt for your viewing pleasure
 ``` struct Foo { /..../ }; struct Bar { /..../ };
 struct AdapterBase { /..../ };
 struct AdapterForFoo : public AdapterBase { AdapterForFoo(Foo &) /* ... */ }
 struct AdapterForBar : public AdapterBase { AdapterForBar(Bar &) /* ... */ }
 void Use(AdapterBase &);
 void Example() { Foo f; Bar b; Use(AdapterForFoo(f)); Use(AdapterForBar(b)); } ```
 i.e., AdapterBase is inherited from to adapt various classes (Foo, Bar) to a shared interface that can be consumed by Use);
 This is - (of course... in hindsight) binding a temporary to the reference argument and thus forbidden.
 (I believe it worked in the original code base because of an older MSVC's /permissive option.)
 This is used quite frequently and I'm wondering if there are any good ways to adapt this pattern with minor, possibly local changes.
  
Introducing a named variable is "simple" but often unwiedly:
 ``` void Example() { Foo f; Bar b;
 AdapterForFoo af(f); Use(AdapterForFoo(af));
 AdapterForBar ab(b); Use(AdapterForBar(ab)); } ```
 e.g., for a context like
  container.process(...., adapt(m_a), ....); container.process(...., adapt(m_b), ....); container.process(...., adapt(m_c), ....); 
  
Another solution I thought of is changing the wrapper to a value type (implicitely containing a reference) - but, as said, this pattern is used frequently, so ist's a pretty major change, too.
 Any ideas or suggestions? (simple, obvious solutions are fine, too! ;))

I'm making an IDE for Fortran as my first big project and I'm using ImGui and SFML. It is written entirely in C++ with a little bit of C and I want to add a search menu for the FPM Registry to someone could install a plugin with a simple click of a button. I know that there is the fpm-search ability and I have general idea of how I could do this. In my head I would just go through the registry so what packages there were and then manually create a "page" for them in the menu but this seems really inefficient. I don't know how else I could go about this so if anybody here could help me, that'd be great.

I am in between jobs for the last few months, I am targeting Director of Engineering roles. I am not really hands on in the last couple years.
 I lost my job in Feb'24 and had just one interview since then which I thought went well but never heard back from them. But just getting one interview in 5 months is really demotivating and I am just contemplating going back to individual contributor roles but I don't want to. I understand I don't have enough experience at senior management but am I shooting too high and wasting time here?
 Could you guys please suggest me what can I do during this time to upskill myself for Director or VP level roles?

 I have recently been running a Minecraft server on Debian 12 and with the new Minecraft update coming out next week I've started to prepare for the upgrade however Minecraft versions after 1.20.4 require Java 21 to run and as far as I'm aware Debian 12 supports java 17 is there an easy way to update the java version as everywhere I look online only shows how to update the JRE and not the JDK (which is what I think I need) either way when attempting to launch the server on versions after 1.20.4 it says: 
 "java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: net/minecraft/bundler/Main has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 65.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 61.0"
 Which to my knowledge means the server is still running on Java 17 even though I updated to Java 21 is there an easy way to update or will I have to change OS to get Java 21 running?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm seeking for a good stack for my new app, and I reached Tauri, but I have a few doubts.
 First of all, let me explain my situation 
 I need to build a desktop app, maybe also for mobile, but this would be later. This app would need some SQL stuff, not too much desktop integration.
 The main reason to no develop a simple web It's avoid using servers.
 Right now I'm good with typescript and react. Also python but I think it won't be useful for that.
 I don't know rust, but I don't mind to learn.
 
 My first thought was about electron, some apps I use are made with electron, it's widely used and fits my language knowledge, but, maybe it's a bit bloat, some of the apps I use are slow even for "simple" purposes. Also bundle size could be close to 200M for a simple text editor. Apps like VSCode are very optimized despite that, but I'm not Microsoft,
 So I saw Tauri, It looks great, even made my first "hello world" app in twenty minutes, but I cannot find serious projects using this technology. Most of the stuff I found are simple hobby projects abandoned a couple of years ago. Even most of the posts on the internet talking about Tauri are from 2022.

 I'm trying to use GNU Autotools to implement a simple project of "unit tests" in C. I intend it to be similar a Leetcode, that is, I'll create the tests of the function I'd like to implement. After that, I'll develop the code and then, use my precreated tests to verify if the code is working properly. 
 I want to use GNU tools to implement that, and my first try wasn't so successful, and it's in my github (yes, the name of project is C-Leetcode). In the project there is the following files: 
  
 File Description 
  
 sum_minus.h Declaration of methods sum and minus 
  sum_minus.c Definition of methods sum and minus 
  sum_minus_test.c Usage of methods sum and minus 
  configure.ac Initial configuration of GNU Autotools 
  Makefile.am Automake configuration 
  test_sum_minus.at "Unit tests" 
 
 However, this code is resulting an error when I perform the following bash instructions:
 autoreconf --install ./configure make make check 
 The error informs that the instruction AT_INIT wasn't found.
 If you could help me, I'd be eternally grateful.
 Best regards!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 Right now I have several different UI apps which are on different domains.
 I want to move them all to a single domain and separate them by an url path, for example:
 www.foo.bar/grafana
 www.foo.bar/rabbitmq 
 The way I've envisioned this is that I'd be using nginx proxy_pass to forward requests to local services with a config like that:
 location /grafana/ { proxy_pass https://grafana.local/; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host; proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding; sub_filter_types *; sub_filter_once off; sub_filter "src=\"" "src=\"grafana/" } 
 , but I've encountered 2 problems: 
  
Html is trying to download resources from base domain, not from domain + path. So for example if there is some element in html having src="path/style.css" browser will try to download from www.foo.bar/path/style.css and not www.foo.bar/grafana/path/style.css. This will obviously fail as nginx won't know what to do with this request.
 This can be dealt with using "sub_filter" directive (with some pain) so it's not that bad. However, the next problem is much worse. 
 
Redirects
 The problem is very similar to the previous one. When I go to the grafana index page it redirects me to /login path. The issue is that it will take me to www.foo.bar/login and not www.foo.bar/grafana/login. I haven't found any way of dealing with this and it's preventing me from proceeding. Grafana is kind enough to give you root_url config which is made for situations like these, but rabbitmq or kafka-ui and other services simply don't. 
 
 Anyone has any experience with stuff like this?

 It's in Vietnamese. He was super enthusiastic about the game and I thought the video was very high quality too (editing etc). I'm so unbelievably confused, because my sales are not changing at all. I can confidently say it had no impact whatsoever. I did get a huge spike in direct navigation, but the sales yesterday were actually at some of the lowest of the week. I saw someone say in the comments "I can't buy it because it costs 100.000". Which translates to $3.7. The normal price of the game is $7 in USA. This is Steam's auto conversion which they recommend. I suppose this is a Vietnamese thing, but still so strange to see literally no one buy it when the youtuber is having a great time.
 Edit: As a commentor said, Steam is currently banned in Vietnam. I'm devastated.
 Edit2: People told me to put the name and link in the post. The game is called RollScape, it's a numbers roguelike inspired by Roll: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2904290/RollScape/

However, it is too slow for some of the hidden test cases and therefore fails as a whole. I'm pretty sure the error is in evauluateAllOrders(...) where I am recursively creating a whole lot of vectors.
 If someone could help me speed up the code, and maybe give a little feedback on if I do something dumb or amateurish, I would really appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[just finished my first year in college and its summer holiday so I decided to finally take programming seriously and learn it this time 
 I did some research and asked a bunch of my friends and most of the answers were either go straight into learning Python or you should take CS50 first 
 so if I want to start at the roots with CS50 which I would assume it's the Harvard CS50x should I go with the long 11-week course or just take the 12hr video on YouTube is there a benefit of taking the longer course (I also found others like CS50p and CS50AI do I take them after CS50x)
 and if I start with Python I was told about a Youtuber called Bro Code I was told that He is one of the best out there or should I go with CS50p 
 there are a lot of routes and choices to make I don't know what to do and I don't even know if learning Python is the best step I'm taking a Control and automation engineering major and some of my seniors told me that MATLAB/Simulink would be better for me is that true or do I even need to learn Matlab it seems a bit old and outdated to me if anyone here has info about this I would love an answer and thanks very much

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have almost no experience other than learning some of the basics of Java after taking computer science classes in highschool for a year. Don't remember much of anything though.
 I browsed this sub a bit and saw most people recommend Whitaker's book and Tim Corey's courses. I'm not a very smart person at all so I feel like I'd struggle following directions in a book and Corey's courses are way too expensive for me. I'm sure they're worth the money but I can't spare that much, unfortunately.
 I found a bunch of tutorials online but I'm not sure which one to follow, they all seem decent enough.
 I found two videos on freeCodeCamp.org's channel, one being a 4 hour course for beginners and the other being an 8 hour long full course with mini projects and an identically titled video by CoffeNCode, but they seem to be two separate videos. Lastly there's also C++ full course for free by Bro Code.
 Any tips? Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Honestly posting this to blow off steam, but would appreciate any advice.
 I’ve maintained a 4.0 GPA throughout college and will be graduating next year (at which point I’ll likely apply for grad school), but I’m struggling to land big internships. I have around 3 big projects in C++ and Python which I’m fairly proud of. I also have a few internship at my uni and at startups. Not a lot in terms of the number of places I’ve worked in, but a lot of them I’ve continued for over a year. However, I’ve yet to land an internship outside of startups and at my uni, with most applications not even getting an interview. I’ve had a few people look at my resume and I’ve incorporated their advice, but it hasn’t helped much. 
 Tbh, I don’t know why I even try if recruiters don’t care about my GPA and experiences. I know my experiences can probably be a lot better, but i don’t know how to get a worthwhile experience if all my resume gets rejected. The only other reason i can think of is probably the fact that I’m on an F1 visa, and that I’m not very good at networking.
 I’m working to fix the latter over this summer but I wish that recruiters could put more weight on my existing experience and GPA, since right now it just feels like I’m trying extra for something pointless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://crates.io/crates/undname
 What is this?
 undname is new library written entirely in Rust, whose purpose is to turn symbols mangled by the MSVC compiler (e.g. ?world@@YA?AUhello@@XZ) into their demangled/human readable form (e.g. struct hello __cdecl world(void)).
 Why did you write this?
 I work a lot with mangled symbols, and I am unsatisfied with existing solutions available to Rust users:
  
The first option is to use the classic UnDecorateSymbolName from Win32's Dbghelp api. The issue with this avenue is as follows:
  
Passing mangled strings to UnDecorateSymbolName requires you to convert their encoding to utf-16. Mangled strings can come from a wide variety of sources, and while it is common in the modern era for these strings to be utf-8 encoded, that is not always the case.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been a software developer for the past 10 years, focusing primarily on backend development. Recently, I've been thinking about switching gears and moving into the DevOps domain.
 I’m planning to kick things off with a DevOps course from KodeKloud and aim to complete the CKAD certification afterward.
 For those who have made a similar transition or are already in the DevOps field, I have a few questions:
  
Will completing this course and certification be enough to land senior roles in DevOps?
 What additional skills or experiences should I focus on to make myself a strong candidate for these roles?
 Any tips or resources that you found particularly helpful during your own transition?
  
Also, given my 10 years of experience, I’m not looking to start in a junior role. Any advice on making this transition without having to start over at a junior level would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance for any advice or insights! :)

 Recently, I converted method some methods from using an IList<int> to using IList<T>, so as to various project-specific objects, example:
 public void Shuffle<T>(IList<T> deck) {...} 
 Some more specific methods in this file pertain to a specific class declared within, intended to be used as a "skeleton" to build off of in projects. I'm trying to convert those methods by updating the class to generic-type lists, so that classes based on it can declare a list of whatever object type I need for that project. Something to the effect of:
 public abstract class MyClass { public abstract List<T> Objects { get; } } public class ChildClass1 : MyClass { public override List<int> Objects = new List<int>(); } public class ChildClass2 : MyClass { public override List<bool> Objects = new List<bool>(); } 
 Is there a way to achieve this or at least something similar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I’m a DevOps engineer with 5 years of experience at a growing company that I enjoy for the most part. I work from home, pay is good (153k salary, NYC), 9-5. My current role exposes me to a wide range of tech (AWS, CI/CD, Terraform, GitHub/GitLab, ECS/Docker, Datadog, scripting, etc.) and even some Python work with Data and Analytics teams. However, the one thing missing is that feels substantial (to me?) is Kubernetes (k8s) experience – at a previous role I used it for just over 1 year. Our tech stack is composed mostly of EC2/ASG (bootstrapped with poorly written chef from a company we bought, bleh), Lambda, CDNs, some ECS and API GW.
 I’m 29, and while my current company offers room for advancement to senior roles and beyond, I’m worried that not having more k8s experience, right now, could impact my career for the worse. There’s a possibility we might use Kubernetes in the future as we are in the early stages of migrating most of our applications to containers and ECS, and if the use case for orchestration arises, but it’s not certain.
 Would you recommend jumping to a new job where k8s exposure is guaranteed, or should I stay put and hope for future opportunities with k8s at my current company?
 Looking forward to your advice!
 TL;DR:
 Enjoy my current DevOps job with good pay and growth potential, but lacking Kubernetes exposure. Should I stay and hope for future k8s opportunities or jump to a new role where it’s guaranteed?

When I read the message character by character I get the expected response however it looks like the program doesn’t know where the message ends. When I extract all the characters and try to extract another it will cause the program to become unresponsive.
 So let’s say my input stream is denoted by is and my expected response is “Hi”. If I do isc;, isc; I will extract both H and I but when I call is>>c; again I get the issue. You might say “you need to check if any flags are raised” but .eof() or any of the other checkers don’t indicate anything.
 I’ve heard that istreams have their end flag raised by a terminating character, usually \n. So is there a way I can just tack this on to the end of the input stream after reading the response from the device? Thanks for any help

I just had a question about my code. Is the way i did the math inside the parentheses of the if statements here bad practice? Should i be creating a different variable beforehand to evaluate the entered integer before the if statements? 
 Could it lead to issues in other contexts, and if so could you give an example possibly? I don't want to ingrain bad habits I guess, but I'm not sure if this is something I should even be worried about at this point.
 int main() { cout << "Please enter an integer value to determine if it is even or odd: "; int val1 = 0; cin >> val1; if (val1 == 0 || val1 % 2 == 0) cout << "The value " << val1 << " is an even number.\n"; if (val1 % 2 == 1) cout << "The value " << val1 << " is an odd number.\n"; }

 I'm trying to come up with a secure and reliable authentication solution for the project I'm working on. 
 I consists of a React Web SPA and a Flutter mobile app, of course using ASP.NET Core as a REST API-only backend. I'm not sure how to tackle the problem of authenticating my users to both clients. A user can login using same account on both apps.
 I have some requirements that have to be met and some problems:
  
I don't to use an external identity provider like Auth0 or Firebase. I want to store user credentials in my own database. I have no problem with writing some password-hashing code myself.
 Native login: I don't want to open a browser window in my mobile app or redirect to another page in SPA, so I don't use OAuth
 Use cookies for the web app and Header-Authorization for the mobile app? It is considered insecure using localStorage for authentication tokens in SPAs
 Session management: I tend to use Server-Side-Sessions that are stored in the database. Users in the mobile app stay logged in infinitely, users in the web app should be logged out after 30 days of inactivity.
 How to pass the session ID to the mobile app if we can't use cookies the same way as in the Web app? Should we transmit it in the body JSON? Should the API check for a authentication token in both locations (Cookie and Header)
 Session rotation: When someone signs in, the server-side session token is generated and stored in the database, until it expires or the user logs out. Do I need some kind of rotation for this token?
  
What would you recommend? Do you have any examples for this use case or any libraries that I might use?
 Thanks a lot!

Beijing is outsourcing cyber operations to private-sector hackers, revealed through a recent restructuring of China's cyberforce and a document leak.
 
Chinese authorities restrict information flow by banning search terms, scanning social media, and blocking access to foreign media.
 
Cyberattacks on dissident groups and Chinese-language media have occurred around the anniversary.
 
China's cyberforces have been restructured, with the Ministry of State Security and the Strategic Support Force playing key roles.
 
Private Chinese cyber contractors have been exposed for hacking for profit, collaborating with the government.
 
Chinese hackers have a history of cyberattacks motivated by ideology and nationalism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sorry but this is a rant. I really can't understand how someone could come up with a software like Gimp which is super counterituive. I can't figure out a single keyboard shortcut. Even zooming out and in is a pain.
 Why did they group all the tools on the left? Looking for a tools is like a hide & seek game.
 I open Gimp once a month, for some simple photo editing and I waste hours for nothing.
 Why can't they just copy the UX from Photoshop?

 Some here have called it "spaghetti code". For a webapp of this size and scope tho, I think it's just Tuesday.
 What do you think is a solid sign of "yep sketti code"?

I know it should be thousands to be even relevant, but for my first game it is such a joy to see that people are interested in my game! I have already received a lot of positive and constructing feedback and it motivates me to improve the game and think of new features and environments!
 The goal was to release a demo in steam by the start of June and get 100 wishlists without any marketing budget at all. I am really learning a lot about marketing my game these days and I must say, I really do have a lot of respect for marketeers. I mean, how do you make people know about your product without being super pushy all the time?? Anyways, I thought it would be fun to share this small achievement :)

Now I've been hired as DevOps at a company and I'm going to have to use Windows on the company PC as my daily operating system. Do any of you know how to make this transition smooth? I mean, I'm used to coding in vim, navigating the file system through the terminal, and so on… is there any software you suggest to give a "unix efficiency" or "unix behavior" to Windows? (No virtual machine)
 PS: I hope this is the right place to post this message. I guess some of you may have the same problem if you work in industry and can give some advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While trying to explore C ergonomic APIs, I realized I could "name" my matrix's dimensions using a union.
 #define SIZE 9 enum { X_AXIS = 0, Y_AXIS = 1, AXIS_COUNT }; typedef union { u16 axes[AXIS_COUNT][SIZE]; struct { u16 x[SIZE]; u16 y[SIZE]; }; } Matrix_t; _Static_assert(sizeof(((Matrix_t){0}).axes) == sizeof(Matrix_t), "[!]"); int main(void) { Matrix_t foo = { .axes[Y_AXIS][5] = 42, }; assert(foo.y[5] == 42); return 0; } 
 Please note that I'm not sure if the static_assert is sufficient for garantying that this code is portable. The problem is that the compiler could decides to pad float x[8] causing the y[0] to not be aligned with axes[Y_AXIS][0] anymore; breaking the code.
 Let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately, I have been thinking and reading a lot about what makes code great and high-quality. 
 There was recently a discussion on Hackernews where surprisingly many developers confessed they even ship code that would hardly pass a normal code review process just to get something done. 
 This is totally understandable since I work at a startup too, but at the same time we often argue about whether we should cut corners in some specific cases. 
 I am personally a huge antifan of premature optimization and unnecessary abstractions (hello Sandy Metz). My personal rule is closer to the rule of 3. 
 That said, I still have trouble understanding how to make this decision. When is it okay to half-ass some code and make management happy? When is it definitely not? 
 What do you think?

 I recently got an e-mail from now.gg that my game is featured on their platform. However, I find the whole business model shady and according to google analytics my game is getting increased traffic from US yet I get no monetization from it. Which probably means that they hide my ads but they display their excessive and low quality ads over my game. I'm really worried that 1 star bombing will starts towards my new game cos of the low quality platform and because they think the excessive ads are coming from my game. They said if I reply with OPT-OUT they will immediately remove the game but I still see it on their platform...
 Have you ever experienced such an issue? What actions did you take?

 This is the case with the Asus X102BA I currently have on hand. This thing is so slow and underpowered, that even basic tasks take basically forever.
 I installed Debian Bookworm onto it as an attempt to keep it alive. The low CPU speed and the low amount of RAM make things very hard, though. I chose the 32-bit x86 build because this thing only has 1.5 GB of usable RAM after the GPU has taken its cut.
 At least the integrated GPU has decent support out of the box, unlike old graphics cards made by a certain manufacturer cough Nvidia cough

There are 4 engineers including myself and we do mob programming on one task with our cameras on for basically 8 hours a day unless there is another meeting we are supposed to attend (rare). This isn't just a temporary thing while we set up a service, this is for every story that we complete in our sprint and they have been doing this for years. As a junior engineer I don't really feel like I'm able to learn as well compared to my old team where I would have independence to tackle work on my own. Is this normal? I'm only supposed to be on this team for 3 months before I rotate to another, but I'm considering asking my manager to let me go back to my old team since I feel like I'm not really able to work well like this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve posted on here before about my current position. I’m an associate DevOps engineer. Have been for a little over a year and a half. I make $61k and everyone says I’m way underpaid. (DC, Maryland, Virginia btw)
 But I only have an associates degree in cybersecurity and a year of digital forensics grunt work before I got into this DevOps role. 
 Everyone tells me on here I’m way underpaid and I’m being taken advantage of and my company is getting cheap labor. 
 But the thing is I’ve applied and applied and have been getting nothing back. 
 I know the job market generally sucks rn. But for DevOps some of these requirements are insane. The active secret clearance is what gets me. How are you supposed to have an active TS clearance if the company won’t sponsor you? Also clearances are EXPENSIVE, if you have one, why would you be jumping ship to another job??
 8+ years of exp required Must have bachelors with 4 years exp.
 I’m only at an associates with a year and a half of DevOps experience.
 My tech stack is Azure, K8s, PostgreSQL DB, Terraform, Azure Bicep, Debian, Ubuntu, Python, Docker, YAML, some node.js.
 Kinda stuck here. What do I do?
 I’ve got an AZ-900, studying up for the AZ-104. But even if I had AZ-104 I don’t think I’d have much better luck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a great resume already, currently principal engineer at a unicorn after leaving a FAANG position. However, during the nights and weekends at my current job, I've been running a side project that has gotten out of hand. I've scaled it to nearly 500k users and will do around $330k gross revenue this year. I haven't paid myself yet though, as I'm pumping everything into ads and contractors. With that being said, I don't want to go full time as I'm just not willing to accept the risk right now (my first kid is arriving in August). 
 I've also been looking to change positions here soon to something a bit lower stress. I'm wondering if you'd include the side gig on your resume / in interviews or just focus on the day job. I'm worried the side gig will make me look less dedicated to my day job or like I'll bail at the first opportunity if it continues to grow...

 It displays CPU and memory usage of NFS processes, count of file-level events, providing insights into file access and modifications.
 I will soon add more features such as: Network statistics, system load,I/O stat of NFS client and server processes, source IP of event, and will enhance the TUl.
 Check it out and share your feedback.

 int main() { int i = 4, k = 1, j = 4 * k; while (i + 1 ? --i : j++) { printf("%d. iteration", k); printf("%d %d ", i, j); } return 0; } 
 Solution is supposed to be, and is by VS written as: 1. iteration3 4 1. iteration2 4 1. iteration1 4
 When I ask GPT and myself however, both unreliable sources, I get that there's an additional 1.iteration0 4, after which it finishes. For a full hour I've been trying to figure out the logic of when and how the while loop breaks, using different values and signs, and tried to find explanations online to no avail.

 So, few days ago I took the decision to stop giving Bill Gates my personal info anymore and this was maybe the best decision I ever took regarding my computer. I finally switched to ARCH LINUX. I can't lie, it was hard in the beginning to adapt to my new OS, but after researching through the wiki I managed to be in a decent level of understanding how to do basic things such as installing packages, updating the system etc. Then, I tried to install my favorite game, World of Tanks. I was scared first, but I managed not only to install properly the game, but I even got better fps and performance than I used to get in Windows 10. It's unbelievable. I'm currently using the same settings and I get more fps. Also, I found that many more games are available with Linux through Wine, Proton etc. I don't understand why people still use Windows!
 What are your experiences about gaming on Linux?

The challenge of the actual code and DSP logic is nothing but fun, but my learning process is rather slowed down because of VS2022 problems...
 Assume I have a class, that is part of a larger project utilizing the framework for GUI and DSP. This project works great, and I have a synthesizer that compiles fine and is fully functional. But Intellisense does not notice 99% of errors, and also doesn't give me correct member suggestions when coding.
 So let's say I have a function void processNextSample() {} that takes care of the audio rendering. If I put some straight nonsense in there, like Oh right, I should have bought> toothpaste()).,;, intellisense does not notice that anything is wrong... It only seems to update when I build? What's going on here?
 It worked yesterday, and I have not changed any settings.
 EDIT: It was a silly templating thing lol

 bool EventQueue::empty() const { return eventqueue.empty(); } ```
 here is what I have for the queue. Why wouldn't this work, and how could I fix this?
 Event is an abstract base class that has children MarketEvent, SignalEvent, and OrderEvent. The comparator compares the timestamps on the events so that the oldest tiemstamp is on top. I need the pop to return the correct event type of the top event (i have a member function of event to return the event type), and for push to accept any event type.
 Edit: Added event_queue.h

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been the tech lead of a team of ~5 for about 18 months. 2x Senior engineers, 1x Senior devops (also supports a sibling team who owns two k8s apps), 1x early mid and 1x junior.
 One of the seniors left by their own volition. A 15YOE replacement was hired and it was immediately obvious they could only deliver at a junior level. I advised the manager to get rid of them before their probation period was up. They wanted to give them a chance to improve, which hasn’t come to fruition. Once they pass probation, you can’t fire people without cause in my country.
 Start of the year, budget cuts happen and the remaining two seniors (who were contractors) have their contract ended. A fresh grad devops engineer is recruited. Team now consists of: myself as lead, mid with ~6YOE, junior with ~3YOE, junior with 15YOE, junior with ~0.5YOE.
 I’m getting smashed from all sides. Interacting with the business, being the sole senior engineer, handling a lot of the devops work since it’s moderately complex and a fresh grad is way over their head here. I’d hoped the mid level would rise up but it’s becoming clear that mid level could potentially be their peak. Struggling to keep the lights on let alone have time to grow the other members. Recent feedback from the engineers is that they need cards to have more detail for implementation (which is part of my role) so I feel like I am struggling to perform my core responsibility.
 Recent restructuring has brought in a new manager who asked if I want to go back to being an IC. Do I throw in the towel and wait for an opportunity with better support to dip my toes into the leadership path again? Or continue; but focussing on my core roles and letting the cracks I’ve been papering over widen?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to install Arch manually on a drive that already has an existing Linux distro, and thus already has an EFI partition with grub installed. I haven't been able to find any good info out there about how to handle this situation; I want to end up being able to boot both, and I'm worried that if I poke around and try things I'll end up able to boot neither.
 Currently I have Arch installed to a partition, and I've got it mounted inside the preexisting distro and can chroot in. If I run update-grub from the preexisting distro, it doesn't seem to find the Arch install despite having os-prober enabled and running. What do I need to do to get both partitions bootable via grub?
 (or, alternatively, safely switching to rEFind; that would be okay too)

 waits for the user to enter a password

And even that it's legitimate, it wasn't being updated for 10 years so anything that was running was already legacy and had some technological debt before it got officially closed. Can't say Xamarin was abondonned, the last version was released in 2023 and they released MAUI before ending support on xamarin, so it's not like they let it rot for 10years without updates before closing. 
 I can't find what else microsoft could have possibly abondonned to get that reputation.

I THINK it was around 2000 because I seem to remember that Potato was stable and Woody was testing at the time. I had been using RPM based distros like Redhat and Mandrake before that point and found myself frequently mired in dependency hell. I was awe-struck by Debian's competently managed packaging system. Everything just worked out of the box. My only complaint was how long it would take for DE releases to trickle into the repositories. I understood that was the price for a stable package system, but I still wanted to play with the latest and greatest UI.
 Some companies and projects came and went that tried to fix this issue. Ximian Desktop came out in 2001 which enabled you to install a desktop release on top of whatever OS you are a…]]></summary>

 I was a happy Windows user all my life, and switched to Linux Mint a few weeks ago. I won't bother you with the reasons since they're irrelevant for this discussion.
 Anyway, I switched to LM precisely because it was touted as a good distro for "beginners". In the time since I switched, I've been educating myself a bit on the whole Linux ecosystem and I can't help but think that the label "for beginners" is actually a mislabel and that it gives off the wrong impression.
 The general advice more or less goes: If you're new to Linux, get a beginner's distro like LM or Zorin or Pop. And then when you 'learn' Linux, you can step up to the 'real' deal (i.e. distro-hop) with the end-destination usually being Arch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm currently playing around with C++20's comparision operators and have found some strange behaviour I could not explain and is consistent across MSVC, clang and gcc.
 I have a wrapper class W that is implicitly convertible from and to the contained type T. Additionally, equality comparisions between the wrapper and the contained class should be supported. If I add the conversion operators and the equals operators (W/W and W/T), the call of operator== with T and W works as expected (performing no conversions and using the definded equals operator with reversed arguments). But as soon as I add an operator!= for W/T, I get a compiler error in all three major compilers.
 The following godbolt link https://godbolt.org/z/7hx45MxfT shows the errors. If the operator!= is removed, all three compilers succeed.
 Could anybody help me to understand why this is the case?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I'm de/serializing the hexadecimal (%a) representation of floats into strings.
 clang's std::from_chars doesn't have a specialization for floats and fast_float doesn't deserialize hexadecimals.
 So I'm using fmt::format() to serialize and std::strtof() to deserialize instead.
 The very first line of my serializing and deserializing functions reads:
 std::setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, "C");
 Am I safe for locale independence or are there more potential pitfalls I should be aware of?
 Thanks!

 And most specifically I want to see if there is a website out there for testing C++ concurrency knowledge - I've just read through "C++ Concurrency in Action" and would love to test some things out.

I downloaded windows again and realized their installation tool didn't have a working built in network driver. At that point panic started to set in. I couldn't update my driver because that meant connecting to the internet which I couldn't do! But apparently a few minutes of searching led me here. It just works! Wow! The Windows installation tool was 7GB and it still didn't have a working driver inside. Thanks debian.

 I thought the goal was to finish early and work on other team projects but I'm scared to come off over qualified.

 I decided to start learning C but unfortunately haven't gotten any headway since. I'm using VS Code and have set up my IDE, installed the C/C++ extensions, downnloaded and installed the C/C++ tools from visual studio build tool, launched VS Code from developer command prompt. Also changed the default project folder via the command prompt. I've checked my Compiler is working using the cl command in the terminal too.
 Thought that'd be all...but I was wrong. I can't even run a simple Hello world program. It keeps telling me kindly specify the correct input path. I've tried lots of solutions, went to their documentation web page, asked Copilot, went through the intellisense configuration but I'm still stuck 😭
 Isn't it the <stdio.h> to be able to call the printf() function? By the way <stdio.h> isn't even appearing in the drop down list of #include functions provided by the "code assistant" (I've forgotten the exact term for it)
 Please can anyone help me?🙏🏼🙏🏼 I really need this for an online course I enrolled in and it's literally the first topic we're dealing with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically a title.
 I am learning about system design and keep wondering should I be able (or is it expected) to implement the system I designed given I know how to design it? 
 Say it's a simple but distributed system, that should be scalable and highly available. So given enough time (say I do it as a pet project or hobby), should I be able to implement it (in a basic form, taking industry standard software like postgres, cassandra, kafka, redis, ngnix, some backend business logic in platform/language/framework I am experienced with, docker, kubernetes etc.) and deploy it (also in a basic form, say to some cloud provider or on cloud provider)? I know it's a lot of work for a single person, but just creating a an hello world example of a distributed system with basic functionality from each component. 
 Or is system design mostly theoretical thing and designer should delegate implementation to other people/teams with their expertise in each part of the system?
 What are your thoughts on this and did you actually try to do it for yourself (ie. learning purposes)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 I've been working on a Gameboy emulator for a few weeks, and I've hit a wall. The following is a description of the events that unfold, together with debug information:
  
The bootrom Nintendo logo is loaded and carried out. Then the game loads as usual. 
 IE: 0b0000'0001 | IF: 0b000'0001
 JOYP [FF00]: 0b1111'1111
 
 I press the mapped "Start" button: 
 IE: 0b0000'0001 | IF: 0b0001'0000
 JOYP [FF00]: 0b1101'0111
 
 I release the mapped "Start" button: 
 IE: 0b0000'0001 | IF: 0b0001'0000
 JOYP [FF00]: 0b1111'1111
 
  
And nothing happens. IE never becomes 0b0001'0001 in order to enable the interrupt. One source I read claims that that most games do not use this interrupt for joypad inputs.
 Interestingly, if I keep pressing "Start", at some point, the game registers that it has been pressed, and the screen advances. I have done the same with the other buttons, where the game loads, and I will, for example, press "Left Arrow" and the character will move, after like 50 button presses.
 Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m looking for a way to draw an image directing on the screen in such a way that it doesn’t get captured by recording software. I’ve noticed certain overlays not showing up in my Nvidia captures, I imagine it’s like a pipeline effect…? Injecting a draw directly at the last step of the screen render pipeline, making the recording softwares miss it completely. I couldn’t find clear information on this, doesn’t help that google has gotten so horrible at being a search engine nowadays. 
 Is there any way I could implement this in C++? Maybe using SDL? Would love to get insight from experienced devs, I’ve only covered C++ to a undergrad level… so I’m clueless if this screen only drawing is possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I was experimenting on the first leet code's problem, and tried some languages; My question is that why C++ STL is much slower than others?
 This is my C++ code:
 ```cpp class Solution { public: vector<int> twoSum(const vector<int>& nums, int target) { unordered_map<int, int> comp; comp.reserve(nums.size() / 8);
  for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) { const int &x = nums[i]; int cmp = target - x; if (comp.find(cmp) != comp.end()) { return { comp[cmp], i }; } comp[x] = i; } return { -1, -1 }; } }; 
 ```
 Which got 4ms runtime. But, here's my rust implementation, which got 0ms runtime:
 ```rust use std::collections::HashMap;
 impl Solution { pub fn two_sum(nums: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> Vec<i32> { let mut comp = HashMap::with_capacity(nums.len());
  for (i, &x) in nums.iter().enumera…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a large Python program which uses C extensions (wxPython / wxWidgets). Its test suite intermittently crashes, ending with Abort trap: 6, which I understand means the C part of the program panicked due to an error condition.
  
There is no stack trace printed when the program aborts, so I don't know where to start looking for the problem.
 The problem is intermittent (25-50% of the time), so I can't use a technique like a Git bisect to determine where the problem was introduced.
 If the problem is memory corruption - which I suspect - even if I found exactly where the crash happened, that wouldn't tell me where the corruption was introduced in the first place.
  
How would folks recommend I approach debugging such a crashing program?

 Anyone else going this route?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Got my masters a year ago. Right when the job market went to shit. Gave up on applying over time and had other stuff come up in life. Figured why weigh myself down more with another 200 job applications this month when I still won’t have a job regardless (slight cynicism but only slight). Fast forward to now: needed money somehow so now I repair engines. I don’t remember the last time I even coded something. 
 This used to be my passion since middle school and an integral part of who I was. Weird to see me not even think about it anymore. 
 I wouldn’t say I’ve totally given up… but I almost wish I didn’t get my masters so I could have gotten a real SWE job a few years ago with ease and have actual work experience so getting a job right now wouldn’t be impossible.
 Thoughts?
 (This message obviously contains some elements of slight exaggeration)
 EDIT: I don’t need “dont give up just keep trying” comments. I am aware of that. I will do so, but not at this time. I am not going to feel guilt about taking a few months off from the process of sending out hundreds of applications per month with a 99.9% rejection rate, or at least not right now I’m not. I’m burned out from doing this for a year straight. If you suggest that I will fail in my career in CS because of this then you are seriously misunderstanding the sentiment of this post. I’m not giving up on my career.
 EDIT2: thank you all for your wide variety of responses and the thoughtfulness you have put into them. I won’t retype all my replies here but I have concluded that I need to try other things than brute force spamming job applications for only SWE/web dev jobs and try to get anything to get my foot in the door + critique and revise my resume according to professional advice. I certainly feel more encouraged than when I first wrote this sleep-deprived post at 4am.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Everyone! So I've been interning at a major company for 5 months now. This is my last month and today I asked my manager when is my final presentation and review. He was clueless about these things. I never had any one on one with my manager and today also I had a one on one because I brought it up in the standup call. I was never assigned any buddy or mentor unlike other interns. Initially for the start two months I was assigned technical work but after that they gave me things like reaching out to people, filling excel sheets etc. Today he told me that I didn't meet his expectations and I didn't go above and beyond for this event that my team hosted (although I worked so hard even for that). He told me he's disappointed. I went and cried, I'm feeling so so bad that he's telling me now that my internship is about to end. Although I do have a full time offer already from this company but what if they rescind the offer? I'm pretty sure I'd be joining some other team as my manager told he has no opening for new grads in their team.
 Sorry for the long post idk what to do

 The result is a first release (v0.1.0) that includes the "piggui" ("piggy" to friends) Iced GUI. It runs on macOS/Linux/Windows hosts (mainly for dev for now, until we get remote GPIO implemented) and more importantly on a Raspberry Pi.

a tool you've written
 a game you've been working on
 your first non-trivial C++ program
  
The rules of this thread are very straight forward:
  
The project must involve C++ in some way.
 It must be something you (alone or with others) have done.
 Please share a link, if applicable.
 Please post images, if applicable.
  
If you're working on a C++ library, you can also share new releases or major updates in a dedicated post as before. The line we're drawing is between "written in C++" and "useful for C++ programmers specifically". If you're writing a C++ library or tool for C++ developers, that's something C++ programmers can use and is on-topic for a main submission. It's different if you're just using C++ to implement a generic program that isn't specifically about C++: you're free to share it here, but it wouldn't quite fit as a standalone post.

 COMPRESSZST=(zstd -c -T0 --ultra -20 -) 
 to for example
 COMPRESSZST=(zstd -c -T0 --fast -) 
 it went from 1 min 40 seconds to 8 seconds. Only downside is that you'll use a little more disk space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I'm currently a senior in college on track to finish all my classes this summer and apply for graduation in fall. I had picked up a job back in march at a small insurance agency to develop a CRM lead management system for the company. The reason I picked up the job was to gain experience. I am the sole developer at my job and I am not going to lie I am gaining a lot of hands on experience primarily with Node.js, React, Azure, Git, REST APIs and a bunch of other things I cant remember to list. I report directly to the agency owner who is non technical, he likes my work and constantly tells me how smart I am but I feel as though he doesn't know what he is doing sometimes. He expects a single college student to build a CRM for his agency with no guidance from a senior engineer. I believe I am doing good work at this job and he thinks im pretty good too but I feel as though he is rushing me constantly asking me for updates on the project and setting deadlines for his employees to start using the CRM by this month. I have never had anyone use software written by me before so I am unsure of how this will pan out and I don't want to be responsible for such a big project in his business. Also I feel like for the amount of responsibility I have I shouldn't be getting paid 15 an hour and due to the fact that I am graduating soon I don't see myself staying here any much longer as 15 an hour wont cut it. When he initially hired me he promised that I can move up in the company and become a manager and that there would be a pay increase. I currently have 4 months of experience working here, what should be my next move?

 Hi, folks. I started writing golang some time ago and I felt the need for some boilerplate to use everytime I started a HTTP server.
 I wrote this trying to make the code idiomatic, as I came from other languages, and there could be still something that is not quite right.
 Additionally, note that I tried to implement it in a Hexagonal Architecture. Even though is very small, I wrote imagining as a large scale project. For small projects I would not write like this and would keep it very simple.
 Finally, this API only creates users and allows logins, but includes many simple features:
  
Centralized encoding and decoding
 Centralized error handling
 Access and Refresh Tokens
 Logging middleware with UIDs for each request
 Authentication middleware
  
Feel free to point out any mistakes or suggest best practices that I could improve in my code.

 I recently started a new project and decided to go with razor pages for the ui layer. However there is a little confusion going on as i don't know how to handle the forms. Should i go full ajax for better ux, or handle it traditionally via form submits.
 For the record i always work with mvc projects and for the most part i use ajax to call controllers under /ajax route.
 Would appreciate your thoughts on this.

 But after a reboot when all network cache etc are cleared, it always takes ages for the drives to be mapped. Sure I have set the mapping to persistent programmatically, but ideally I want the app to be super fast at all times. 
 Is there a way to solve this issue programmatically or is it impossible and just part of Windows? I'm already using the Synology API for authentication, enumeration. Only the drives the user can access are enumerated (ABE). 
 Everything works but this. And it's annoying me to no end, I've spent hours on this to no avail

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, It is often said that C++ is faster than other fully compiled coding languages like Go.
 Some of the reasons given are things like cpp not having array bounds checks, c++ compiler having been optimized for decades, and the fact that other newer languages like Go having GC.
 My question is regarding this GC part. How is Go’s GC much different from smart pointers in C++, and how does GC make the performance of Go slower than C++? What is it doing different than smart pointers automatic cleanup in C++?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[20+ yoe and I've recently run into this new experience, a relatively junior engineer who uses metaphor almost exclusively when trying to communicate concepts. They seem to do this at the expense of being decipherable. When I ask them about how they're planning about implementing a client side rate limiter, they immediately talk about number of cars on a highway; asking about idempotency in batch job processing results in an answer about starting to play a DVD over from the beginning. 
 I don't have any issue in using metaphor to try to explain a concept that isn't landing, or when speaking to someone less technical, but I've never run into someone who wouldn't, even when pressed, talk about the technical question at hand like this.
 Has anyone run into this kind of thing? Any pointers or reading suggestions? I'd love to figure out how to get better at communicating with them. As it is I need to stifle a response of "Shaka, when the walls fell" because I'm fairly sure they won't get the reference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coders in open source have a unique challenge compared to other software projects, they have to do EVERYTHING from UI to quality assurance. Software teams have many members who can't code because it's not reasonable to expect them to be jack of all trades, it's an unrealistic burden.
 This also hurts the software quality itself. Are you a solid UI designer but can't code? Too bad. Know how to make software accessible for the disabled, but can't code? Too bad. Got an amazing idea everyone would want but can't code? Oh well.
 Open soft contributions are made through commits. Non-coders can make issues, but not commits. They can bring up issues or ideas, but the ones who code have to actually want to implement them.
 So how do we make it so that people like UI designers and such can actually contribute their skills?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For proposes of optimisation a compiler already tries to find out what values a variable can have:
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { /*optimised away because i is guaranteed to be smaller than 10*/ if (i == 10) return -1; … } 
 Is there anyway in a mainstream compiler to extract that information? My first idea of how this might be implemented is something like this:
 static_assert(_proven_impossible(i == 10));
 In the above example the following would hypothetically cause a compiler error, because the programmer’s assumption about their code could be proven incorrect at compile time:
 static_assert(_proven_possible(i == 15));
 But maybe it’s possible to get a printout of possible and impossible ranges (as far as the compiler knows) for specific variables at specific points in the program:
 _known_possible_ranges(i);
 Also maybe there are tools that can do this?
 Edit:
 Several People seem to have misunderstandings about my question, this may be my fault, so I want to make this clear:
 My question is NOT about TELLING the compiler what is possible, I know about things like _builtin_assume, _builtin_unreachable my question is if there is a way to EXTRACT INFORMATION which states the compiler could prove that my program can or can never reach, some kind of assert macro that works on non constant expressions but is still evaluated at compile time. I also know that this can not always be done, some things that the compiler can’t prove are impossible will still be impossible, due to the halting problem, but the compiler in practice already proves some situations to be possible/impossible for optimisation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take the most simple idea you can possibly imagine.
 Simplify it more, it's still way too complicated.
 Don't start from making art. Do a playable prototype using most basic 2d or 3d shapes. Gameplay first. There are some exceptions, but this approach wouldn't hurt them either.
 Make sure the prototype you've made is good enough to reflect your desired gameplay on 80-90%.
 After - look at your prototype with a very new look, and think once again of the MOST simple art style that could represent your idea "well enough". Replace simple shapes with some assets. Don't be afraid of using Assetstore or other places to buy/get your assets if they fit. No-one really cares about their originality as long if it fits and it's fun.
 Register pages for all important social media the day you start. Post everything you do there, start getting some followers. Remember, making a game is always much longer process then you expect, the game you want to make in 2 weeks may take 2 month, may take 2 years. Before you finish - you'll have some audience to start with. If you start late - you will regret not starting at once. It will take months of daily posting just to make it a habit, so it's much better to start at day 1.
 The hardest thing in making a game is 'completing and releasing' it. Make this your main goal and priority. Everything else goes second.
  
p.s. This strategy works not only for the 1st game, but I'd stick to it in general. With your own corrections, based on the experience you've got making previous projects.

 My question is what can I do to best prepare for a C# development role? The whole C# eco-system seems a little confusing and I wonder what the best route is for someone versed in the technologies I mentioned.
 Here's two relevant points from the job spec, if they help at all:
  
Develop User Stories etc using MS DevOps/Jira and participate in Sprint Planning and delivery.
 Develop software applications using Microsoft C# and other technologies such as ASP.NET, SQL Server, Azure etc.
  
Thanks a lot in advance!

It's incredibly hard for me to concentrate on job activities that I don't find interesting but are nevertheless a part of my job.
 I see other developers jumping into literally everything our managers and POs throw at them, pushing forward to finish tasks, and participating in all sorts of non-mandatory internal communities. For me, it feels like I have a very narrow set of interests and specific preferences related to my job. Here are some examples:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently have something like this for configuring derived classes from a base class:
 class Base { virtual ... setConfig(...) {} virtual ... getDefaultConfig(...) { returns empty configuration } ... protected: Config config; } class Derived1 : public Base { } class Derived2 : public Base { ... setConfig(...) override { } ... getDefaultConfig(...) override { } } 
 Now, not every derived class needs to be configured. I would say a better approach would be to have a configuration class that the derived classes inherit from, and check everywhere if the derived class implements the configuration class, instead of just returning an empty configuration from the base class.
 I heard that this is considered bad practice, so is there a better way to do this?

 I am in no way a beginner in C, and so far, I've found some design flaws which could've been prevented if I had thought about the structure of the project beforehand:
  
Making the CPU a global variable to minimize passing it through pointers for every function (even if modern compilers will optimize that)
 Pay more attention to the PC (at the start nothing was working because the PC was reading the address after it instead of the current address)
 Debug before making most of the instructions
  
​
 I just wanted to know if I'm missing something and how to continue after I finish the CPU. I have implemented all official opcodes, don't know if the NES has any additional or uses any unofficial ones.
 ​
 Link to the code
 ​
 There are also some test programs I made with the mass:werk 6502 assembler, which seem to be working fine.

 Correctness
 It was not easy to gather correct numbers, so take them with a grain of salt (like a 10% error margin) - UTMs are not very helpful as they do not take a lot of users into account when calculating wishlists from UTM clicks - but their proportions are somehow correct compared to real WLs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am writing code to heuristically solve a mathematical problem (a network partitioning problem). The code starts with an initial partition, and then tries various strategies (about 15 strategies) to improve the partition.
 Some of these strategies can be used in any order. Some are reasonable to use only after some other ones have been tried. Some can be used inside or outside other strategies.
 These strategies are more or less useful depending on the type of network that is given. Hence, I would like to give the user as much freedom as possible in mixing and matching these strategies, but I am not sure how to best structure that in the code.
 An example: say the strategies are A, B, C, D. Then I would like to user to be able to select:
  
A only
 A then C then B
 B then A then C
 A with C enabled inside, then D, then C again.
 A with C disabled inside, then C.
  
etc. Another complication is that some of these strategies (like A and D) require some data structures to be maintained, while others (like B and C) don't. So if A and D are done consecutive then I don't want to re-build the data structures, but if A and D are not consecutive, then I do want to re-build them.
 Is there any general advice you can give for this situation, or a code base or book I can look at for inspiration?
 Thank you very much.

 I was able to force through a lot of changes that, while they didn't solve the root of the issue, made things less unbearable. At least enough to keep me from rage quitting while I kept looking.
 And now, after several months of looking, I found a new role. Fully remote. Working for a university. First engineer onboarded for standing up a new, really cool project. This means I get to actually build something from scratch with no technical debt from legacy systems and bureaucracies. I get more vacation/paid holidays. And I've already met some brilliant people that I would have otherwise never encountered. 
 I'm still serving my 2 weeks at the old job, but I've basically already handed everything off. Might just take half days until my last day. Been spending the rest of my time writing out the architecture diagrams of how I want to build my dream serverless environment. IAC, automations, and pipelines everywhere. 
 And now I can just get dogs for the house and pet them while getting paid. It all works out.

 We on another hand have to deal with never ending stack that keeps increasing, it was Servers, then virtualization, then docker swarm, then k8s, now k3s is picking up, knative is another thing, you have to know cloud, better know all 3 cuz companies might use all of them, startups on AWS want their code in CDK with Typescript, another one wants that in Python, other ones use CloudFormation, another place uses Ansible, company next door uses Terraform ... i can keep going for hours..
 Sometimes I wish just to quit do some basic work.. I used to love this, but now its.. another day, another feature implemented, wow we implemented argo instead of deploying via pipeline, I mean who give a f#uck, I certainly don't. My grandfather was taking over Berlin on a fuckin Tank in '45, another one was a governor making people lives better, what I will say and remember? I once reduced cost and implemented spot instances, or I wrote really neat terraform module?..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a 3 files in the project:
  
main.cpp
 header.h
 input.cpp
  
input.cpp has a function named "read_file()" which reads a text file and stores data in a vector(this vector has to be global). inside the read_file(), i am initializing a vector as: 
 std::vector<int> data(num); 
 I am reading the data in this vector. Now, in the main.cpp. i am declaring the "data" vector as a global variable outside the main function as:
 std::vector<int> data; 
 Also, in the header.h file, i am declaring this vector as:
 extern std::vector<int> data; 
 My issue is that when i call the function read_file() in main, for checking purpose, i am printing the vector, but it doesnt print anything. I printed the size of the vector, it says 0. I think there is some segmentation fault in this code. 
 PS: I am a complete noob in C++. So, some references regarding use of vectors would also be nice. 
 Thanks.

 Do you recommend me to upgrade to .Net8 ? I'm rather do not & but i have no choice now , the extension required. Net8 in vscode like c# dev kit or .net extension pack and the C# extension that related with C# ev kit.
 Can you please guide me to the right extension to use in my application production. Its so frustrating that i reached this point and i don't know what to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always been seen as a high performer at work - staff level at a couple of smaller companies, etc. What people don't see is the amount of energy and work it takes to keep this up. I don't really relate to people who say they only do a few hours of real work a week (but lucky them).
 I'm at the point where I either quit my job and take a lengthy sabbatical or find a different way to relate to work, organize my work day, or something similar so I can put less overall effort into it. I'm at a small enough company now that people would start to notice if I was slacking but I do wonder if there's a way I could get 80% of the results with a lot less of the effort.
 Does anyone have similar experiences or things that have worked for them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, hope you have a nice sunday;
 short: i have several threads rendering datas to the same vector: nothing is added or removed: only values are modified.
 if i use join() everything works fine but it's useless because each threads wait for the previous one : no parallelism.
 if i use mutex, it works fine too but same story, mutex locks the vector and threads wait for the previous one to unlock the mutex: no parallelism. 
 if i try to Not wait, it doesnt work because it seems i can't write or read from the same vector in different threads at the same time. 
 What options do i have to make multithreading worth here ? 
 Details if you want: 
 i ve been learning c++ for 6 months now but i used javascript and php for years. As an amateur though. So i'm a beginner, don't be too harsh :)
 I ve coded a iteration of conway game of life for educational purpose, it works fine and i'm really happy with it. the actual version runs 100* faster than my first version :). For the record, i use SFML with very simple opengl shader.
 Now i try to speed up the app by using threads : on my mac i can see my application uses 100% cpu but on a mac, its 100% per cores : if you have four cores, maximum is 400%. using threads or not, i have never managed to go beyond 100% (one core) 
 i can uses threads but not in //. how can i do that ?

 To make this exercise pass the test you can recognize its security classification:

 When we make raw system calls and they fail for any reason the man pages document that they return -1
 So how is errno set by the Kernel?
 Or is the -1 actually returned by the libc wrappers and the actual system call only returns errno?

 I'll give my breakdown of them feel free to disagree 😁
 SRP (Single responsibiltity principle) - This one I can see merit in. I like the idea of not overloading classes/modules/methods with too much responsibility. If something has too many jobs it does become more challenging to maintain. Where I have issue with this principle is that it gives no guidelines about where to draw the line between what is a resposibility and what isn't. This is kind of a silly example but I could have a class called "ServiceLayer" and then say "This class has one responsibility which is to manage the apps buisness logic" and at the same time have a series of obsessi…]]></summary>

I read the definitions of the value categories but once I begin programming there is nothing more for me to differentiate between lvalue and rvalue. Can someone explain why there is such sub categories exist.
 I read on the Stroustrup terminology document that there is some differentiation based on identities and movable properties. But the identitiy property make no sense when describing xvalue category, It can has an identity if you convert it from lvalue reference (using std::move) but may not be true if you are returning a prvalue reference.

 I've past 50 and now I find myself on the twilight years of my career and I am kind of interested on how this has played out or how are you planning to play this out?
 I've found a company that can leverage my current business knowledge with a lot of technical debt. 10 years ago I would have walked... But now I am quietly fixing broken stuff and learning the domain and to be frank letting the young guys strut while I keep to myself. I have a long term goal of digging in and slowing down. By 60 I want to go part time and grow a garden or something. 
 So my question is, how does this play out or how do you picture this playing out?

 I'm trying to build a 2-3 tree. But I've encounter a problem that I cannot understand.
 When I pass by reference a pointer of a node pointing to its parent (pUp). The debugging print statement printed out a different pointer with a different address of the pointer itself (so it means that the original memory I put in is gone). Why is it so? I thought that if you pass by reference, you can modify the original memory, not changing it the another memory block.
 This is the log that the program print out:

 I'm a rust newbie. After finishing rustaceans I decided to try implementing a binary tree.
 I struggled a lot trying to get the borrows right, and compiler screamed a lot at me especially when I tried to hold multiple mutable references (forgot they are exclusive). I managed to get it compiled but I'm not satisfied with the insert method as it looks kinda ugly and probably more complex than it should be, and I believe it's unidiomatic. I think a lot of that came from trying not to drop or move a Box, hence the `ref mut`s. Could you mind giving me some guidance? What can i do to make this more idiomatic?
 #[derive(Debug)] pub struct Node<T> { pub value: T, pub left: Option<Box<Node<T>>>, pub right: Option<Box<Node<T>>>, } impl<T> Node<T> { fn new(value: T) -> Self { Node{value: value, left: None, right: None} } } #[derive(Debug)] pub struct BinaryTree<T> where T: PartialOrd { pub root: Option<Box<Node<T>>> } impl<T: PartialOrd> BinaryTree<T> { fn new() -> Self { BinaryTree { root: Option::None } } fn is_empty(&self) -> bool { return self.root.is_none(); } fn insert(&mut self, value: T) { if let Some(ref mut node) = self.root { let mut node = node.as_mut(); loop { if value < node.value { if let Some(ref mut child) = node.left { node = child.as_mut(); } else { let new_node = Box::new(Node::new(value)); node.left = Some(new_node); break; } } else if value > node.value { if let Some(ref mut child) = node.right { node = child.as_mut(); } else { let new_node = Box::new(Node::new(value)); node.right = Some(new_node); break; } } else { break; } } } else { let new_node = Box::new(Node::new(value)); self.root = Some(new_node); } } } fn main() { let mut my_tree = BinaryTree::<i32>::new(); my_tree.insert(5); my_tree.insert(7); my_tree.insert(3); my_tree.insert(10); println!("{:?}", my_tree); }

Then tried fedora, I actually liked it, but the KDE spin is too bloated and dnf is pretty slow for me even after adding parallel downloads and fastestmirror, even using dnf5, the speeds are really REALLY shitty in my country, I guess it's a mirror and region problem not a dnf one. Besides why does it use so many resources on idle??? 2.8gb RAM, that's literally MORE THAN THRICE of what Arch used, Battery Life was also much worse compared to arch, also those ugly windows-esque offline updates at boot really irked me, although I did turn them off. Throw in RedHat/IBM and the excitement goes away. Finally ended up installing a minimal debian and installing pipewire, ufw etc. and the minimal kde desktop on top of it. Debian is where I'm gonna stay, been using it for 3 months and I love it. The workload on my laptop isn't as intense and debian handles it pretty well (I'm a law student, I just open documents and a web browser, I have no time for tinkering or trying out new stuff. I absolutely have to have my laptop working every time I open the lid).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I was hesitant to post this, but I am really disappointed with the cost I paid for Anthony GG's training course. I don't think it was worth the high price, and I wanted to express my thoughts so that others interested in learning Go can see this and make a better-informed decision. While there were some good points, I felt that even these were not very precise. It seemed like the course wasn't taught with a well-prepared and organized mindset.

 I always have been a "passive" learner when switching jobs, like making a few notes here and there but really just focusing on one service at a time. Eventually everything just "falls in place" and I can say that I understand how everything works and interacts with each other. 
 Problem with this is that it's really slow and not very effective. Id love to hear people's strategy on this regard.

 If that is true, then why can we not calculate the length of an array by

 If that is false, then why can we calculate the length by

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quick description of the problem: in unix environments, if you do the following:
 creat("dir/file", ...); // ... unlink("dir/file"); 
 then it's possible that the unlink call deletes something else if dir is a symlink and was changed to point at something else between the creat and unlink call. The usual way to deal with this is to use the *at variants (e.g unlinkat) with a dirfd.
 On windows, if I want to do the same, then it seems like I'll need to use undocumented functions like NtDeleteFileW.
 My question is:
  
Is this even an issue in windows since windows doesn't have "symlinks"?
 If yes, how reliable are these NtDeleteFileW and NtCreateFile functions?

 Now more and more restaurants are contacting me that they want similar service.
 Since functionality is pretty much the same, my first thought was multitenacy (same code different databases using Laravel tenancy package).
 But then I started getting different feature request from all the restaurants(especially on frontend).
 So then I was thinking that I could just clone the DO droplet, and made somekind of CI automation for backend and separate projects for frontend (if needed - basic changes like logo, color and font would be in settings). Not ideal, but less work I guess (at leastn in short term - might regret later :))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/passing-a-function-as-a-parameter-in-cpp/
 ``` // Function that multiplies two // numbers int multiply(int x, int y) { return x * y; }
 // Function that takes a pointer // to a function int invoke(int x, int y, int (*func)(int, int)) { return func(x, y); } ```
 So, to start off, this would be the function declaration of invoke() WITH the parameter names
 int invoke(int x, int y, int (*func)(int, int));
 What would be the function declaration for invoke function WITHOUT the optional parameter names? Would it be this?
 int invoke(int, int, int(int, int) );
 but quick ChatGPT answer says it's wrong and it's this:
 int invoke(int, int, int (*)(int, int));
 But how come in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_vexing_parse
 Timer() in TimeKeeper time_keeper(Timer());
 interpreted as a pointer to function with return type Timer and doesn't need (*)?
 Why isn't it TimeKeeper time_keeper(Timer (*)());?

 Long story short, I have 3 years of experience as a SWE. I was considered a good performer on my team until we got a new manager a few months ago. The new manager has been more demanding and I’ve made some careless mistakes that have resulted in buggy code and suddenly I’m one of the worst performers on my team. I’ve gotten negative feedback in our one on ones several times. I wouldn’t be surprised if I get PIP’ed/fired soon.
 My question is, have you ever been fired? How did it work out for you? What did you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm getting an error stating a LINQ expression can't be translated, but I'm not quite sure why that is. Any thoughts?
 // Example entity: public class Entity { [Key] public Guid Id { get; set; } = Guid.NewGuid(); [JsonIgnore] [Column(Name = nameof(Slugs)] public string SlugCsv { get; set; } = ""; [NotMapped] public string[] Slugs { get => SlugCsv.Split(','); set => SlugCsv = string.Join(',', value); } // (Multiple slugs are supported, so outdated slugs can still redirect properly) } // FluentValidation extension method to ensure all slugs are unique: public static class RuleExtensions { public static IRuleBuilderOptions<TEntity, TEntity> UniqueSlugs<TEntity>(this IRuleBuilder<TEntity, TEntity>, DbContext context) { return ruleBuilder .Must(entity => !context.Set<TEntity>() .Any(e => e.Id != entity.Id && entity.Slugs.ToList().Any(slug => e.Slugs.Contains(slug)) ) ) .WithMessage($"'nameof(Entity.Slugs)' must contain unique slugs."); } } 
 I've tried using Entity.Slugs as the array, casting it as a List, IEnumerable, and IQueryable. No luck. Not quire sure what I need to do to make this LINQ expression proper. There's no red errors in the code, it compiles fine. It's only a runtime issue.
 Any ideas?

 EDIT:
 Great advice from everyone! Thank you. I am having fun playing on the recommended typing sites. I guess I won't worry too much about the typing and I will concentrate more on becoming a better coder/problem solver. *Now if I could only find an affordable, heavy duty keyboard that won't fade or break after only a year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built an app from scratch using C# for the most part and 2-3% powershell. The app first connects to a server, fetches all the available network shares, and tries to map them persistently. Depending on how many accesses the user has, some of them will not be mapped, or all of them. Etc. Also all these actions are logged into a txt file found in the native folder of the app.
 So I've been testing the app and including all the logging, the app took 13s to persistently map 16 shares. 
 I've also tried relying on native Windows APIs instead to make it faster but that just made it slower lol
 A few notes:
 I do NOT want async mapping as that would break the real-time progress text ((share name) mapped succesfully!). 
 Async logging also seems to break the app. 
 There's a function to pre-connect to the file server so if you use domain name instead of IP, the app won't be slowed down which would normally occur in the event of using domain name instead of IP
 I'm running out of ideas.
 Mind you, I have my IDE on a VM not on my host PC for a couple of reasons. 1) snapshots are super helpful and ofc I always back up working code into an encrypted location on my NAS; 2) I don't want to clutter my physical PC with dev stuff tbh. VMs just seem cleaner in this regard but that might be me
 Can someone supply me with good ideas as to what I should try to improve the speed of the app?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infrastructure-as-code is nice, but what are the best approaches to perform tests (unit, integration, regression) tests on this code? Let's say you have a reasonably complex mix of AWS Cloudformation, some Ansible, and a few random scripts. The entire infra may consist of a few DBs and servers, some Lambdas, various event sources, etc. Nothing even too outrageous and complex.
 What's the best way to test your code (Ansible playbooks, Cloudformation templates, scripts) for correctness?
 There is, of course, always the nuclear option: Have a separate test/dev account, spin it all up there, and then perform end-to-end testing with artificial clients (for example). Also, test that an existing system (old version) can be upgraded with the latest version of your infra-code.
 But those deployments can take a long time. And unless each developer has their own account for experimentation, you need to deal with the test/dev account being a bottleneck, etc.
 So, aside from that, what are some other approaches or strategies that you have found to be useful?

 Also looking for a way to swap string out for something else on name if it would just be easier to use string then I will but I am trying to keep this as performant as possible as it will be added to a GUI
 Any knowledge on how I could go about this would be much appreciated thanks. Oh also any comments in the code are just where I was making tasks for myself

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A total noob here, sorry if the issue is trivial or if I failed to provide enough details here.
 The snippet of code in question (it was a Caesar cipher as an exercise for an intro to C):
 int txtlen = strlen(plaintext); // Plaintext was obtained from user via prompt printf("txtlen: %i\n", txtlen); // This line miraculously solved the extra // ��'s otherwise appearing after the end // of my ciphertext array printed as string. // But only if added before the array declaration char ciphertext[txtlen]; // Encoding here, filling in the array char by char; worked fine. printf("ciphertext: %s\n", ciphertext); // The �� appeared here, after // the correctly encoded ciphertext 
 I did eventually find a sane solution (adding a '\0' at the end of my array), but this printf magic still bugs me. How is this possible?
 (This was in a cloud environment Visual Studio Code for CS50, if that's relevant. I'm afraid I don't know the type of compiler used or other specs)
 Added to clarify: I eventually figured out that the issue was with printf failing to find nul at the end of my ciphertext and going beyond it into no man's memory. What I can't understand is why my debugging printf of length somehow accidentally fixed this before I knew to terminate the array with \0.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Link to the crate
 I created this tool after having tried to bisect some rustc bugs a while ago, and discovering that there wasn't an easy way to limit the amount of memory a program can use in a multi-platform way (I'm working on Windows at home). There are a bunch of methods to do that on Linux, but I feel like they're a bit contrived and part of a greater ecosystem of limits that may not really be easy to use in the context of cargo-bisect-rustc.
 With this program, you can specify the maximum amount of memory a command can use before it gets killed (of course, if it doesn't go over that limit, then everything goes normally). If needed, you can follow children too and assert that the sum of all memory consumed by all of them doesn't go over the limit. You can also switch between RSS memory and virtual memory, if needed. So, for example:
 $ memlimit 16GiB -c cargo install ripgrep --force 
 This will:
  
set a limit of 16GiB (gibibytes, 16 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 bytes)
 with -c, follow all children spawned by the initial program and sum up their memory usage
 monitor the command cargo install ripgrep --force
  
I know this isn't a really impressive or important tool, but I felt there wasn't an easy-to-use multiplatform tool to do this. It's very small and doesn't have a lot of features, so I'm super open to criticism and suggestions!

 Can't get my head around building a state machine, every time I implement something or get close I'm getting undefined types or for some reason getting a place where the compiler is trying to turn an object type into an int. Obviously coming from higher level the concept of pointers is new, I've followed two tutorials from https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/implementing-a-finite-state-machine-in-cpp/
 And https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state/cpp/example
 Compiler is definitely working, ran a bunch of checks with headers and using main just to make sure something wasn't erroring out due to paths. 
 Ive looked on github but they're never the pattern with the states as types, if anybody can point me towards some code that definitely works it would be massively appreciated. I get the whole dev world is figure it out for yourself but it's got to the point where I feel like I understand something, hit compile and reality just slaps me in the face 😂

 I'd like to ask you for some feedback, as I am conflicted about the situation that happened on my work.
 I am a Technical Lead in one older company, that went through the process of digitalization and is growing rapidly at the moment. I've started 8 months ago. 
 The product I am working on is a part of a larger suite (think of a big monolith, kind-of decoupled in some ways, but ultimately monolith). The whole suite had its Feature Flags managed by a single Engineering Manager (not in my vertical), using a commercial tool. This cause the obvious, him holding every other team back, if he, or his deputies are not available. He owned the account and shared his password with a few other deputies.
 As the product suite grew, there are many teams working on it, each in need of it…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need some help here. Basically I've found that one of the biggest wifi providers in my country uses a combination of a set prefix and the last few letters of the wifi name as a default password. I think that's still okay AS LONG AS THEY TELL PEOPLE TO CHANGE IT. I remember when we got our wifi, they just gave us the password and said that that was the one we needed to use. No recommendation to change the password or how we could do so. I had to do it myself once I realised that anyone could easily log into my wifi. Now I've tested this default password on every wifi network of the same provider I've come across. I've connected to around 20 of them and only one had changed their password. This is extremely dangerous because it's a (basically) open port to any wifi(one of the largest providers here btw) that can easily be exploited...
 So are the default passwords similarly set up where you live?
 I'd love to hear from you guys. I can say that as far as I've seen, in europe the passwords are randomly generated.
 Any advice is welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 Something a bit wild happened to me, and I wanted to share the story. So, a few days ago, I bricked my laptop during a routine system update. I'm not sure what happened, my guess is it hibernated at a critical time of the system update.
 So, I pull out my trusted USB Arch installer, mount my ssh, arch-chroot, rerun the update to try and fix it, it runs successfully, all well and good. 
 I reboot, and the boot sequence welcomes me with a message about my lvm partition being corrupted. I try to let the repair tool run, but to no avail: my system has about 0.5% of my blocks corrupted. Instead of trying to repair it, I decide that the easiest way forward is to do a fresh install. 
 Here's the catch. I had a 10h plane trip planned for months 2 days later. Well, if I have 10h to kill, maybe I can use it to reinstall Arch? I check online, and internet access on the plane is not too expensive, so... Why the heck not. 
 Fast forward today, as soon as we take off, I start the install, using my mobile phone as a hotspot (to avoid having to deal with signing into the plane wifi website directly) and a Arch Wiki browser. As usual, it takes me a few tries to get a bootable system, but I get there! 
 It was a very interesting experience, because with a very slow connection, I had to be very careful and minimalistic about which packages I install. I now have a simple KDE Plasma + a browser running on Arch, all at 30k feet above ground.

 void Scene::CreateDriversAndCars() { for (size_t i = 0; i < 10; i++) { auto car = std::make_unique<Car>(); auto driver = std::make_unique<Driver>(); driver->SetCar(car.get()); m_Cars.push_back(std::move(car)); m_drivers.push_back(std::move(driver)); } } private: std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Car>> m_Cars; std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Driver>> m_drivers; class Driver { public: Driver() {} void SetCar(Car *car) { this->m_car = car; } } private: Car* m_car; 
 What my intention is:
 -ownership should stay in the scene
 -I want to hold a reference of the car in the driver. So driver can call car->accelerate() etc.
 In this case scene has ownership of the cars. Which can be destroyed or created. The question is: is this right approach? Or pointless to use pointers? I know there is no "correct" way to do this but I'm very please to hear your opinions about this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm coming from the natural sciences/pure math to learn basic programming because my professor told me that it's a non-negotiable for scientists in these times. I've tried getting into it countless times in the past. My most formal experience with it was taking AP Computer Science A in high school, which was just simple Java, but my teacher for that course sucked because she didn't actually teach us how to set up coding environments. We basically used a website where we could just throw in the code and get an output. Just an online IDE.
 Now I'm not the most literate when it comes to computers, so when I hear all the jargon about "shells" and "Unix" and whatever else, I instantly want to run away. It took me a long time to even know what an IDE was. And God knows how to operate Github (or what it even is...). All these "introductory" courses expect me to know the basics of computers, but I'm so lost. 
 It's frustrating because I know how to write actual code (logic comes easy to me). When I know how to set things up, I actually enjoy it. I just feel like the biggest dumba** out there when it comes to setting up the environment.
 I think I suck at knowing "how" to learn programming. I know how to teach myself math, science, etc., but you could never successfully leave me alone to learn code. I don't know where to go, or what to look for. Someone please give me advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's the most common complaint people have after switching to Linux? "Where are all my proprietary Windows/macOS software?" That's why if you get them to switch to FOSS on their proprietary operating systems first, the eventual switch will be much more seamless. And the great thing is that FOSS developers don't gatekeep their software from Windows/macOS (unlike the other way around), so they can install pretty much every free and open source software out there.
 How do I know this method works? Because it's how I fell in love with FOSS and Linux. I needed a way to remux a video file and all the options out there were paid. Until I came upon ffmpeg, which allowed you to not only remux video, but to do pretty much anything with it. It seemed too good for something that good to be free. That's when I looked into it and learned about free and open source software. After that I slowly switched all of my software to free and open source alternatives, until the only proprietary thing left on my PC was Windows itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have these two types in a COM interop library that I work with often:
 https://docs.sw.siemens.com/documentation/external/PL20220830878154140/en-US/api/content/SolidEdgePart~PartDocument_members.html
 https://docs.sw.siemens.com/documentation/external/PL20220830878154140/en-US/api/content/SolidEdgePart~SheetMetalDocument_members.html
 They mostly share the exact same members as they represent two basically interchangeable file formats. I'm writing a library to wrap this API and make it more manageable through some helper and extension methods. I would like to write an adapter interface that will allow people to use common methods on collections of these files without writing two code paths to detect and execute based on the file type.
 I tried letting Rider implement all the members automatically in my adapter classes but it did a really poor job with all the method parameters set as objects. I'm looking into using T4 templates to generate the code automatically. Is that the best option or is there something else I should check out that's quicker to implement?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've noticed a recurring trend among developers, a strong aversion to bad code and poor practices. Many developers seem to loathe legacy code and show little interest in approaching it as just another problem to solve. Instead, they often prefer to quit their job rather than deal with it.
 I've seen numerous instances where, when someone asks for advice on how to manage legacy code, the common response is to jump ship and start looking for a new job. This strikes me as an immature attitude, and I initially thought it was primarily a characteristic of less experienced developers. However, I've encountered senior developers with 10+ years of experience who have also quit because they couldn't handle legacy code.
 Why do you think there is such a strong aversion to bad code and legacy systems among developers?

 I'm excited to introduce my new Neovim plugin, impl.nvim, designed to streamline the process of implementing interfaces in Go.
 Key Features:
  
Generate Interface Lists: 
 :ImplGenerate stdlib: Ge a list of all interfaces in the Go standard library.
 :ImplGenerate project: Generate a list of interfaces in your current git repository.
 
 Fuzzy Find and Implement: 
 Place your cursor on a type definition and run :ImplSearch to fuzzy find available interfaces.
 Select an interface, and the necessary methods will be added to your type automatically.
 
  
Please check it out on GitHub and let me know what you think! I'm relatively inexperienced with both Golang and Neovim, so constructive criticism is more than welcome :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, just did the canva engineer OA for grad 2025 and I am bummed, it just feels no matter what I do I will never break into FAANG or big tech, I get its not everyone goal but it is mine, for the money of course. I have been doing as much leetcode as I can as I before I finish off uni
 I asked around previous hires about the OA and what to prep, and they mentioned it was dom manipulation or what not but all I got was leetcode mediums and 1 hard. I managed to solve one and another one 14/15 test cases but last one did not have time to complete so it is half solved.
 Also I hate how RNG plays a part in these OA, I had a friend that told me his questions were like 1 LC medium and 2 LC easy, one was some simple string manipulation and another a simple hashmap solution both less than 20 lines while I got shafted rip, 
 Pairing all this with the constant rejections from other companies, and the occasional reach final stage to only be rejected, it gets depressing every now and then.
 Just needed an outlet to rant, sorry to put more negativity into this thread. I will keep on grinding for sure and get better at my problem solving abilities and not give up of course and keep applying elsewhere, wishing everybody luck!!

I'd ask the instructor what to do, but someone else has already asked the same question a week ago and so far there's been no answer. Someone asked a similar question a year ago and the answer wasn't very satisfactory, either. The steps I followed were these:
  
Download and unzip mingw64
 Move mingw64 to C drive
 Add mingw64/bin to environment variable 'Path'
 Test it by running g++ --version and clang++ --version in Powershell
  
g++ works just fine, it prints the information I'm supposed to get. But clang++ prints nothing, it just pauses a second and then jumps to the next line.
 Would be grateful for any help. Pleas ELI5, I'm very new.

 Hi guys, I'm a software engineer with almost 3 yoe. I'm a Java dev mostly. I've recently done some Jenkins work in my team. My project doesn't have any DevOps components. No docker. No k8s. No cloud. But in aws certified solutions architect associate. I'm interested in DevOps and Automation and want to move to such a role. 
 But I'm facing challenges in getting calls from recruiters. I'm not getting past screening rounds. 
 I got 1 interview but midway he realised I'm not a DevOps guy and haven't done k8s work so interview terminated. 
 Right now I'm going through my udemy course to learn more k8s and at least add 1 deployment on my cv. 
 What should I do in my situation? It's been more than 3 months I'm trying for switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seems that the problem with checked exceptions is not about how verbose they are or how bad they scale (propagate) in the project, nor how ugly they make the code look or make it hard to write code. It is that you simply can't enforce someone to handle an error 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐲, despite enforcing dealing with the error at compile time.
 Although the intention is good, as Brian Goetz said once:
  
Checked exceptions were a reaction, in part, to the fact that it was too easy to ignore an error return code in C, so the language made it harder to ignore
  
yet, static checking can't enforce HOW those are handled. Which makes almost no difference between not handling or handling exceptions but in a bad way. Hence, it is inevitable to see people doing things like "try {} catch { /* do nothing */ }". Even if they handle exceptions, we can't expect everyone to handle them equally well. After all, someone just might deliberately want to not handle them at all, the language should not prevent that either.
 Although I like the idea, to me, checked exceptions bring more problems than benefits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As many C++ developers are interested in performance analysis, I would like to share perf-cpp, our library dedicated to recording performance counters directly within C++ applications.
 perf-cpp functions as a wrapper for the "perf_event_open" system call, allowing precise measurement and analysis from your C++ applications (and for specific code segments instead of recording the entire application).
 Key Features:
  
Targeted Performance Counters: Record and analyze metrics specifically tailored to particular code segments.
 Event Sampling: Detailed capture of events such as data accesses, instruction pointers, and branch records, providing deep performance insights.
  
We used the library already in several research-related projects and we are hoping that it can be of service to someone else as well. I value any feedback, ideas, or pull requests to further refine perf-cpp.
 You can find the library and a bunch of examples on GitHub: https://github.com/jmuehlig/perf-cpp

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been reading this subreddit for a while, both from the grads, and the much more experienced people, who I generally agree with it (if I don't, it's usually because they've taken quite a different career path). I see an awful lot of hang-wringing about what job to take, what to study, all that kind of stuff. 
 Here's my advice - learn about personal finance - no, really - some of the best advice you'll find anywhere is here on reddit. You might not care now, but you'll thank me in 10-15 years, especially if you plan to buy a house. Take care of your health - once you get older, medical costs become a significant cost no matter your insurance, and worse if you don't take care of yourself. 
 Oh, you wanted career advice? Don't worry, that will come to you in time. Don't overthink it - it's a long road. Take care of yourself first. 
 P.S. You can safely ignore 100% of advice on Linkedin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Link: https://github.com/iboukhss/ft_printf
 I just finished one of my school projects in which I had to write my own printf function (subject is in the repo if you're interested). And I would be very interested in hearing your feedback on the code overall. 
 Just to be clear, this is technically not like the real printf because it doesn't use file streams, so maybe consider it more like a dprintf to stdout. I have no idea how file streams work but I don't think it would be very hard to change that if I wanted to. 
 Liberal inspiration was taken from from this post, all the heavy lifting was done there, I just added the va_arg parsing and the logic for the flags. 
 Any feedback would help because I have no idea if I have taken bad approaches on this project or if the code is even readable.
 My main concern is the testing approach I have taken, I think it is pretty bad, it was tedious to wrote and is very error prone, so there might be bugs in my code I'm not even aware of.
  
Note: the coding convention is not my own, it is my school's, so the code will probably look very weird to most of you, I personally don't like it but that's just how it is.. 
 Try not to take stylistic choices too much into consideration if you review my code but absolutely feel free to point out odd things or stuff you would not recommend doing in general. 
 Here is a very brief (not exhaustive) summary of the coding guidelines I had to work with: 
  
4 spaced tabs for indentation
 25 lines per function max
 80 columns max
 5 functions per .c file max
 4 named parameters per function max
 C89 style variable declarations
 for loops, switch case, goto are forbidden
  
If you want a good laugh I can also send you the entire pdf lol.

Why don't they just use the rand() API provided by the standard C library for getting random numbers? Is it because using the getticks() function helps mitigate the overhead associated with calling the rand() API?

 If the OS takes 4 bytes for continous reading , why char arrays padding does not take place? I understand that int arrays don't need it because they are in 4 bytes multiples. but what about char arrays ? They are not in multiples of 4 so they should have padding just like classes and structs .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good day. Just a brief introduction of myself. I'm an IT Programmer working for a manufacturing company for less than a year. This is my 1st job and throughout my tenure so far, my team and I are using a low-code software that allows us to finish web-based projects for production in less than a month.
 Last month I was told I will be moved to a new branch of IT. Because of this, I was told to study ASP.NET MVC. I will be mentored by a foreign senior IT. However, the mentoring was not as sophisticated as I imagined. They gave me no online courses, there are no curriculums, and they told me to just Google any technical-related stuff. I asked where will I learn jQuery and my mentor just gave me the link to the jQuery website. So, my learning was not structured. I hop from one article to another to learn ASP.NET MVC and watch different teachers in YouTube, and via reading the system code written in ASP MVC. It was not a fun experience, but in the end I achieved their expectations. Because of this, they made me the leader. 
 Now for my scenario, since I know ASP.NET, they now tasked me to create a curriculum for new IT's that will be working/learning from me. I imagined my IT Head/Manager is better suited for this task because he likely knows a lot of programming in general or what the business needs, but he pushed this task on me for reasons I don't know. Since my learning was unmodulated and unstructured, and I know for a fact that the way they made me learn C# ASP.NET MVC was not for everyone, I'm utterly clueless on what online course will be effective in gearing new IT's for application development in C# be it ASP.NET or desktop application. The company is paying whatever it may be so there's that. All I know is this... whatever course it may be, it must have a certificate at the end, so the new IT's can put it in their personal website or resume for their future jobs, unlike me.
 I'm utterly clueless. Can anyone suggest? Thank you...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to write an event handler for keyboard input using GLFW. I thought I would create an unordered map with <key, \*callbackfunction> entries. Each key (an int defined by GLFW_KEY_*) has a corresponding callback function. I would just reference the appropriate key in the map to get the function associated with that key. 
 I'm having a lot of trouble getting it up. At first I created the unordered map and tried to just insert callback functions, but because they're member function of class Camera and don't have an associated object yet, and because the functions are non-static, I can't do that. So, I'm trying to use lambda functions to get the map populated. Here is the code that I have so far:
 std::unordered_map<int, std::function<void()>> cameraKeyBindings; void Camera::insertCallbackFunction(int key, void(Camera::*)() function) { cameraKeyBindings.insert(key, [this, function]() {(this->*function)(); }); } void Camera::setcameraKeyBindings() { insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_W, &Camera::linearAccelerationUp); insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_A, &Camera::linearAccelerationLeft); insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_S, &Camera::linearAccelerationDown); insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_D, &Camera::linearAccelerationRight); } 
 The main problem right now is that there appears to be something wrong with the syntax:
 void(Camera::*)() 
 My compiler gives this error:
 error: expected ‘,’ or ‘...’ before ‘function’
 void insertCallbackFunction(int key, void(Camera::*)() function);
 Unfortunately from what I can find, that seems to be the correct way to declare a member function pointer. What am I supposed to write instead?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a program that does this:
 1) read configs and get IP numbers. 2) spawn a go routine for each config which has an unique IP in it 3) Fetch some data in each goroutine from these IP and write some files locally (unique per IP) 4) Return some information to main so it can be printed out and then exit program.
 Issue here is at sometimes the write to the ”information” map causes race condition and dead locks.
 What is the most simple way to solve this? Just add some sync.Mutex at critical places? It adds a little overhead timewise though not critical. A more elegant approach is to send all this data back to main using a channel? Main just sits waiting for all goroutines to complete and then print the information and exit.

 int countDigits(int num) { if (num == 0) return 0; return 1 + countDigits(num / 10); } int res = 0; int recurArmstrong(int num, int originalNum) { if (num > 0) res += (pow(num % 10, countDigits(originalNum)) + recurArmstrong(num / 10, originalNum)); else return originalNum == res; } 
 I tried printing the value of res and figured it out that it isn't incrementing. How do I make this work? Any suggestions? Thanks!

 Work on setting up complex mechanics. Very intense work.
 Yet you push through it as needed for weeks on end.
 But once the basic mechanics are set up. And now that it comes "the easy part".
 You get bored, and feel like moving to the next challenge.
 This happens to me especially past beyond the most challenging programming parts.
 So when it comes to then making it a finished project, and with all the details.
 I get bored. And my brain starts imagining new projects and ideas.
 I literally have to force myself to work on it. Using pomodoros to stay motivated.
 I think this is because my favourite part of gamedev is programming, yet also the most challenging for me too. And I tend to see the other parts as easier, not so challenging, yet still time consuming.
 Making a mechanic work gives me a lot of joy. Whereas loading in some assets, or fixing those sprite animations, not so much. I feel like im learning little when I work on stuff outside of programming.

Taking classes and doing whatever I can to get ahead and learn new things. I became a UI Artist, UX designer after spending 10 years doing graphic design. I picked up character art and took classes because I enjoyed 3D work. And eventually made the leap to doing UI in games. ( Mostly Unity ).
 And it dawned on me ( a few times ). That the amount of effort it takes to get a job. The amount of effort it takes to keep up with new software. The endless art test that dont go anywhere. And for what? A Job that MIGHT last for 2-3 years? Fighting for $80-$90k a year?
 I feel like I wasted my life whenever I compare myself to my friends. An example is my friend Mel. She does "Territory Development". And she makes $100k plus commission + Bonus of $17k+. So, she easily makes $200k a year in Texas. She never has to spend a moment outside of work studying for anything. She doesnt have to fight for work or do all that crap we do. And the worst part is she tells me how she just manages a few clients, answers questions and offers them suggestions for building stuff. And the company she works with has a team that does the rest. She gets to travel, never has to worry about not having healthcare. Can easily afford her new $400k Home. ( we arent talking Cali or NY big city numbers either ). 
 Being 36, im just tired of not being able to have the confidence to buy a home because I cant figure out if the damn publisher is going to lay us all off. Or how many months I have to save for because I know I will be unemployed and that is the closest I will get to a vacation because im too worried about being laid off during my PTO. How is our industry the biggest in the country and yet we all seem to be struggle so much and work soo hard and dedicate soo much of our own time for almost nothing.

 I just spent 8 hours across 4 days failing to import the pyperclip module to follow along with Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, by Al Sweigart. 
 My PC had a few different versions of Python installed, and even after using the uninstall wizard in my control panel I still had Python files on my PC that it simply wasn't removing. I could download the module, and it even showed up when I used pip freeze. But I couldn't import it. 
 I watched the video by Python Programmer and learned how to make virtual environments on my PC to control my Python projects. I also learned you could use Python in the command prompt and test simple commands, which is pretty sick. 
 I now have more control over my projects, a better understanding of the command line and its usefulness, and my programs aren't broken in half anymore. Also, I ran a program that imports the pyperclip module and I didn't get the error telling me the module can't be found. I've been seeing this error nonstop for 4 days dude. I can finally rest.

 I’ve tried explaining that prestige isn’t the end all, and that cs majors from gatech actually make more money anyways.
 Give me your honest advice. I enjoy going to tech and I love the people here. Do I take this leap.

 So I'm using Microsoft Learn and I'm on the "Formating output character using escape sequences". The excercise is telling me to type: 
 Console.WriteLine("Generating invoices for customer \"Contoso Corp\" ...\n");
 Console.WriteLine("Invoice: 1021\t\tComplete!");
 Console.WriteLine("Invoice: 1022\t\tComplete!");
 Console.WriteLine("\nOutput Directory:\t");
 I typed:
 Console.WriteLine("Generating invoices for customer \"Contoso Corp\" ...\n"); Console.WriteLine("Invoice: 1021\t\tComplete!"); Console.WriteLine("Invoice: 1022\t\tComplete!"); Console.WriteLine("\nOutput Directory:\t"); 
 But it's just saying "No Output" as the result, instead of what it's supposed to say. I can't find the error.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have some lines like this in my code. This is part of a process which creates rows in a DB based on an input Excel file and other info from the DB. My boss wants the calculation of these final fields to be very flexible so formulas for some of them are stored on the DB as C# scripts.
 //Set up the formula execution string formula = config.Formula; var options = ScriptOptions.Default.AddReferences(typeof(ConsolidatedTBRow).Assembly); var globals = new ScriptGlobals { row = tbRow }; //Execute the formula value = CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync<object?>(formula, options, globals: globals).Result.ToString(); 
 The problem is that when using a real input file, this code runs 4 times for each of the 38k rows in the input file. And, apparently, each time you run Evaluate on a CSharpScript it creates a process that then is not disposed of. This is causing memory to balloon a crazy amount until I get an out of memory error.
 I've seen a lot of other people mention this issue online but can't find any solutions. I found one fairly complicated one here but this doesn't seem to allow passing parameters to the script (my row variable) which I need to be able to do.
 EDIT: I ended up using DynamicExpresso instead of Roslyn. Not only did it solve my issue, it's also easier to use and my program runs insanely faster. Like, it used to take over an hour to run, and it just finished in about 10 minutes. I can't believe this library didn't come up when I was searching for how to run dynamic scripts in C#

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m making a program using WinForms. I kinda stumbled on this accidentally, but I do see that a BindingList of type Part (an abstract class I made for my program) can take classes derived from Part. 
 Example: I have two derived classes- SmallPart and BigPart. They are both the same but SmallPart has weight and BigPart has serial number. Despite having a field not in common, I’m able to collect both of those instances. See: they both inherit Part but are not actually Part objects…? 
 What really got me thinking is I use the BindingList in my data grid view- only the fields that are in common I.e. the Part fields are displayed. 
 Obviously I can see it’s only displaying the Part class fields and not the derived characteristics, but I am curious for more details and rules here. I am not sure what to Google, since I don’t even know the functionality I’m describing lol…

 The reason Im asking is because technology is genuinely my only passion, I mean, in the sense that I enjoy learning about it, listening to podcasts, reading articles etc. i cannot, CANNOT do that with anything else and idk if that’s an issue or just how I see tech, but it’s true. 
 I don’t want to give up on this degree despite the doom posts and tons of data I’ve read up on, but is there any other field in which I can combine my love for technology/programming and still succeed. I do prefer the artistic side of programming (front end based projects) but I can work harder to understand the back end more. 
 What other stable options are there for technology based positions or computer science fields? I literally don’t know what else to do with my life soooo

Recently in my university course unit for data structures and algorithms I learnt how to make linked lists, so I decided to put the theory into practice (and I was also getting bored in class) by making a game that utilizes this data structure quite well: the snake game!
 The project uses the Raylib library for rendering the game. Here is the git repository: https://github.com/BrickSigma/C-Snake.
 This is my first time writing any kind of data structure in C, as my unit is taught in Java so the main challenge was dealing with the memory management. Any feedback or criticism is appreciated.

 Im developing this shoot em up and now I've started to dabble a bit further into enemy designs, more specifically: bosses.
 My idea here is:
  
create an int enemyPhase (inside my "Gun" script);
 atribute a "phase requirement" to some guns, so that they will only be active once the enemyPhase = a specific value. 
 make it so that when enemyHits = a certain value the enemyPhase value will change;

 This way I think I should be able to have more dynamic bosses, the thing is, I can't really attest to that yet since I do not know how to reference a int from another script.
 I want to be able to access the public int enemyHits contained in my script "Destructable" from my "Guns" script. Can you guys help me achieving that? 
 Any help will be more than welcome!

 I get 1.712693 (incorrect) instead of 1.699087 (correct) 
 ​
 what could possibly be causing this? I have tried using a double hoping that would increase the precision of the calculation but with no luck.

I've been observing this behavior for a year and this junior dev is a person who just loves to impose their opinions which are right 70% of the time and to be honest she is smart and brilliant but her delivery is always aggressive. In today's retrospective she basically glared her eyes and started shouting about something that bothered her then she continued to be rude randomly throughout the meeting. All the other seniors seem to go easy on her, maybe because she gets the work done but the attitude is so disrespectful. Maybe everyone is quiet so they don't lose an asset? Yes she is fast and a perfectionist but is it worth it? I might quit soon because this is not for me but I don't get the silence and how everyone are sugar coating her so she doesn't get more angry, It is like babysitting and the younger juniors who work with her, follow her lead because they obviously couldn't beat her so they joined her and It is so fake it hurts my eyes. What is going on here... Did anyone ever come across a person who is equally good and disrespectful? How to deal with such things and why is everyone quiet about it?
 I try not to ask to avoid gossip but at this point , this is so toxic I'm moving.

 Hey y’all,
 I’m a CS major who got tired of applying to 200+ internships just to get ghosted, rejected, or receiving hirevues over and over. After going through a particularly brutal experience (5 interviews + a take-home case study) and not hearing back, I decided to work on a tool that automatically tracks your applications, matches you with positions where you’re more likely to hear back and do well, and even predicts when you've been ghosted by a company (something I constantly experienced).
 https://preview.redd.it/tyo71u9a9u3d1.png?width=2846&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb24301ef065c714e28e3d97d2862d3ecf5f0a7c
 While the tool is still in development, it's helped a few people already, so I’m looking to get feedback from other CS students to make it even better. If you’re currently looking for internships (I'm currently working with a few startups looking for interns across business, design, and technology) and are interested in using the platform or providing feedback, please PM me and I’ll share the link. I really want to make finding internships easier for everyone, since I know how difficult and frustrating the application process can be, any feedback would be amazing. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure how to handle this situation. I hired a freelance artist for a small job (they're making me 30 icons for use in my game). I suspect the images they've sent me are AI generated. They're not obviously AI generated (AI hands, etc) so I can't be sure if they are, or if I'm just being paranoid. How should I handle this situation?
 Since 50 people have posted the same comment, I'll answer it here:
 Comment: If you can't tell, then why does it matter? You still have to pay them!
 Answer: Of coarse I have to pay them. I already did. I need to know whether the art is AI or not because submitting AI art can get me in trouble with certain platform holders, especially if I don't disclose it on the AI survey form which is required for game submissions. If it is AI, then I would simply hire another person to replace the images with a new batch. Not paying the original person was never remotely a consideration.

 pat-aur is a new AUR helper that aims at building packages in clean containers. Current popular aur helpers don't do that by default, my goal is rectify this by making it mandatory.
 The core features are:
  
Correctness: Build in clean containers always.
 Configurable: Configure builds by host, target and package.
 Parallelization: Build multiple packages in parallel. Parallel download of sources and dependencies.
 Cross-compilation: Build packages for other architectures. (with caveats and limitations at the moment)
  
pat-aur is not a pacman wrapper. It does not aim at replacing pacman. There are a few things to know at the moment:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m new to C++, so this may be a naive question.
 The project I’ve been working on for over one year is a very large C++ software with only one cpp file, the main.cpp. I guess there are hundreds of header files. Not really sure.
 The thing is it takes over 3 minutes to recompile, just for one small fix. I’ve seen people saying cpp/hpp implementation/interface structure is more suitable to large C++ software, so I think perhaps I should give it a try.
 But honestly I don’t know where to start. How should one approach this daunting task? I mean, it looks like in each header file, there are always over 10 header files included. So it is really hard to find a place where I can divide some piece of the header file into cpp/hpp to reduce compile time.
 And I wonder if there is some general rules for such a refactorization? 
 Sorry for my limited English. English is not my first language, but I’m trying my best to make it as clear as possible. Thank you!

 It's been a while since I've worked with C specifically. I have a couple nested structs here:
 struct Vector3
 {
 float x, y, z;
 };
 struct Tri
 {
 struct Vector3* p[3];
 };
 and this code:
 static void Tri_make(struct Vector3* p1, struct Vector3* p2, struct Vector3* p3, struct Tri* out)
 {
 struct Vector3* vs[] = { p1, p2, p3 };
 out->p = vs;
 }
 is complaining that out->p isn't a proper lvalue. From my research this tells me it's probably casting it behind the scenes. What's the proper way to reference p here?
 Thanks in advance.

 So, I was curious as to how regular expressions could be created, and I started out with chapter 5 in Software Tools in Pascal by Kernighan and Plauger. It was a good read, and I did convert the code to C before I did the exercises. Implementing a not operator for a match, was one of the exercises, as was implementing an 'all patterns must match functionality, and an any patterns must match. I cobbled these pieces together and ended up with relational operators. It is not very usable in its current form, but it was fun still.
 I'm out of time at the moment, as this was a little sideshow, and frankly I have no ambition of adding a lot of features, I plan on using it in a pipeline with ripgrep, and maybe xargs. Hopefully someone finds it interesting, and critique is welcome.

Thought about having a conversation with boss but I doubt they’ll do anything about since this person is a high performer. Should I talk to the person about keeping a good culture in the team? Or inform my boss? It happens a lot in team meetings and doesn’t go un noticed 
 Edit - thanks for the great suggestions! Will talk to them and if it continues to happen will escalate to my lead. Appreciate it!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, so this post is to both motivate people and also give a realistic explanation of how I landed my first programming job. I am a junior front end developer currently working with mainly react and have been at this job steadily for 4 months now. 
 For a bit of context before learning to code seriously, I was always interested in coding but thought I was not smart enough. I started learning multiple times in the past and gave up because I didn't believe in myself. I think this is very common, because of the stereotypes that programmers are inherently gifted or obsessed with computers - there's the mindset of if you're not obsessed you shouldn't be a developer, which is nonsense!
 At the beginning of 2023, I was miserable in my current job, wanted a challenge and a better life. So I decided…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, thank you all for the highly insightful and interesting discussions in the recent threads I created.
 This time, I want to share my favorite talk and article that I often revisit. 
 https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/
 Here's my favorite talk by Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure. I think it covers one of the most important topics in software engineering; understanding what complexity and simplicity really mean and what to do about it. He also has a great sense of humour, and this talk is much funnier to me that stand-up comedy. 
 https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/05/11/please-stop-calling-databases-cp-or-ap.html
 This is an article by the great Martin Kleppman, the author of Designing Data Intensive Applications where he basically criticizes the existing strange marketing-based treatment of the CAP theorem. This is also coverredt in the book, but in a slightly less detailed way. 
 I have more articles that I come back to occasionally, but this is the one that I immediately thought about. 
 What are your favorites and, most interestingly, why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ladies and gentlemen, I've finally done it! I've written my first program in C, something similar to the Unix "cat" utility. Before this, it was just a couple of simple algorithms in college, years ago. Now the program is only 50 lines long, but it introduced me to so many new concepts: pointers, error handling, streams, and standards. Jesus, standard C doesn't know about directories! Maybe I will be ashamed of this post later, but right now, I'm really proud of myself. I plan to implement more Unix utilities in the future.
 For some reason, I decided to learn C programming as my latest hobby. It can be difficult to find time in my routine, but I managed to complete "Modern C" by Jens Gustedt, skipping all the exercises, though. I didn't want to make the reading take forever. I wanted to experience programming at its best.
 Review my code, please:
 /* Get file name through argument and print its content to stdout. If multiple arguments provided, multiple files concatenated. */ #include <stdlib.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <errno.h> #include <string.h> #include <sys/stat.h> int print_file(char fname[]) { FILE *fp = fopen(fname, "r"); if (!fp) { perror(fname); return errno; } enum {BUF_SIZE = 1024}; char buffer[BUF_SIZE]; size_t read = 0; int err = 0; while (!feof(fp)) { read = fread(buffer, sizeof(char), BUF_SIZE, fp); for (size_t i = 0; i < read; ++i) { err = fputc(buffer[i], stdout); if (err) { continue; } } } if (ferror(fp)) { perror(fname); } if (fclose(fp)) { perror(fname); } return 0; } int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { if (argc < 2) { return 0; } int err; struct stat fstat = {0}; for (int i = 1; i < argc; ++i) { char *fname = argv[i]; stat(fname, &fstat); if (!S_ISREG(fstat.st_mode)) { fprintf(stderr, "Not a file: %s\n", fname); continue; } err = print_file(fname); if (err) { return err; } } return EXIT_SUCCESS; }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm asking this question because I don't find data structure and algorithm fundamental for computer science. The algorithm complexity is indeed important, but algorithms such as Selection Sort or Insertion Sort doesn't seem "fundamental" because you are going to use a function called "sort" for sorting a collection in any programming language.
 The computational thinking is very important, but I can't see any correlation between studying selection sort and computational thinking. Does anyone think differently?

I wanted to know if there are any projects that I could make that would test these skills so that I have more firm grasp. I know doing is the best way of learning which is why I'd rather find a good project that tests these skills instead of just studying them on youtube. Let me know if there are any projects that are great for testing these concept. This isn't really for my portfolio so it doesn't have to be super complex and impressive.

 At the moment i've created a dummy user and locked it. but ... its not so nice, i think.

The main thing I'd like to use it for is to upload projects so that I could put a link to projects on a resume. From what I understand, you code on your local computer and can upload it to Github. This seems simple enough but I cannot find the specifics of how to do this. I think I figured out how to get a project from Visual Studio to Github, but I'm confused on how to move other things onto Github. For example, if I coded an HTML webpage on Notepad++ and have that HTML file stored on my local machine, is there a way to upload that to Github? How could I move a whole folder of code files for a project to Github? Sorry if this is a stupid question but I have no idea what I'm doing with Github. Thanks for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to create a function zip that receives a variadic amount of Containers and then unpacks them and puts them in a Containers of vectors where each vector receives a column of the Containers.
 The example of my homework is a the next:
 std::list<int> v1 = { 11, 12, 13 }; std::list<int> v2 = { 21, 22, 23 }; std::list<int> v3 = { 31, 32, 33 }; auto result = zip(v1, v2, v3); // result would be: list<vector<int>> for (const auto& row : result) { for (const auto& value : row) std::cout << value << " "; std::cout << std::endl; } \ // output would be: //11 21 31 //12 22 32 //13 23 33 } 
 I have made some code but not much:
 template <typename... Containers> auto zip(const Containers&... containers) { using ValueType = typename std::common_type_t<typename Containers::value_type...>; std::list<std::vector<ValueType>> result; return result; } 
 Could someone point me to the right direction? I could add that variadic templates in general confuse me a little bit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What’s up with this sub? I popped on here because as a professional game dev I’d love to help newbie programmer but the vast majority of questions submitted are just “what language” or “I like games but hate programming how do I become a programmer”. And I’m only slightly exaggerating with those quotes. Many posts are a sentence are two long.
 That’s fine though, downvote and move on. What gets me is the fact that some of them have positive upvotes and all of them have people responding in paragraphs and paragraphs of usually good advice.
 Why? Why on earth are people here responding to the laziest posts with three well-formatted paragraphs. Let’s be honest, most of the posters being responded to are literally not motivated enough to read the responses they get.
 All this does is encourage a ton of absolute garbage tier posting because that’s what it takes to get a response. I can’t help but think that the entire sub could do a way better job of investing in motivated, high-quality posts.

I just got ahold of the code base I’ll be working on (haven’t gotten to start it yet or even know what I’ll be doing yet; waiting on permissions) and I can’t help but think I’m in over my head. The code is so complex and far from anything I’ve done and it uses so many libraries I completely lack familiarity with. And then the fact that a large amount of it was developed by another intern YOUNGER than me just doesn’t sit right with my confidence. I’m scared I won’t be able to do anything worthwhile and look bad.

 Luckily one of them speaks fluently, but the other one doesn’t and feels a bit isolated since the team will only speak English when talking to them. 
 First of all, I’m Chinese American so this is not stemming from racism, but the idea that I will need to speak Mandarin to fit in more is a little bit off-putting. 
 This is in Menlo Park as well as Bellevue. Are the other locations also like this? Are most SWE teams at Meta like this? My friends interning at Microsoft and Amazon in the Bellevue area do not experience the same.

 I'm writing a linear algebra library (and lattice library) in rust, and I've been getting a bit sick of how many "where" clauses I need to add to guarantee that yes, the array that holds the entries of the matrix is indeed "Sized." Shouldn't this be inferred? It's also additionally silly that I need to separately specify `where [() ; M * N]: Sized` and `where [() ; N * M]: Sized', since they're literally the same thing.
 Anyone know if there's a way to avoid having to write all these?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to share a situation I'm in and get your opinions on it.
 Recently, I had a technical interview that went quite well, and I've been offered a position. However, instead of using Spring Boot, the company uses Java Vert.x. I've been researching Vert.x and set up a demo project to get familiar with the technology. It seems interesting, especially depending on the complementary libraries they use, like ORM Hibernate Reactive, among others.
 My main concern is about switching from Spring, a highly demanded framework with great prospects, to Vert.x. I feel it's a step out of my "comfort zone," not so much technically, but in terms of stability and the future of the technology. With the threat of Loom, Virtual Threads, and other developments, I'm worried whether the ecosystem of libraries around Vert.x is modern and follows industry standards, or if it's more oriented towards "legacy" solutions.
 I've been with my current company for about six months, and while I'm not completely happy with the team and tools, the conditions and environment are not ideal. The new offer has a significant salary increase and other social benefits that are very appealing, but Vert.x is the only point where I have doubts.
 Do you think it's worth leaving Spring Boot, even temporarily, and betting on reactive programming with Vert.x? Has anyone here made a similar switch and could share their experience? Should I consider this "leap of faith" or keep looking for opportunities that align more with my experience in Spring Boot?
 I appreciate any advice or experiences you can share.
 PD: I'm 24 years old, so I'm young. 2-3 years experience.

 Is printing system configs in the terminal really such a big deal that it warrants this many implementations / forks etc? And if so, what am I missing out on? Are there other novelty terminal applications I should know about too?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi clever people. I have a somewhat tricky bit-shifting question.
 Let's say I have four bytes in contiguous memory and I want to put their most significant bits together into a nibble.
 I could do:
 uint8 nibble = ((ptr[0]4)&8) | ((ptr[1]5)&4) | ((ptr[2]6)&2) | ((ptr[3]7)&1);
 Where 'ptr' is a uint8 pointer.
 I'm wondering if there is a simpler way by casting to a uint32 first and then doing some division or shifting?
 Is there any optimisation that can be done here? Does my question even make sense?
 Edit: Thanks to everyone who replied. Unfortunately I have no useful intrinsics to exploit and I'm restricted to 32 bits for this problem. I thought it might be a simple case of bit shifting (down), but I guess I will have to make do with what I've got. Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Statement expressons allow statements to be used in place of expressions. The statement evaluates to the final expression.
 As a contrived example you could do:
 // a will evaluate to b's final value (10) int a = ({ int b = 0; while(b < 10) { b++; } b; }); printf("a is: %d\n", a); 
 GCC offers this as an extension but it's not part of the standard. Is there a reason why it was never standardised?
 The ternary operator enables branching while evaluating to an expression but it quickly becomes ugly if chained.
 Is there some technical reason for statement expressions never becoming standardised were they just not viewed as valuable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After installing Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, naturally I tried to install Steam with apt, to no avail. I decided to just install through the App Center. After that every Steam game not using OpenGL failed to open, but after opening Steam through terminal I realised it's because 'Steam could not initalize Vulkan' (or something to that effect). After a few hours of troubleshooting, thinking it was my drivers, or the Vulkan installation and considering just reinstalling the OS, I seen a post where someone said to reinstall Steam. After manually adding the repository and reinstalling it, lo and behold everything worked absolutely fine. I believe it's because installing it through apt, it installs 32-bit drivers that you don't get with the App Center version. This is a very dumbed down version of events, I was troubleshooting for a while.
 Perhaps it's my fault, I'm not sure. But, to my knowledge, I did what any typical user would do. Install OS - Update OS - Install drivers - Install Steam (through apt), which failed, so I chose to install through the App Center. So, I'm going to put fault on Ubuntu for this one. I have no idea why it wasn't in the apt repo in the first place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys.\ I love my setup, but there's one thing that bothers me. Quite often I just want to start my PC, log into the terminal, execute like one or two commands and shutdown again. That's why I have my system configured to boot into tty. However, I also want to use my normal UI with i3, firefox, you name it…
 When I want that, I boot into tty, log in, and type "startx". WOW! Everything works fine like this, but I'm curious whether I could add a boot-option to grub that boots into something like sddm, while still keeping an option to boot into tty.
 I use systemd, grub and honestly I'm fine with any display manager.
 From my limited knowledge I'd just need the boot-process to graphical.target. Is this correct? How do I accomplish this? Somehow set it differently or simply execute systemctl start graphical.target at the end automatically?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To keep a long story short, my team is in charge of several microservices which are incredibly bounded together, hard to debug, need to deploy together, etc. etc.
 Ideally I would like to consolidate the majority of them into one service - I've talked with my team leader and my skip and they both agree with me that that's probably for the best...at some point. It's not a priority - and hence the reason for this post: I can't find a good enough reason other than dev experience and velocity.
 The system works well enough, processing millions of payments a day. It has faults and bugs, but it works - and adding new features is relatively simple (as long as it's similar to something already in the system). Reworking the microservices into one service sounds like a lot of work for...honestly, not enough value now that I'm writing this.
 What were the reasons that you consolidated your microservices? was it worth it? any major pitfalls, or things that you regret?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce the release of Diesel 2.2. Diesel is a safe and performant query builder and ORM written in Rust. You can checkout the full release announcement here. This release contains several new features and improves existing features. Diesel now provides a procedural macro attribute that infers the correct return type for your query. It's now possible to instrument connection implementations provided by diesel to perform logging and performance measurements. We added support for PostgreSQL's COPY FROM and COPY TO syntax which can be used to send and receive large amounts of data efficiently. Our dependencies wrapping the native database drivers support now all building the database driver as part of your cargo build. This enables us to distribute static precompiled versions of diesel-cli easily. Finally we worked with the Rust team to stabilize attributes to customize error messages emitted by the compiler. This is now used by diesel to improve the quality of certain otherwise hard to understand error messages. 
 This release wouldn't be possible without the support of our contributors and sponsors. If you want to support diesels development, consider joining the reviewer team, submitting PR's, help writing documentation or sponsor the maintainers.
 I'm happy to answer any questions about this release or diesel in general.

I'm wanting to unlock it so I could disable secure boot and boot anything that isn't just Windows or some Linux distro already signed with MS keys to allow for secure booting. I already know how to dump the BIOS chip (or the EC chip, rather) since I believe the password (or a hash of one) resides there. I already have a dump but I can't really write back since my SOIC8 clip is wearing off and doesn't want to stay attached at all anymore; I could hold it in place except that I have to be very steady with it (hard when it actively tries to pops off lmao) and will basically become unrecognized after around 10-15 seconds.

 it is in data analytics rather than software development but i mean im not the best at coding and i never got along with any of my fellow comp sci majors in undergrad anyways so i will happily take it. no it is not at a fortune 500 company, no i am not making six figures, but i will be making 70K which is more than enough to survive off of and im building up the resume
 moral of the story: go to career fairs and even if no opportunities come from it immediately connect with the recruiters. i got this job because i had a really good conversation with two of the recruiters at the company. 
 i had my first interview with the company on a tuesday and got my offer that friday. i had to mute this sub because of how negative it was and it made me extremely stressed to enter the job market but it gets better!! its not as scary as it sounds. 
 ngl im drunk right now because im celebrating my accomplishments but yes, i fucking did it. i have an interview tomorrow for a different job actually in software development that im going to just to see but im probably going to stick with my silly little numbers job 
 now to debate if i want to go grad school eventually

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About 3 months ago, I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1b5yk9r/kde_plasma_6_how_many_of_you_are_thinking_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
 Now, I can fully say that I've definitely switched from GNOME to KDE Plasma. Mind you, that I'm using NixOS Stable channel, so I only get Plasma 5.27, but even I'm well satisfied. I used GNOME for about 3 years, before switching to KDE Plasma.
 People say KDE Plasma is too much like Windows, it's too much customization, or it's too buggy. I can argue that GNOME isn't enough. It's great for simple users who don't want to customize anything, but over time, it became annoying that the DE had limits, which you could only modify if you added extensions.
 The only bugs I've seen are graphical glitches that causes some stuttering. But it's not really a deal breaker.
 Graphically, KDE Plasma is very impressive. There's a charming affect whenever this DE interacts with you. There's especially a lot "fading" effects, like pressing meta key, dragging different open windows, or opening things on the taskbar. But their selection of desktop backgrounds, even their "start button," and even starting it up where it shows the Plasma icon; it's all so charming. Even their notification sounds are very distinguishable.
 Whereas in GNOME, you get some irrelevant sounds like "dog bark" or "glass" or "pop" sound. None of these sounds have style, nor are they memorable.
 It feels really nice when DEs not only make something nice and snappy, but also put some thought and effort into the branding. In GNOME, all you see is the "activities" corner, and that doesn't really help, and I can hardly remember the "foot print" logo.
 I do have to say, GNOME has made some very useful software that's hard to pass on: GNOME Disks and Disk Usage Analyzer to say the least. I still use some of the default GNOME programs in my systems.
 But overall, KDE Plasma is very impressive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From what I understand, it's healthy practice to implement IDisposable on objects which manage the lifetime of IDisposable resources. But I'm finding that I'm implementing the interface far too much.
 To provide an example, consider this simple application structure:
 class Program {} class Server {} class Service {} class DataProvider {} class DatabaseConnection {} 
 Here, the program creates a server which manages a service that uses DataProvider to interact with a database.
 If the DatabaseConnection is disposable and managed by the DataProvider , then shouldn't DataProvider also be disposable? And if the DataProvider is disposable and managed by Service... then shouldn't Service also be disposable? And if the Service is disposable and managed by Server...
 Where does the cycle stop? When do we avoid implementing the IDisposable interface on objects that manage disposable resources?
 Consider this implementation for Service:
 class Service { void Start(); void Stop(); } 
 if the Service lifetime is managed with the Start() and Stop() methods, can we dispose resources in Stop()? Or is it still preferred to implement IDisposable here and invoke Dispose(true) in the Stop method?

 I was wondering, what kind of abstraction does such a complex software use for its UI? I do know that it is mostly a Swing application, I’m more interested in how its components map to, MVC if they are using that, and whether it’s event driven, how that is managed, etc. So a technical, but still somewhat high level overview of its UI design.
 I’m sure I could find it by browsing through the community edition’s code base, but I could use some handholding before I jump into it. Also, might be an interesting discussion for others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all - 
 Started as a Junior 3 years ago, getting ready to switch companies for the first time, and wanted to ask the community's opinion.
 The company I'm leaving has recently (within the past year or so) hired two very senior DevOps Engineers. Both have 10+ YOE. One was hired at a managerial level, one as a Senior (though not staff) Engineer.
 Both have, frankly, struggled. I'm not a typical Junior (had 20+ years of experience in management outside of Tech before moving into an IC role), so even though I've still got a lot to learn about IT, the director and VP have come to me about people management issues, and I keep suggesting caution and patience.
 Every DevOps Engineer that I've seen start with us, it takes about 6 months to get to a level of proficiency where you can start producing individually across the organization. I think that Seniors (and Managers) get a lot shorter of a leash when it comes to this kind of thing - they have higher expectations to 'hit the ground running.' But my experience is that they do not 'ramp' any quicker, and may in fact ramp up more slowly.
 I don't think this is an ageist thing on my part (again: am old), and our most productive DevOps by FAR is a guy who is a 'Super Senior' - he's staff level, has been here for 10+ years, and is a master. But again - he's been here for ten years.
 I was reading a book where a physicist decries that he's 'too old' at 30 to make any major discoveries, and the paradigm of an athlete (where you're cooked after 10-15 years professionally) fit a little too well onto the DevOps Engineers I know.
 TL;DR - Do DevOps's have an expiration date? Is it harder to join a new team when you're more experienced? Or am I just seeing outliers and trying to draw a trend line that doesn't exist?

So this might sound like a good and creative thing but it's actually not, because sometimes when writing code I stop at a situation where I can't write good and clear variables names, other people would just name them something understandable at least and then continue but when I try to do so I start getting anxiety. As if I am having obsessive compulsive disorder over my code to keep it clean.
 Edit: Some people thought that I am trying to code "clean" but not "simple" code, by talking about this situation it's happening to me for both things. Always trying to make it simple and clean as possible.

In a nutshell I write code to build and deploy an application and that is always customised for this application. For sure there are many scripts that I can reuse for several applications but it still requires a lot of internal application knowledge like does it require PVCs, environment variables, ports, or even a context directory to build a new image.
 In this sub I frequently read that one small devops team sometimes supports dozens of teams and I can’t understand how it works. 
 Can someone explain please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m designing a multi form project so things get kind of crazy if you lose track of things… 
 One thing in particular that annoys me is double clicking by accident and then going into the behind the scenes code, trying to delete it because I didn’t want it, but then it breaks everything down. 
 I know they say don’t edit the code but rather, edit the properties in designer. 
 Two things in particular that are making me lose my sanity: 
  
My data grid view doesn’t seem to want to display my auto incrementing ID. I seeded it to “1” and made the step 1, but sometimes it’ll work, sometimes it’ll just be a blank column with a load of null values which I can’t comprehend because the other columns work just fine. 
 
Naming… my designer window won’t even work sometimes because it says this.Name = “xyz” — string can’t be converted to System.yadayada. 
 
 I’ve fixed these problems by pressing ctrl Z as I assume some small property somehow got changed and screwed the display, but I feel like I’m always on the edge. 
 Any tips or thoughts?

 Then, I shut the laptop down, removed the charger and held the power button for 12s. After that, I was presented with a “No bootable drives” screen. 
 I managed to get on the UEFI menu, and my NVMe shows up there, as well as my HDD. Both of them do not show up on the BOOT submenu. 
 I managed to get into Grub, but when i launch arch linux, i get thrown into emergency shell with Error: device UUID not found, skippping fsck.
 I can’t manage to make the NVMe appear. I have a usb with arch live image and booted it. lsblk doesnt show my nvme either. what can i do?
 FIX: changed sata mode to AHCI. On my UEFI settings, it was hidden, I had to press CTRL+S on advanced submenu. laptop model: acer nitro 5

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is NOT a question about the ‘wars’ (is language X ‘better’ than language Y). 
 Obviously we have seen the emergence of new and improved (arguably) systems programming languages such as Rust, Zig, Nim, Go and more (and they take different approaches). 
 Now, there seems to be the view that languages like Rust are in a variety of important ways and for a variety of purposes, ‘the way forward’, since they, for example, bake in memory safety and type safety, cf C and CPP. 
 However, cpp has been evolving for 3 decades and is now up to cpp. 
 So, my question is whether releases like C++23 have enough features in them that they allow highly experienced C++23 programmers to write safe code without necessarily having to use rust, for example?
 Again, this is not about judging whether cpp will have to yield to rust. What I’m asking is whether cpp has evolved enough, and whether it might continue to evolve enough, that it could be used as an alternative to languages like rust which come with a lot of safety features at the outset? 
 Or is it a bit like a car? Modern cars have airbags and seatbelts and so on. With a very old car you can retrofit seatbelts and airbags and such but it might always be a little bit ‘hack’, since it hasn’t necessarily been engineered into the design from the bottom up?

 So I made a small genetic algorithems engine. The basic premise is u implement some basic functions for ur creature type and then my engine runs the process for you. 
 I first made it single threaded then I added mpi. Now I did not do a full ub test on the mpi build but at first glance it seems to work.
 I tested it on the busy beaver game. Ofc I am not going to get anywhere near anything interesting there but I thought its a cool problem and I wana throw my hat in the ring. 
 The basic premise was that evaluation of a specific Turing machine can block the entire pool. So I split it into many pools and they each send their best candidates to a manager that would decide if its worth broadcasting. 
 With just 4 processes I got results which were WAY better than the single threaded version. Kinda happy about it

 ... and unfortunately, I've not been able to find a log or anything that elaborates further on that. My solution has a ton of projects (20+ 40+, absolutely monolithic) so I'm down to scanning the packages.json for dupe entries. I did try what was replied here  and here  as well but no luck. Figured I'd ask if anyone as had this happen to them and if there is anything else I maybe hadn't tried yet.
 Thanks a ton for the time!
 edit: missed spaces after the "here" links and correction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SwiftWave is a self-hosted, lightweight PaaS solution for easily deploying and managing your applications on any server 🚀. It's an open-source alternative to Heroku, Netlify, and Render.
 You could checkout the website for installation guide.
 🚀 Website: https://swiftwave.org/
 🌟 Show some love by starring the repo: https://github.com/swiftwave-org/swiftwave
  
Swiftwave and all of its components (like udpproxy, volume-tooklit, resource usage collector, micro dns) are written in Golang. After writing all the things for more than 1 year, I must say Golang is a language which has a sweet point. One side, it has great performance , another side it has good development experience.
 Swiftwave daemon takes only ~50MB ram in idle case and 1~2% of single vCPU. That's amazing for a PaaS. Swiftwave have it's integrated task queue, cronjob handler, all are lightweight due to implementation with goroutine.
 Check out this link, which contains links to the source code for every Swiftwave component written in golang.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I mean it. It's literally one of the scariest products.
 For many reasons too! Like:
  
Takes more time to complete one product than 99% of any products that exist (of course I don't mean construction or infrastructure or whatever, I mean stuff that an entrepreneur or small company can produce)
 What consumers want is hard to predict. It's very hard to predict what game is good and will sell before investing a considerable amount of time into it.
 Because of 1 and 2 it means that each product is a huge risk too. Investing years of your life into something that may very likely flop.
  
It's kinda crazy that indie games exist at all. These things take literal years to develop, there's no product out there more time-consuming. I mean at least if you build a house over a few years, someone will buy that damn house. No such guarantee with games. It's crazy, literally the scariest thing to do as a career.

 I've been working on a project for the past few weeks to learn game engine design and to learn lower level graphics with Vulkan.
 This is the second time this has happened to me where seemingly out of nowhere one of my static libraries suddenly can't find any headers from another static library..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on trying to create an endpoint in an MVC Controller. The basic version looks like this:
 [HttpPost] public ActionResult AddStandards(AddStandardsRequest body) { Dictionary<string, dynamic> result = new Dictionary<string, dynamic>(); result["documentId"] = body.documentId; if(body.userfile.ContentLength > 0) { var wb = new XLWorkbook(body.userfile.InputStream); } var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(result); return Content(json, "application/json"); } 
 body.userfile is a binary .xlsx file that I know works because previously I was using a different Excel library and could read the stream fine. I assume the underlying error is that I'm opening the workbook wrong or something.
 However, it seems like whenever an exception is thrown while doing anything with HttpPostedFileBase.InputStream, the debugger doesn't trigger any breakpoints/catch any exceptions and the endpoint returns a 500 error:
 [NotSupportedException: Collection is read-only.] 
 I assume what's happening is it's trying to output something exception-related and so tries to write to the input stream and everything goes to hell. So how can I modify this so that I can see the true exception that's happening? I've tried searching for this but all of the results are simply about people explicitly attempting to write to the input stream, which I'm not, I'd just like a clear exception message.
 I'd appreciate any help anyone can give.

Every time I add a control to my form in the designer, it is not recognized by IntelliSense until I completely restart Visual Studio. I receive the error "control does not exist in the current context". This is regardless of the control type or the form. The same thing happens with UserControls. If it makes any difference, the solution was originally a winforms solution that now also has wpf projects in it.
 I have tried building, rebuilding, and cleaning both the project and solution, which does not address the issue. The only solution that fixes it is to restart visual studio completely. Current versioning: C# |.NET Framework 4.8 | Visual Studio Professional 2022 17.9.5

 Out of curiosity, I decided to learn some Clojure and finally try to get what is so cool about functional programming. 
 It's highly unlikely Clojure or FP in general will be useful for my career, but I like it so far. It's so drastically different from Go, Python, JavaScript thatv I have experience with. 
 Currently, I am reading Clojure for the Brave and True, and it seems like a great resource. 
 Anyway, I don't want to bias this discussion towards functional programming (but I suspect it might be a popular answer). 
 What is something out of your professional stack that you learned recreationally and that helped you level up as an engineer?

 I feel like I finally got "know" how tasks truly work and how they should be used, how I should be mindful of it when desgining next time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone noticed the recent trend in software applications toward just doing more stuff?
 It seems that in the last 2-3 years lots of software applications are adding adjacent features to the point of becoming bloated, but some people seem to love this. 
 “I can do everything all in one place”
 Is this part of some larger cycle where software will grow in features to the point of being bloated and a more focussed competitor will take a share of the market back?
 Has anyone else noticed this trend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a child form that allows the user to input a row into a table. Correct me if I'm wrong but it seemed like the best way was to make it a dialog box. I mapped the submit button to OK and cancel button to Abort in properties so I could test for the click in the main form, then send data using properties.
 I get dialog boxes are a type of window to gather or display information via user, so in my code I did ChildForm.ShowDialog()
 I assumed it was necessary to, well, show the dialog box? I am confused now what is needed for this child form, as I commented out 3 lines tutorials/docs online said are necessary... and NOW my code is working right but I don't get why.
 The problem is that now, when I click Submit/Cancel, the child form closes but then quickly opens as if I am instantiating a new child form immediately, and only stays closed after a second hit of Submit/Cancel.
 See:
 AddPart addPart = new AddPart(this);
 //this.Controls.Add(addPart);
 //addPart.BringToFront();
 //addPart.ShowDialog();
 Why do I not need any of the commented out code? I am thoroughly confused when to and not use these sorts of methods when controlling a child form.
 Edit for u/Slypenslyde:
 private void Add1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
 {
 AddPart addPart = new AddPart();
 //this.Controls.Add(addPart);
 //addPart.BringToFront();
 //addPart.ShowDialog();
 if (addPart.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
 {
 Console.WriteLine( "Test");
 addPart.Visible = false;
 addPart.Close();
 addPart.Dispose();
 } 
 else
 {
 addPart.Close();
 addPart.Visible = false;
 addPart.Dispose();
 }
 }
 This is literally it! Everything else is boiler plate code, data validation, and auto generated code from Designer....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to keep your idea to yourself it's fine, but anyone who wants to share is welcome.
 Here's my idea:
 Taking what's addictive and fun about a game with predatory monetization and stripping out any predatory element. Like a gacha game but singleplayer and with no microtransactions at all.
 What I mean by that is that predatory games are very fun. There's something about them, the way they reward you and hook you, that makes people want to spend so much money.
 Well imagine a game where you CAN'T spend anything, but it's still designed to be as addictive and fun. A simple one-time, offline singleplayer purchase but with the fun of one of those games.
 Why would anyone make this? Well, a big company won't, it would want to squeeze every dime. But an indie dev might want to make it for the one time fee of $15 or whatever. Many indie devs would be happy with that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m trying to design a side project with core functionalities similar to a TUI version of Fog of World. Essentially, I want to display a coarse-grained world map in the terminal that can:
 • Zoom in to a certain extent (enough to, say, display some cities within a state in the USA)
 • Support tracking routes (highlighting a path)
 • Support expansion (adding new cities and roads)
 Visually, the effect I’m aiming for is similar to this "overview map" of Fog of World.
 Since my user interface needs are relatively simple (a map, and perhaps a sidebar or a floating panel), I guess using C and ncurses might be sufficient. The key challenges might be:
 • How to obtain real-world map data
 • How to modify, expand, and customize the map data
 An ASCII renderer like MapSCII can achieve great effects, but it might be overkill for my project. I’m also not sure about the customizability of its map data from OpenStreetMap.
 I would love to hear your thoughts.

 I'm excited to share Rill, a library for simplified concurrent programming in Go.
 https://github.com/destel/rill
 Its main goals are to reduce boilerplate code, simplify error handling, and provide a lightweight solution for complex concurrency tasks. It can be thought of as a functional programming approach to handling Go channels, offering fine-grained control over concurrency.

Streaming: Rill is designed for stream based workflows, though it can be used to work with slices as well
 Error handling: Dealing with errors can be non-trivial in concurrent applications. Rill makes it easy to propagate errors through the pipeline and handle them at the end, centralizing error management

 std::next(rng.cbegin(), n) is used to initialize both the end of the deque and the iterator in the loop. Somehow, the loop's iterator is always one after the deque's end, preventing the last window from being yielded. Anyone got any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a task where I need to run an ETL against 44 different databases. I don't care about which of them finishes first so what I'm wanting to do is just launch the request against all the databases in Paralell.
 await Parallel.ForEachAsync(req.Counties, async (county, ct) => { var database = _ServiceProvider.GetService<DatabaseContext>(); using var etl = new ETL(database, _logger); foreach (var countyCode in counties) { RunUpdates(); _logger.LogInformation($"Starting for {countyCode} at {DateTime.Now:dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm:ss}"); await etl.RunEtl(countyCode); await etl.UpdateStuffFromETL(countyCode); _logger.LogInformation($"Completed update for {countyCode} at {DateTime.Now:dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm:ss}"); } }); 
 This code works fine, but it resides inside an API which is called by a scheduled task. This API also services our web app as well. The box should have around 8 cores. My question is should I pass any any options for configuring this. I've never worked with Parallel before. From my research it's recommended not to unless you have a reason but the API will need to run this as well as whatever request come from the application.
 It may be that it makes sense to have this running on a separate VM instance. That's kind of where my mind goes but that's not the current planned architechture although it might be something I can suggest if it's needed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I’m fairly new (<6 months) to learning C++, and lately I’ve been interested in test driven development, using Catch2. Catch2 works great, very simple to work with in any .cpp file. Problem is, v2 is a single header, so compilation times are obscene. (I’ve been having trouble installing or utilizing v3 and ended up giving up on the transition; I’m on Linux so this might be an issue of v2 still being around and used silently.)
 I had learned about object files a while back, but mostly just tucked them away into the mental box of “things that exist but I don’t understand when I would need them”. Now, I found a case where I need them!
 From now on, with Catch2 v2, I’m writing unit test files that #include headers with my function declarations, but I compile them to object files without linking. Thus, I’m able to go through the long compile time once per unit test .cpp file (barring future additions to such a file), and then iterate on the function definitions until the test passes, without needing to go through the long compile time whenever I update the function!
 I realize this is a fairly basic thing in anyone’s C++ journey, but it was magical for me in understanding the “why” behind some compiler features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am a university student, currently dual booting Linux and Windows on my laptop, at least while I transition from windows. One of the largest troubles I had at the start of using Linux was the lack of the Office 365 suite. I know the LibreOffice exists, but most things at university are shared as .pdf, .ppxt, or word, and not being able to quickly and accurately read and edit these documents is simply not okay. 
 ​
 It feels like Microsoft is helping the transition to Linux by making the web version of these apps so good. Soon there will be no difference between the web app and desktop app in windows. In which case, Microsoft will have solved my largest sore spot when switching to Linux. I find this very funny, I don't know why they did this, I suppose because they see collaborative work taking off. I was curious to hear what you guys think, and if you use these apps as well, or do you live with the Libre suite?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context: I'm making a savefile system using System.Text.Json. Basic logic works like this: each savable item returns its own specific type of SaveState object, which is then serialized into Json. So Foo returns FooSaveState and Bar returns BarSaveState.
 It all worked pretty nicely until I reached the point where I need to save a state machine that is set up like this: there's an abstract Behavior class from which each specific state derives. The program has a List<Behavior> myBehaviors and during each update loop it calls myBehaviors[activeBehavior].Execute(). Each derived Behavior has its own set of internal data that I can't generalize out in a global BehaviorSaveState class because otherwise it would be a huge mess and a bit of a waste of space.
 Since I figured I'd save only the active state, I thought I'd solve the issue by writing in Behavior an abstract Save() method that returns a generic System.Object, then each derived behaviors overrides it with its own, specific SaveState class.
 Saving works well and the data written in the file is correct, but loading breaks, because I discovered that the deserialization, rather than a System.Object object, gives me a JsonElement object which I can't seem to be able to deserialize further, nor cast into the correct SaveState class.
 Help, please? Any suggestion? How would you approach it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have 1 year of experience and been on the lookout for a switch lately. Most postings I come across require having prior experience on their particular tech stack. It does not seem to matter that the work I have been doing is exactly what the job needs, just that I use a different language and framework to achieve the same thing. Honestly, I could bridge the gap within the first month when no one expects anything of me anyway. Funny thing is, I have actually gotten an interview for a role that is a bit different from my current one but since I have experience in the language they use, I was shortlisted lol. This is a shift from what I have heard from my seniors, they said that nature of work, dsa proficiency/problem solving skills and even college mattered more than the tech stack.
 Have you all also faced the same or is it just me? Any reason why this could be happening? Maybe because companies feel like they will waste time and effort in training the employee in a new language? Anyway, I would like to hear from you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to count the number of bytes in between a pipeline like this:
 cat BIG-FILE | ./my-program | some-other-program 
 Contents of my-program.go:
 func main() { var count int64 var total int64 var err error for { count, err = io.CopyN(os.Stdout, os.Stdin, 1048576) if err != nil { total += count goto DONE } total += count } DONE: _, _ = fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "%d bytes copied.\n", total) } 
  
Eventually, the completed program will do more work for every few hundred megabytes of data that has been consumed, such as a notification to either STDERR and/or AWS SQS. This part is not coded yet.
  
Is using io.CopyN the best approach?
 I'm OK with a simple err != nil check and not actually checking the value of err. Letting the program fail is OK in this scenario. However, if there is a way to have better error checking, without having a performance impact, then I would like to know how to do this.
 If so, what would be the best value for n in the third argument to io.CopyN? Right now, I have this hard-coded to 1048576.
 If not, what is a better approach?
  
BIG-FILE will typically be measured in gigabytes. Also, it may not be a file at all, but just a program that outputs its results to STDOUT, such as gzip -d -c.
  
gist to complete program, including all imports.
 Thank you.
 EDIT: I really appreciate all of your replies. These are some great questions for me to consider and suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I heard a lot of people saying that Reactive Framework like Netty, RxJava is dying because of java 21 provides this feature out of the box using Virtual Thread. As I do some research about it so far, they added one more layer which is Virtual Thread and instead of blocking at the Platform Thread layer, which is consider to be expensive in order to create or perform context switching, now we block at the Virtual Thread layer which is way more cheaper and consume less memory using continuation and yield similar to couroutine in Kotlin. I agree that this approach would provide better performance. However, it doesn't provide some kind of non-blocking or asynchronous feature out of the box at all it still keep blocking but just at the difference layer.
 PS, my intention was just asking for knowledge I might miss understand something. I'm not flexing or being egoist please understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have been working for the past few weeks on a project using Java Spring. Man, it was tiring. 
 Why are so many frameworks such as Spring Security or Spring Web updated so regularly? It has come to a point where functions used at the start of this year has been deprecated when it is used now. 
 It is so hard to keep up, especially when the docs are not that clear and the guides online are outdated. Why fix things when they are not broken? 
 I understand that updated the frameworks perhaps make the them more robust, but at least provide extensive support for how to keep up instead of updating it so frequently?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I should mention that I have no commercial game to my name; I've only ever made prototypes and short free games. I applied to this position because it said that they would consider applicants with less experience for adjusted salary. The recruiter said that they "had carefully examined my resume". Somehow they came to the conclusion that I would be fine to "lead many projects full-time" (among other options such as 3d or pixel artist). When I asked them what they meant by "leading many projects full-time", they answered "leading more than one project".
 I'm so confused. What am I supposed to do? Kind of feel like I'm speaking to a ChatGPT approximation of a gamedev recruiter.
 Edit: So, many comments with the same idea that it's a scam. I wasn't sure at the start how it might be, but now it's blindingly obvious. I just haven't come across any gamedev scams, they're usually more common denominator jobs. It might be interesting to confirm or see what they've come up with, but I've decided not communicate with them any more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking for a minimal client or script for YouTube feed, but didn't find anything that could satisfy my needs for speed (yt-dlp is slow to fetch information for a video let alone multiple ones) and simplicity (no GUI), so I eventually decided to try and do it myself.
 After searching, testing and failing multiple times I made this bash script which did the job for me. I wanted to share it here in case someone needs it.
 I'd like to emphasis that it does the job. I am no bash expert by any means and I'm sure you'll find mistakes in the script from your experience.
 Features:
  
Import from / Export to NewPipe.
 
Fast feed fetch (I have 39 subs and it takes just about 1.5 seconds to update).
 
Thumbnails, Channel Name and Video Title.
 
Subscribe by just copying channel URL and invoking the script.
 
 Sadly, I cannot get video duration as YouTube doesn't add it into RSS feed
 Here's the link to the script in my dotfiles (if you are interested) which are still work in progress.
 P.S: Make sure to get the dependencies for the script
  
It depends on .scripts/extra/cmdfns for notifications (I use dunst) and mpv function running mpv with some options (you can just omit the options altogether and use your own mpv config file).
 I made a rule to make Konsole floating in RiverWM (Yes, this is river): rule at the bottom of .config/river/init and the floating window script is .scripts/extra/terman
 The script also depends on .scripts/extra/fzfpreview for image preview
 You'll need fzf (of course), curl, perl, xargs, sed and awk (unless you change the fundamental parsing of the script) and mpv + yt-dlp to run the video and chafa and bat for preview.
 Install jq for importing from / exporting to NewPipe.

 Now I bricked my system and rather than restore it I figured I'd just install arch, since I still felt like I was missing something
 And I'm really glad I did, EOS might be 90% arch but that 10% is all really mostly unnecessary.
 My system boots faster(I think that's due to using xinitrc) my disk encryption is more secure and default i3wm looks and feels much better than EOS's version
 Now I can say "I use arch btw", without being a cop-out

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a bunch of child classes inheriting from a parent class. There's a private member called type in both parent and child class. I'm using public inheritance. Why does the getter of the parent respect the parent's private attribute first and not that of the child when I access it using a child instance?
 Is there some way to achieve this? I know I can just override the getter in all my child classes, but then what's the point of inheriting the parent class at all?
 Edit: I really should've thought more about the title lol, and should've added some code. 
 First, some context. I'm designing a terminal chess application. I have a piece class (kinda abstract) which has private attributes type and color
 There are different subclasses pawn, rook, etc. And their type attribute is initialised appropriately in each.
 Code (typing from mobile, forgive me)
 ```
 class Piece { private: PieceType: type = PieceType::NONE; PieceColor: color;
 public: PieceType getType() { return type; } }
 class Pawn : public Piece { private: PieceType type = PieceType::PAWN; } ```
 And in some other main function Pawn pawn; pawn.getType();
 Now this getType returns NONE, why doesn't it get the type attribute of the child and gets that of the parent? Currently I'm working around this by having a setter in parent and calling it for each child instance

        <updated>2024-05-30T06:28:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, a few days ago I watched a video called writing your own daemon in C which lead me to try to write one on my own in Rust. I am by no means a Rustacean, nor an expert. Just an average programmer curious about writing a service in Rust. 
 I call the Daemon birth-hound. It is as the name suggests a daemon which notifies you if it's anyone's birthday (it can be used for notifying you about other important dates as well!). It keeps track of a CSV file which includes the birth date and the person's name. Naturally the daemon checks for all the dates and then notifies using libnotify crate. 
 Here are my questions :
  
Is this too simple of an idea to be written as a daemon, as daemon's do consume cpu and ram resources
 
Is there another approach to do this? I discovered that systemd uses .timer which is used for scheduling programs, so instead of writing a long running process which actually excutes instructions once in a day, you could write a .timer file and in it tell it to execute the rust file to do the checking at 11:59pm everyday
 
Do you think it is a good idea to write it in a cli style app wherein the user can do a birth-hound start or birth-hound stop to start and stop the daemon to their wish
 
I would access the CSV file using File IO obviously, but should I asc users to create their own CSV file and ask them to manually enter it's path into the src code or should I provide them with a CSV myself, if it's the latter, how should I go about it?
 
 That's all the questions I have for now. Feel free to ask me more questions if you have any.
 Any sort of advise or guidance would be of great help!!! Thank you in advance and apologies if this seems to be noob questions I literally downloaded Rust two days ago and am trying to read the docs and figure my way out

But I don’t understand where API’s come in between this all? Is fetching from the frontend something related to API’s? Is get() post() on the backend to/from the database something related to API’s??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After hundreds of applications, as if each application was a side quest, it seemed I had unlocked the main quest when I reached the final stage for a Data Engineer position for Pratt & Whitney. The final interview went very well. The hiring manager (Very pleasant person) was very excited about me getting started ASAP because they were behind on a few projects and had a few more incoming. At the end of the interview, she assured me that they decided to hire me and to look out for the offer letter within a day or two. I was checking my email so often that I might have broken some record or two. The next day passed and no offer. The second day passed and no offer but now I am getting really nervous. On the third day, I get an email that they have decided to go with someone else.....
 I was crushed inside. This took all the wind out of me and now every time I fill out an application, my mood just drops when I remember this experience. 
 About a week after that I called the recruiter (who was present in all interviews) and kindly asked for feedback and then asked her why they went with someone else after I was explicitly told that they chose me.
 Her answer..... "The hiring manager wanted the other candidate because he had FiveTran experience...."
 I could not believe it. Fivetran was never brought up in the interviews and it is insanely easy to learn. I thanked her for her time and help and asked her to send me other opportunities she came across.
 Well, that is how I lost out on a Fully Remote Job with a $94k base salary at Pratt&Whittney. 
 :( Thank you for your time. Have a nice life.
 (Recent Grad with an internship and 2 yoe as a DE.)

 I would be using the Enum to populate the options in dropdown. I know that it would only have the options mentioned in the question. The options are not dynamic. If 'None" were not an option, I could have simply done the binding to a list.

 Anyone have any tips? Has anyone been in a similar position? Anyone currently in a similar situation and want to swap tips? Anyone know of any communities (or is this the place?) where I can talk to people who can relate?

 Here is strip down version of the code 
 1 . when i create DLL with all the required libraries and msvc files to run it works perfectly as aspected the problem arises when i ship the whole folder with dlls to another windows machine all parts work as aspected but the above code add extra 1 hour why 
 2 . This problem dont arise with linux , i tried ubuntu , mint etc it works greate 
 Again the dll works greate within my windows machine with tons of development environment , when i ship all the dlls to freshly installed win10 or win11 along with all the compiler files to run it adds extra one hour why??

 can you spot the bug? >! if(res == nullptr) return does not have a semicolon at the end so addCallback only is called when res is null!!! !<
 I got really annoyed although my warnings are on I did not get a warning like misleading indentation i guess that is why they say add brackets around your if statement always.
 What is your stupid simple bug you encountered?

I've had issues where it can't find WinMain, and doesn't tell me what code is causing it. All the issues that I have seem to be related to missing windows libraries or something.

 What is "breaking your system" in reference to? What are you people doing to your system where you have to constantly fix it? What kind of maintenance are you doing all the time that requires you to be a super advanced user? 
 I use TimeShift to backup my system prior to updating anything important (OS, Nvidia drivers, or anything related to Gnome, etc) or messing around with anything important (grub, specific apps, etc). If an issues occur, I revert back. It really isn't that complicated.
 Is this just gatekeeping? Am I completely missing something? For an average Linux user, is Arch REALLY that difficult?
 For reference, I have been using Arch for a few months now (before that, I used ZorinOS and Ubuntu). My system runs Gnome on Wayland with a Nvidia RTX 4080 graphics card. I have experienced zero lag, rubberbanding, or any other display issues. I also haven't experienced any issues "breaking my system". Graphics-intensive games run great on max settings with raytracing enabled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am making a super basic 2D game engine as a first project in c++ using SDL2 and (eventually) vulkan, but have experience in other languages. I have a private property of a class that keeps resetting itself, seemingly by magic. I have no clue why this could be happening as the property is only set to true in one place, but it is never executed more than once with this bug happening. I have looked at everything I could think of online to try to find an answer, I have tried changing the bool to an int or string and setting the values to anything else. I have stepped through the execution of my code line by line in visual studio with a watch on the property and it just magically sets itself to whatever I use as true. I made a branch of my project with this bug that can be found here: https://github.com/JordanDHayes/SDL-testing-1/tree/Broken 
 The property in question is needsUpdate of the windowHandler class. It sets itself to true at the beginning of the update method in the window class after it has been set to true once before, line 105 of "WindowHandler.cpp". Sorry for lack of comments and the images used for testing stuff, my sense of humor is broken. Maybe its something to do with memory being overwritten or something but I have no idea how that could happen

But since I insisted on full-remote, my pay has been matched up to the area where I actually live (Canada) - which is considerably lower than what my coworkers (in the bay area) make. But that's ok. I had accepted that.
 But, the company is not doing super-well. Over the last couple of years, the stock price has been tanking quarter after quarter. My TC dipped lower than what any standard FAANG is offering. And some of these are paying SF salaries even while being fully-remote, as long as I visit once a month or so - which I can totally do.
 I've proven myself invaluable to the business. An easy thing might to ask for a bump in pay to be in line with what my coworkers make. But haven't done that yet.
 I've applied to a few places to start interviews etc. Should I let my manager know that I am interviewing? If I open this news, I am pretty sure they will try to get me a pay bump.
 But what are some potential problems with this? Any advice would be very helpful.

 Is this common, or is it some beginner's mistake or bad habit? How detrimental are nested ifs and for loops? What tools can I use to avoid conditional statements and loops?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No matter where I look, people always recommend using header files. However, almost every time I use them, it results in multiple definition errors, even when using #pragma once (I also tried inlcude guards, which should be the same thing, but some people advised me to use it instead of #pragma once).
 For example, if I have a header file like this:
 #pragma once int variable; void Function(); 
 And I define the functions in a cpp file like this:
 void Function() { //code here } 
 When I include this header file in two different cpp files, it results in multiple definition errors.
 However, when I use header files just for classes, like this:
 #pragma once class Class { private: int variable; public: void Function(); } 
 And define the class in a cpp file like this:
 void Class::Function() { //code here } 
 The compiler does not find any problems.
 Am I using header files incorrectly? What would be the correct way to use them?
 Alternatively, I've been increasingly using extern variables and forward declarations. It usually works very well without the need for header files or #include.
 Is it bad practice to rely on the use of extern and forward declarations? Should I use more function pointers and lambdas? Pass more variables as parameters between functions in different files?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Woody because I got a Pocket386 handheld and it's the latest Debian that it'll run.
 When the kernel boots, it changes the screen mode to a 16-bit graphics mode for the console, but I want it to be true 80x25 text mode.
 Setting vga=0 in LILO conf does nothing. The kernel still switches to a graphics mode.
 Is there even anyone old enough in here to know the answer? lol
