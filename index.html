                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I&#x27;ve written a tool at the company I work at that basically allow you to autogenerate any boiler plate code based off a yaml file and a Jinja template schema. At work, we use to tool to autogenerate C++ classes that have built in serialize/deserialize functionality for all kinds of different message classes that we work with. I&#x27;ve also written templates that can autogenerate Protobuf converters that convert a C++ message object to its protobuf equivalent. This has been super handy for us because we work with many different C++ message classes and hand typing all the converters would be tedious and error prone. 
 My question is: I am debating making this tool open source, but want to see if other people who write C++ encounter similar problems to this and if a tool like this would be valuable and helpful before I spent a bunch of time re-working it and making it available on GitHub. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,So I&#x27;m displaying some simple text information, and I was wondering if someone can tell me a better way to do this to be more accurate depending on the changing text. The Log function essentially does this:
 std::cout &lt;&lt; std::format(&quot;{}\t\t{}\n&quot;, LogTypeToString(type), vformat(fmt, args));
 The displaying of the text:
 constexpr auto renderTextSize &#x3D; sizeof(renderer); Log(LogType::Info, &quot;{:*^{}} OpenGL Information {:*^{}}&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 16 + renderTextSize, &quot;&quot;, 16 + renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, &quot;* Version : {} ({}.{}) {:{}} *&quot;, version, glVersion[0], glVersion[1], &quot;&quot;, 26 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, &quot;* Vendor : {:{}} *&quot;, vendor, 52 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, &quot;* Renderer : {:{}} *&quot;, renderer, renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, &quot;* GLSL Version : {:{}} *&quot;, glslVersion, 52 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, &quot;{:*^{}}&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 76 - renderTextSize); 
 As you may see, since the renderer text seems to be the longest by nature I&#x27;m trying to use that as the complete width so that this box shape using &quot;*&quot; is always just a space ahead and everything else meets it. I got it to look good with my settings, but I&#x27;m wondering how it would look if my information was different. Something tells me it wouldn&#x27;t make a nice box.
  
[Info] ************************* OpenGL Information **************
 [Info] * Version : 4.6.0 NVIDIA 552.22 (4.6)
 [Info] * Vendor : NVIDIA Corporation
 [Info] * Renderer : NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Laptop GPU/PCIe/SSE2 * [Info] * GLSL Version : 4.60 NVIDIA [Info] **********************************************************
  
EDIT: It&#x27;s hard to get it to display here, but basically the first line makes as many &quot;*&quot; to the length of the Renderer: text. So that it would complete the so-called &quot;box.&quot;
 That&#x27;s how it displays in the console. Currently, everything is designed with my own hardware information in mind, but I&#x27;d like to make it dynamic.Thanks, and have a great day.

 I successfully printed out अ to cout on the terminal but when I open up output.txt there&#x27;s some garbage character which I believe is the End-Of-Inquiry character (ASCII value 5). How can I make this print properly to output.txt?

                              <span>For context: I am an electronics engineer by education and practice, but I switched to full time software development in 2016.
 By far, C and C++ has been most of my career. Dangerous languages perhaps, but languages that know they are dangerous, and document exactly where the sharp edges are located.
 However, for about a year and a half, I&#x27;ve been branching out and it appears to me that every single language and technology I look at has behaviors that are not defined. They just don&#x27;t admit to it.
 I opened an issue in docker&#x27;s documentation because they were missing an explanation for a behavior. Closed as resolved with, paraphrased, &quot;read the repository if you want to know how docker works.&quot;
 By that standard, C++ doesn&#x27;t have undefined behavior either! Just read your compiler&#x27;s source code and you&#x27;ll know what happens.
 Same problem with Microsoft&#x27;s Azure cloud services. Many guides and tutorials but no authoritative source that explains how Azure works, what each option does, and how they interact - or if there is, it&#x27;s sufficiently burrowed that I&#x27;ve been unable to find it after searching for a while, and their representatives cannot guide me to it either. Dotnet projects? Same issue again, there&#x27;s any number of properties you can set for your project and you just have to guess from their name what they will do - and don&#x27;t get me started on the difficulty of writing provably correct golang.
  
I can sign for the correctness of C/C++ software. I might be wrong because mistakes happen, but those are mistakes, not lies.
 I cannot sign off on most other software. If I claim that I know something is correct, I am lying. I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m guessing. &quot;It worked so far.&quot;
  
I can write software in all these languages, use all these other technologies. I cannot do engineering with them. I wish I could.

                              <span>What I mean is that is there a common thread to unit testing everywhere you go? Like can senior engineers expect to quickly be able to switch jobs and pick it up very quickly, or is it very uniquely defined for each company. I&#x27;d like to learn about it but for my somewhat trivial hobby projects I can&#x27;t figure out a use case.

                              <span>To be clear, I am aware that the code is already valid C++. I am able to run it without any issues, though I do get a warning from the compiler that the functionparam_sub_scalar is unused.
 The code is a relatively simple script that fits a quadratic to a few datapoints using gradient descent with an Adam optimizer. I am aware that there are easier ways of doing this, such as with least squares.
 The last few months, I&#x27;ve been working in embedded systems in C, but most of my programming experience is in data science with Rust and Python. This script was just something I wrote to have a bit of fun making C behave more like an OOP language with a task I&#x27;m more familiar with.
 I&#x27;ve since rewritten the script in Zig, but I also wanted to try rewriting it with C++. I&#x27;d also like to stick to exclusively using stuff from the standard library, if possible.
 Since I don&#x27;t have much experience with C++, are there any specific features I should try to advantage of here?
 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated
 (for those curious, the data should reflect y &#x3D; x^2 - 2*x + 1)
 Here is the C code:

 Can anyone help me adjust the code to print the Start-point “S” and End point “E” at the very corners of the maze? I provided an image of what I mean by “Very corners of the maze” Thank you very much.

 The maze output is generating like this

Newly installed msys2 and sfml (using pacman of msys2) on C drive. (Edit: I am using VS Code, new installation)
 Created project on drive D (I know, but I dont have that much space on my drives)
 Checked functionality of the setup with basic hello_world.cpp -&gt; WORKS
 Checked functionality of the SFML part of the setup with code from this https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-linux.php -&gt; DOES NOT WORK (compiling without errors, but nothing happens when executed, no window created, nothing)
  
Compile command:
 g++ src/main.cpp -o bin/a -I C:/msys64/mingw64/include -L C:/msys64/mingw64/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-system -lsfml-Window 
 So, I added:
 std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;test&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; 
 BUT STILL: no output in the console, no window created by sfml, no errors while compiling or executing
 Thank you for any help I can get

However, I also need to use MeCab as a library in this app, and it does not use CMake.
 I know that CMake can also work with non-CMake libraries, but I&#x27;m not good enough with it to figure out how to implement this correctly.
 So far I have this CMakeLists file: https://pastebin.com/SJQcz5Eq
 MeCab compile instructions look like this: https://imgur.com/a/i7TTY9C
 What should I add to CMakeLists to make it work?

 I&#x27;m a novice when it comes to C++ and CMake. I created a small project using the libigl library, and used their sample project as a starting point, replacing the main.cpp with my own .cpp file and uncommenting the libigl modules I used in the CMakeLists.txt.
 Now I also want to add fTetWild to my project and use it via function wrapper. That wiki doesn&#x27;t explain how to do so, but I&#x27;m assuming it works just like outlined in the slightly older TetWild project.
 So, what I did is:
  
In my project folder, create an fTetWild folder and put the full fTetWild project in there
 
In fTetWild, create a build folder, go to the build folder and do cmake .. and make. This does a bunch of stuff, some of which is crea…</span>

I am just tempted to use spinlock since I am not allowed to use mutex/locks etc. I still gave the lockfree map a try. In my implementation, I am getting a snapshot of the current map, updating with a value, then compare swapping. I am sure it has a lot of mistakes and redundant copies of the whole thing. Please advise on the best way to do this.
 struct ThreadSafeMap { private: using MapType &#x3D; std::unordered_map&gt;; std::atomic _map; public: ThreadSafeMap(): _map{new MapType{}} { } ~ThreadSafeMap() { delete _map.load(); } void set(const std::string&amp; key, const std::string&amp; value) { MapType* expected &#x3D; nullptr; MapType* map_snapshot &#x3D; nullptr; do { if (map_snapshot) { // Cleanup from unsuccessful atomic update, outdated. delete map_snapshot; } // Get a snapshot expected &#x3D; _map.load(); map_snapshot &#x3D; new MapType{*expected}; auto it &#x3D; map_snapshot-&gt;find(key); if (it !&#x3D; map_snapshot-&gt;end()) { // found, update. it-&gt;second.push_back(value); } else { // not found, add. it &#x3D; map_snapshot-&gt;insert({key, {value}}).first; } } while(!_map.compare_exchange_strong(expected, map_snapshot)); if (expected) { // Successful atomic update. delete expected; } } std::optional&gt; get(const std::string&amp; key) { // Get a snapshot MapType* expected &#x3D; _map.load(); // Set might have already deleted this pointer.

 If the range I&#x27;m copying from returns a sentinel type for its .end(), which is different from the iterator type returned by my .begin(), then I can&#x27;t use this constructor? My only other option is to move my range in using a for-loop?

 This works fine by providing a constructor in the promise_typelike below (Godbolt): 
 struct S; class Wrapper { public: class promise_type { S *_s; public: promise_type(S &amp;s) { _s &#x3D; &amp;s; std::cout : In member function &#x27;Wrapper T::sub()&#x27;: :41:5: error: no matching function for call to &#x27;Wrapper::promise_type::promise_type()&#x27; 41 | } | ^ :14:9: note: candidate: &#x27;Wrapper::promise_type::promise_type(S&amp;)&#x27; 14 | promise_type(S &amp;s) | ^~~~~~~~~~~~ :14:9: note: candidate expects 1 argument, 0 provided :11:11: note: candidate: &#x27;constexpr Wrapper::promise_type::promise_type(const Wrapper::promise_type&amp;)&#x27; 11 | class promise_type { | ^~~~~~~~~~~~ :11:11: note: candidate expects 1 argument, 0 provided :11:11: note: candidate: &#x27;constexpr Wrapper::promise_type::promise_type(Wrapper::promise_type&amp;&amp;)&#x27; :11:11: note: candidate expects 1 argument, 0 provided Compiler returned: 1 
 This can be fixed with concepts (Godbolt):
 template  concept IsDerivedFromBaseRef &#x3D; std::is_base_of_v&gt;; ... template  promise_type(Derive&amp; derived) requires IsDerivedFromBaseRef { _s &#x3D; &amp;derived; std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Derived Ref &quot; &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;; } 
 Does anyone know why this is? And is my fix using concepts robust? 
 Cheers
 Edit: 
 This seems to be a GCC bug. On Clang Trunk it works. On GCC Trunk, you get a internal compiler error that has already been reported

                              <span>This is a simple program, to keep track of employees, by name (std::string) and time (int) they worked. I have declared globally my vector of Employee classes.
 Everything works fine except the getEntryTime() function. My goal was to input the name and it will return the time that employee worked.
 To make it short, you can scroll over to the getEntryTime() function. Everything worked but in here it requires me to pass a Student class a a parameter to the lambda function:
 #include  #include  #include  #include  #include  #include  //First problem is using class and std::vector //Track employees name and time worked class Employee { public: std::string_view m_name{}; int m_time{}; Employee(std::string_view name, int time) :m_name{name}…</span>

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve built this lock-free single produce multiple consumer queue. The queue works fine on x86 (amd &amp; intel procs), but seems to choke on aarch64. For both architectures I am using gcc 13.2 with ( -mcpu&#x3D;neoverse-v1) specified for aarch64. I have run with both -O2 and -O3 and see the issue repo with both. The issue that I am seeing is that occasionally when multiple consumers concurrently consume from the queue two consumers end up with the same &#x27;item&#x27; value even with a different tail value. For example, given 3 threads T1, T2, T2; if T1 is the producer and stores a value A at index 1 (head &#x3D;&#x3D; 1), and B at index 2 (head &#x3D;&#x3D; 2). Concurrently T2 and T3 are dequeuing, T2 gets A (tail &#x3D;&#x3D; 1) and T3 sees tail &#x3D;&#x3D; 2, but still gets the value A (not B). So even though T3 has the proper tail value i…</span>

I&#x27;m sure most folks here have experience having to deal with emulating a feature from a future C++ standard, or some other task that might fit in the STL. What&#x27;s given you the least headaches? Does Boost remain king to y&#x27;all?

                              <span>With recent breakthroughs being made on the N64 scene such as Ship of Harkinian for Ocarina of Time and the now released Zelda64Recomp project for Majora&#x27;s Mask, discussion has opened up regarding the difficulties of emulating N64 throughout the years and alternative solutions moving forward. While previous projects have brought many games to a playable state over the years, many audio and visual effects end up getting lost lost in translation. With these recops projects, were now able to get fully intact ports of these games in all their glory with plenty of enhancements as well.
  
Zelda64 Recomp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ywWwUuWRgsM
  
With there now being a healthy interest for N64 from both fans and developers regarding these recent projects, it got me thinking about other consoles such as the OG Xbox and Sega Saturn that also have a troubled history with emulation progress over the years. How cool would it be to have decomp/recomp projects for games like Jet Set Radio Future and Panzer Dragoon Orta?
 For those of you with experience working on such consoles, how feasible do you see this? Is this something that has piqued the interest of anyone in these communities?
 Looking forward to hear what you guys have to say. Recompilation looks to be a much more accessible alternative to the undertaking that a full decomp entails.

The ls in the ll integer suffix must have the same case, so u, ul, lu, ull, llu, U, Ul, lU, Ull, llU, uL, Lu, uLL, LLu, UL, LU, ULL and LLU are all valid but Ll, lL, and uLl are not.
 You use octal way more than you think: 0 is an octal constant.
 strtod need not exactly match the compilation-time float syntax conversion.
 The punctuators (sic) : EDOM (domain error, for math errors), EILSEQ (&quot;illegal sequence&quot;; encoding error for wchar stuff), and ERANGE (range error).
 You can use universal character names in identifiers. int \u20a3 &#x3D; 0; is perfectly valid C.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to programming, I want to code in C running my code with the Code Runner extension. I have MinGW installed with the proper packages. When I run the code it runs successfully in the Output, but i want to work with inputs so I want my code to run in the terminal. I ticked the run in terminal setting in the extension&#x27;s setting but when now I go and run it this error shows up in the terminal:
 cd &quot;C:\Users\MTB35F~1\AppData\Local\Temp\&quot; ; if ($?) { gcc tempCodeRunnerFile.c -o tempCodeRunnerFile } ; if ($?) { .\tempCodeRunnerFile }
 cd : An object at the specified path C:\Users\MTB35F~1 does not exist.
 At line:1 char:1

 + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 + CategoryInfo : InvalidArgument: (:) [Set-Location], PSArgumentException
 + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Argument,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.SetLocationCommand
 This whole thing works on my laptop, but not on my desktop computer, and I have no clue why. Also I don&#x27;t recognize the &quot;MTB35F~1&quot; user. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Does the standard require that pointer-to-array types should have the same representation as their corresponding pointer-to-element types?
 For example, is it always guaranteed that the pointer types int (*)[], int (*)[][1], int (*)[][1][1] (and so on) will have the same representation as int *?
 Use case: Mostly an artificial scenario, but this legitimizes passing pointer-to-element (without conversion) to a function expecting pointer-to-array (or vice-versa).
 void foo(int *, ...); void bar(int (*)[], ...); void baz(int (*)[][1], ...); void test(void) { enum {nrows &#x3D; 2, ncols &#x3D; 3}; int arr[nrows][ncols] &#x3D; {0}; void (*fn)(int *, ...); fn &#x3D; foo; fn(*arr, nrows, ncols); fn &#x3D; (typeof (fn))bar; fn(*arr, nrows, ncols); fn &#x3D; (typeof (fn))baz; fn(*arr, nrows, ncols); }

                              <span>Hi there,
 I am building a Satellite (ST) to Ground Stations (GS) distributed communication system, and I am at the point where I am implementing leader election among satellites and async undirected graph based leader election for the ground stations. The election processes do indeed finish, upon which point the coordinator process (rank n-1) sends out the ST leader to all GS processes and the GS leader to all ST processes respectively.
 Everything works fine for the ST election and message passing, but for some reason, when the coordinator sends out the GS_ELECT event to all ST processes after the GS leader election, the ST processes do not receive the event. I tried logging the probe&#x27;s tag, and it is just always START_LELECT_ST and no matter what event is sent afterward, it just never changes the status of the probe, neither with GS_LEADER nor with TERMINATE.
 The relevant ST receiving part is on line 200 of the pastebin source code. I am busting my head trying to figure out why this is happening since if I am not mistaken, MPI_Probe and MPI_Iprobe should be seeing the pending new events and grabbing their tags.
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

 I have a scenario with three separate struct definitions that contain their own data that will be sent to separate threads. However, two of the structs need to be able to read some information about a 3rd struct periodically in their own threads.
 I have mocked up a scenario (without involving thread boilerplate) that might help me generally understand the necessary semantics of shared memory across structs.
 #include  #include  struct struct_one { struct struct_three *s3; }; struct struct_two { int some_data; struct struct_three *s3; }; struct struct_three { int some_more_data; }; int main(void) { // heap allocate my first struct struct struct_one *struct1; struct1 &#x3D; malloc(sizeof(struct struct_one)); // heap allocate my second struct struct struct_two *struct2;…</span>

I obviously want to and have to keep it legal so I was wondering if you know any websites that let me legally showcase some SQL hacking action. Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all, after a bit of research, I believe I have a dormakaba 10620 key fob for my apartment that I would like to have cloned. My apartment does not issue spare keys and I would like one for my girlfriend.
 I’m pretty sure it’s 13.52 mhz mifare, but there appears to be 3 different models, 1k, 2k, and 4K - Im not sure which one. There is zero identifying details on my fob, no text or markings. Please see the attached pictures.
 After looking into a bit it, it appears the promark3 or a service such as “clone my key” / a key duplicating kiosk could work.
 What would be the simplest / not super expensive path forward?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently developing a prison-escape game, basically very similar to &quot;The Escapists&quot; but in a low-poly 3D setting. The steam shop page exists for a few months, not resulting in many wishlists, which I would expect for a hobby project without marketing (except for a few YouTube shorts (~100-400 views each)).
 So the daily wishlists were around 0-1, mostly 0. Then, a few days ago, I checked the tags again, and compared them to the tags to &quot;The Escapists&quot;, since the gameplay is pretty similar.
 Here is my little/big fuck-up: The tag I initially set with the highest priority is (in german) &quot;Ausbruchssimulation&quot;, which can also be understood as a game where you/the player has to break out of somewhere. I was kinda wondering why &quot;The Escapists&quot; is not tagged with the same tag, as I would imagine it is the most fitting for this kind of game.
 I looked at the games that were tagged with &quot;Ausbruchssimulation&quot;, saw stuff like Pague Inc. etc., and had an epiphany: changed the language to english, &quot;Ausbruchssimulation&quot; is the translation for &quot;Outbreak Sim&quot;.
 Yeah, so i removed the tag and (at least for the four days since) this also had an impact on daily wishlists: https://ibb.co/GHgBXxh

                              <span>Nine months ago, with my only experience being far too many hours spent watching devlog videos on Youtube, I started my first game project. An estimated 600 hours later, the Steam release is just over a week away. 
 It&#x27;s a very basic game, but I learnt a huge amount making it and so wanted to share some takeaways and reflections:
  
 Art…
 I chose pixel art because I thought it would be easier than the other art styles. I no longer think this. The idea that “there are only so many ways you can arrange 32x32 pixels” was very naïve. I did however find that this limitation forced me to be creative in a way that didn’t sacrifice consistency, and consistency seemed to be worth a lot more than assets that were individually ‘good’.
 One of the biggest jumps forwards in the art was sticking to a c…</span>

                              <span>Hey guys, I’m a devops engineer with 1 year experience. This is my first actual job and I went straight into devops because my interests align here. I am stuck in my current job because there is nothing more to do. I have revamped the entire infrastructure of my (medium sized - multi million) company, terraforming the infrastructure, managing and improving deployments, improved kubernetes, docker images, pipelines, etc…
 Now my company hired 3 new devops engineers for a different company because they are cheaper but s the tasks go to them. Because of that I had a lot of free time, but I’m actually losing motivation for devops. Automating used to be my passion but now I’m in a bit of a rut
 Due to certain personal circumstances I can’t leave the job at current moment; although I thought about it because I’m kinda reaching the ceiling of this company.
 If anyone has any advice, I would appreciate it

At first, that looks pretty straight forward: initiate a new client at start time, attach it to the server struct and access the client from anywhere, like a singleton.
 Now, say I have a Gitlab client that sends requests on behalf of an user which has provided an access token. I cannot initiate the client at start time and reuse it (setting the token before calling the api) because I could have race conditions where an user ends up with the token from someone else, so sharing an authenticated client seems like a no go. 
 I think I could create a client per http request, making it unique per client, but then if I only make one call to gitlab per request it&#x27;s the same thing as never reusing the client.
 Do I make sense? How should I go for such use cases?

                              <span>Introduced some huge aesthetic changes, and added functionality to transition between environmental states. Also added some music, and the player can now go from level to level. 
 I would like some feedback, though: one of the changes I made was that the level now features flickering lights, and my concern is that they might bother some people. I would love to hear some opinions on this. I like the effect but obviously I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable while playing. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi r/godot,
 I&#x27;ve been working on a project called GodotInGameBuildingSystem, aimed at helping developers easily integrate building mechanics into their Godot games. It’s straightforward, open-source, and I hope it can be useful to some of you!
 Features:
  
Dynamic Building: Add robust building functions that allow players to construct and customize their environments.
 Customizable: Adjust it to suit your game’s unique style and needs.
 Written in C#: Currently available in C#, ensuring robust performance and integration.
 Open Source: Free to use and modify under the MIT License—contributions are welcome!
  
Why consider it?
 It’s built specifically for Godot, making integration smooth, and it’s a great way to add interactive elements to your game. I’d love for you to try it out and share any feedback or suggestions!
 Future Plans:
 I am planning to develop a version in GDScript based on community interest. The sooner I see significant interest, the faster I&#x27;ll work on releasing the GDScript version!
 👉 See it on Asset Store
 Thanks for checking it out, and happy developing!

 What could I do to make and play the game with sentences instead of just words? I thought to create a simple function that removes all white spaces, and then just make it work as with words, but I don‘t know if that’s the best approach. Any advice? Thanks in advanced!

                              <span>For example, I downloaded Visual Studio with the intent to set it up for programming strictly in C. However, I never see any mention of C when choosing templates or other options. C++ is all over the place, but it doesn&#x27;t seem obvious to a newer programmer that C is a common language that merits its own setup, tutorials, and template options in IDEs such as VS.
 Why wouldn&#x27;t C be more... obvious? Why the assumptions that a C++ environment is suitable for someone wanting to program in C?
 Appreciate any thoughts from the community on the matter.

 PSA: I&#x27;m learning C for my class in 2nd year of college for algorithms and data structures and I find my course material in college not very understandable so I&#x27;m trying to find some sources to exercise, learn and test my knowledge.

                              <span>Hello, I try to calc a checksum sumatory 4096 of two byte but I can&#x27;t solve.
 I have two data line of example:
 B6 61 87 C0 83 80 9C 80 A1 80 80 80 80 80 89 89 89 89 80 80 80 80 B3 81 80 C0 FE 81 80 80 8D 83 80 80 C2 82 87 D8 80 C9 80 E0 80 C5 80 D1 80 80 B7 84 82 80 FF 82 &quot;E5 9E&quot;
 and
 B6 61 83 C0 80 C0 9C 80 A1 80 80 80 80 80 89 89 89 89 80 80 80 80 B3 81 80 C0 FE 81 80 80 8D 83 80 80 C2 82 86 D8 80 C9 80 E0 80 C5 80 D1 80 80 B7 84 82 80 FF 82 &quot;9D 9F&quot;
 The checksum sumatory is the two last byte.
 I saw in the manual that the kind of checksum is 4096.
 I try to calculate the checksum 256 with this web but only coincide the first byte and not always.

 Here what i want is to get icons with the process details. Eg: chrome icon with its process, teams icon …etc
 I want to run this on both mac and windows.
 Although I have found a solution for windows using Icon.ExtractAssociatedIcon().
 I want a solution for mac or one that can be used on all platforms.

                              <span>Hey all. So, as a challenge to myself to actually start doing projects in C, I decided to make a ncurses-based implementation of Conway&#x27;s Game of Life. Part of the logic involves storing the current state in one matrix, and using that to build a second matrix for the next generation&#x27;s state. Each cycle, the &#x27;next state&#x27; (we&#x27;ll call it m2) becomes the &#x27;previous state&#x27; (m1), and my first implementation simply involved looping through the matrices and overwriting each cell of m1 with the corresponding cell of m2. While this works fine, I wanted to do it more &quot;optimally&quot; by simply swapping two pointer addresses. This is the function that I came up with:
 void swap_ptr(int (**p1)[ROWS][COLS], int (**p2)[ROWS][COLS]) { int (*tmp)[ROWS][COLS] &#x3D; *p1; *p1 &#x3D; *p2; *p2 &#x3D; tmp; return; } 
 The implementation looks like this:
 int matrix1[ROWS][COLS]; int matrix2[ROWS][COLS]; int (*m1)[ROWS][COLS] &#x3D; &amp;matrix1; int (*m2)[ROWS][COLS] &#x3D; &amp;matrix2; /* main loop starts, insert Life logic here to populate m2 based on the contents of m1*/ display(*m2); swap_ptr(&amp;m1, &amp;m2); 
 This appears to be working fine, but it&#x27;s not at all like the methods I found online for the same thing, which instead called for something more like:
 void swap_ptr(int ***p1, int ***p2); 
 Is there something wrong with the way I&#x27;m doing it, or is this just one of those funny C things where there&#x27;s multiple &quot;correct&quot; ways to do something? Thanks in advance!
 EDIT: fixed typos in my code examples.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Work for an agency so I generally do client work. I&#x27;ve been with my current client for an unusually long time (years) which is my longest term engagement and they&#x27;re very happy with me. It&#x27;s a non-tech company in a lucrative industry.
 The work is generally easy but I am the only developer in the organization. As such, the work I do is often glueing their SaaS products together in some way or building small internal tools for my stakeholders. Don&#x27;t really exercise my dev muscles often and the easiest (least complicated) solution is often the best one for their needs.
 The pay is great and generally the WLB is comfortable, but I don&#x27;t work with any other devs and really feel my skills deprecating over time. The pay is at the top-end of what my expected range would be like so it&#x27;s difficult to make a change without taking a pay cut. I worry that whenever this engagement ends (they always do), I will be a much worse dev than I was prior to working here. However, it&#x27;s hard to not make hay while the sun is shining, so to speak, and just collect the easy money while it&#x27;s here.
 What would you do?

                              <span>So we have a fairly new CTO thats pushing for various different process changes in dev teams. 
 Two of these is trunk based development and full time pair programming to enable CI/CD. 
 For context my team looks after a critical area of our platforms (the type where if we screw up serious money can be lost and we&#x27;ll have regulators to answer to). We commit to repos that are contributed to by multiple teams and basically use a simplified version of Gitflow with feature branches merging into master only when fully reviewed &amp; tested and considered prod ready. Once merged to master the change is released to prod. 
 From time to time we do pair programming but tend to only do it when it&#x27;s crunch time where necessary. The new process basically wants this full time. Devs have trialed this and feel burned out doing the pair programming all day everyday. 
 Basically I ran my team on the idea of trunk based development and they&#x27;re heavily against it including the senior devs (one of whom called it &#x27;madness&#x27;). 
 The main issue from their perspective is they consider it risky and few others don&#x27;t think it will actually improve anything. I&#x27;m not entirely clued up on where manual QA testing fits into the process either but what I&#x27;ve read suggests this takes place after merge to master &amp; even release which is a big concern for the team. Devs know that manual QA&#x27;s capture important bugs via non-happy paths despite having a lot of automated tests and 100% code coverage. We already use feature flags for our projects so that we only expose this to clients when ready but devs know this isn&#x27;t full proof.
 We&#x27;ve spoken about perhaps trialing this with older non-critical apps (which didn&#x27;t get much buy in) and changes are rarely needed on these apps so I don&#x27;t see us actually being able to do this any time soon whereas the CTO (and leadership below) is very keen for all teams to take this all on by this summer.

                              <span>I gathered this data from the two most comprehensive sources out there: TrueUp.io and Layoffs.fyi.
 Here&#x27;s a quick summary of the findings below:
  
There are 29.5% more tech job openings today than the low hit last March, and this positive trend has been largely steady
 The YoY number of average daily tech layoffs has declined by roughly 20%
  
Notes on the stats below: the difference in total numbers is due to TrueUp&#x27;s much larger dataset (it tracks more startups &amp; non-US markets). Both still show a nice improvement --- the decline in average daily layoffs is around 24% on TrueUp and 14% on Layoffs.fyi. Also, I rounded the figures to the nearest 1K.
 TrueUp.io
  
There are 211K open tech jobs today; there were 163K at the March 3, 2023 low. That said, the peak was 478K in April &#x27;22
 In 2023, there were 429K people laid off by 2,001 tech companies (an average of 1,175 people/day)
 So far in 2014, there have been 118K people laid off by 540 tech companies (an average of 891 people/day)
  
Layoffs.fyi
  
In 2023, there were 263K people laid off by 1,191 tech companies (an average of 721 people/day)
 So far in 2014, there have been 81K people laid off by 287 tech companies (an average of 619 people/day)
  
If it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s improving, hang in there. No market moves in a straight line...but at least the bumpy ride appears to be on the right track!

                              <span>Hi.
 I&#x27;m looking at the following scenario: A (enterprise) team went the microservices route. Unfortunately there is zero data locality, everything is layered horizontally (persistence service, entity A logic service, entity B logic service, etc) and everything depends on everything else. Services keep each in other sync via synchronous RPC over network. In short, it&#x27;s a distributed monolith.
 The project has progressed too far to make major architecture changes, and we need to move fast.
 We will soon have the foreseeable issue that keeping state synchronized across multiple distributed services and databases is hard. I shudder to think how the current system would behave during outages, and the many inconsistent states it will get in. I fear that if we don&#x27;t intervene now, it will turn into a maintenance nightmare on release.
 If you&#x27;ve been in a similar situation, which eventual consistency pattern did you go with, and what was your experience? My main concern is keeping implementation overhead as low as possible. I&#x27;ve thought about the usual at-least-once event-driven + idempotency route, but I&#x27;m worried about the overhead during day-to-day development, and amount of changes required to even get started with that. Maybe try 2 phase commits instead?
 If you&#x27;ve been in a similar situation of trying to work with a distributed monolith, I&#x27;d be curious to hear what you went with, and what your experience was.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed a pattern in my career:
  
At first everything is great. Honeymoon period.
 Then several hardships happened. But since I am still following the team&#x27;s mission, no problemo.
 Then random reorgs happened. I wasn&#x27;t impacted so no big deal.
 Then random projects unrelated to the (what I thought to be the main) mission appeared. I start getting confused.
 Then productivity dipped.
 Burnt out.
  
Of course the answer is always to look for a new job. But how can I get better at the timing? Preferably, how can I move on before reaching burnt out? How can I ride the waves better when various random unrelated projects appeared (after all, we are all just a pawn in the cog regardless how many ownerships I shown)?
 Edit: 25 YoE functioning as architect at various large companies. Spearheaded many successful large projects as well as failed projects.

 I&#x27;ve seen some high functioning garbage. VB6 written by interns full of gotos and inline sql manipulating data on the most de-normalized database with the most nonsense column names. Businesses built on a mountain of that intractable spaghetti, moving millions and millions of your dollars every day. ML javascript written by biotech post-docs doing god-knows-what processing your DNA data. Reactive message / trigger systems so complex you couldn&#x27;t graph the whole thing it if you tried.
 I won&#x27;t pretend I&#x27;ve seen it all but I&#x27;m realizing what I&#x27;m willing to tolerate is lessening as I get older. That or the environments I&#x27;m in just suck?

 Googletest no longer supports use of Autotools and it looks to me as if it will be simpler to rewrite my unit tests than to stop using Autotools.
 What options are there for an Autotools-friendly testing framework for C++?

 I know that std::vector or std::array is pretty standard (storing a string and an integer) and putting them inside a Class. But I&#x27;m getting to know std::unordered_map and std::map and they seem be extremely useful in this cases since they store elements as key-value pairs. So it becomes very easy to add, retrieve and manipulate.
 So getting back to the original question, in your expert experience what would be the best way to solve these type of problem? Going for std::unordered_list, using a std::vectors, or anything else? 
 Thanks!
 EDIT: Providing more information: I&#x27;ll need to add daily new members, and get information from them, so storing large amounts of data. The speed in which it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s not really that important.

                              <span>So I have recently started with Linux and don&#x27;t have Visual Studio. There are two options either go with Neovim or use CLion, I have a little experience with Vim as a Editor and was wondering with which one should I continue. My inclination is towards learning Neovim so I was wondering if it would be a right choice to go with it. Can it provide every functionality that an IDE does.

                              <span>So I have 10 projects each of which uses a file say important.cpp.. There&#x27;s a function in this file that takes a function as an argument. Now I want to call this function to be defined in another project ProjectA/file1.cpp. How do I do this.. 
 One approach I tried was declaring extern function() in important.cpp and then defining in file1.cpp.. While projectA built successfully.. Rest were failing due to linker error.. Symbols not resolved.
 Remember this function in important.cpp that takes in another function has default set as to null for fn.

Converting a function pointer to an object pointer type or vice versa is conditionally-supported.
  
Are there compilers where it is not supported?
 I have seen only compilers which support it. However, I haven&#x27;t seen all compilers. My guess, is that the answer comes from an area like the following ones:
  
Maybe a category of compilers does not support it, like e.g. &quot;it is typically not supported when you compile for processor/architecture X&quot;.
 It may be supported in all compilers nowadays, but it was not commonly supported say in the 1980s.

                              <span>I can join the strings (or anything string-like, string_view or const char*) with a constant delimiter like:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; template  struct SlashJoiner { std::ranges::ref_view view; };
 template  SlashJoiner(R) -&gt; SlashJoiner;
 template  struct std::formatter, CharT&gt; : range_formatter, CharT&gt; { constexpr formatter() { range_formatter, CharT&gt;::set_brackets(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;); range_formatter, CharT&gt;::set_separator(&quot; / &quot;); }
 auto format(const SlashJoiner&amp; joiner, auto&amp; ctx) const { return range_formatter, CharT&gt;::format(joiner.view, ctx); } 
 }; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And its usage would be:
  std::vector words { &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;def&quot;, &quot;ghi&quot; }; std::format(&quot;{::s}&quot;, SlashJoiner { words }); // &quot;abc / def / ghi&quot; 
 Now I want to specify the delimiter in Joiner struct, like:
  template  struct Joiner { std::ranges::ref_view view; std::string_view delimiter; }; 
 However, format function must be const, therefore it doesn&#x27;t let me call set_separator inside of it. What would be simple way for handle this problem?
  
Of course I know fmt::join and its implementation, but I&#x27;m curious that is there any fancy solution that using range_formatter&#x27;s ability by any chance.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I&#x27;m a beginner and currently trying to do an assignment which needs you to read from a text file. I am given a bunch of names and a set of numbers (don&#x27;t ask what those numbers mean). So the text file looks something like this:
 Michael 0 5 12 6 15 
 Jessica 1 3 4 8 20 
 George Martin 1 3 4 8 20 
 Olivia 2 8 10 12 17
 I have to store a name and the numbers for each participant. I know how to read from a text file, but I have problems with the third name. As you can see the third name has a space in between, but I still have to store it into one variable. This is the part which I am stuck at, since I know that if I write:
 fileIn &gt;&gt; name; 
 fileIn &gt;&gt; number[0] 
 it will store George as a name and then it will try to store &quot;Martin&quot; into the numbers array. What would be your approach in solving this problem? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to have a way to know how long a portion of my code takes to execute. In python, I would have done this by getting the current time at the start, and at the end, and taking the difference.
 The only way I&#x27;ve found to actually get this time is using time.h (as shown here), but this seems incredibly convoluted for just timing some blocks of code. Is there a better way to go about this?

                              <span>My understanding is that there is benefit to be had from sequential read access for data types equal to or smaller then 32 bytes because more then one can be loaded per cache line. Is there some benefit for larger data types? To ask the question another way: does memory locality / cache coherence matter at all when the desired bits are not in the same cache line?

                              <span>Hi DevOps Engineers! 
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with RAG (retrieval augmented generation) with terraform projects to build something useful in the world of DevOps. I&#x27;ve been asking my software friends what pain points they experience in the cloud deployment aspect of DevOps, especially when it comes to creating and managing cloud infrastructure. 
 I wanted to utilize my knowledge in ML and AI to perhaps enhance or improve DevOps workflows but I need to learn and listen to what the actual difficulties DevOps Engineers face in companies that I could perhaps explore as a hobby. 
 It would be amazing if people share problems that DevOps Engineers see could be solved by implementing some codebase integration with RAG and then perhaps using retrieved info with LLMs to make informed decisions? 
 I recently created a short demo which converts natural language queries to a runnable terraform deployment (The agent I coded for this hobby project also fetches relevant config parameters that might be needed for the Terraform Code). I wish I could embed it here but I don&#x27;t want to link my YouTube for the sake of anonymity. 
 Also, I&#x27;m just throwing ideas out here that aren&#x27;t fully fleshed out and looking for inspiration!

                              <span>I have several projects I need to support. Currently the infra provisioning (gcp, kubernetes etc) is in terraform. I’m trying to figure out what practices people use to let developers self manage what the requirements are for each individual project without seeing/interfering with each other.
 I’m imagining perhaps just argocd to monitor some kubectl files stored in each project repo, plus maybe some kind of yaml file to tell me what databases, redis, etc they need provisioned, then based on ci/cd pipeline i just have a job that parses the yaml and generates terraform config in the background? I don’t really want to have all teams messing about in the master terraform repo

 I&#x27;ve posted about Kviklet (pronounced &quot;Quicklet&quot;) multiple times in the past and got some very valuable feedback and some excitement by the community.
 Although I current don&#x27;t plan on founding a company around it and instead am just building a simple open-source tool for production access, there has been some significant progress.
 If you haven&#x27;t heard about Kviklet yet I recommend to skim through the Readme or one of the linked posts to get an idea.
 Enough introduction, this is what&#x27;s new in 0.3:
  
An integration with Kubernetes Exec, you can now run commands on other pods after they&#x27;ve been approved through kviklet. The idea behind this is that you can audit your script executions through Kviklet as well as database acces. If this works well we wi…</span>

                              <span>I recently had a very weird and interesting bug and thought I would share as a cautionary tale.
 I had put out a small demo of my game in order drum up some publicity and get some feedback on the basic mechanics. I wrote the game in Monogame using entirely my own code. For the most part, the demo went down well without any bugs. However, 2 of the players experienced some very weird bugs. Luckily I caught this on video. 
  
First of all, the intro cutscene was extremely zoomed in, to the point where it was unintelligible.
 
The user interface was completely absent. Except for the life counter, but that was on the wrong side. 
 
The background for the second world was absent. The other worlds had their static background display but the dynamic elements were also abscent.
 
The fade-out anima…</span>

                              <span>On Twitter, there is a fun challenge going on:
 Pick any constant in your game code, multiply by 1000, and post the results.
 I had fun making my entry! Photons with 1000x the power. Somehow, my photon-mapper still managed to produce recognizable results.
 I guess most x1000 constants would totally break a game, but I was rather pleased with my experiment. The game felt like wandering the wastelands during a hydrogen bomb detonation. Interesting visuals! 
 Did you participate in the challenge? If so, let&#x27;s share on this subreddit too!

                              <span>Game development is a tough journey, if you plan to be successful.
 We have just crossed 2k sales 1yr after launch. Most of the recent ones on huge discounts, so we decided today to drop the regular price from 15$ to 5$.
 Background:
 We developed a game with three people for about three years next to our day-time jobs. We thought the idea of combining RPG and a guild collection topic with auto chess combat mechanics would be a fun one. And for a niche audience it actually is! Each positive review on steam makes me happy, and also the negative ones are mostly constructive, or it is just not someone&#x27;s cup of tea. We don&#x27;t take it personal. :-)
 Still, we hoped for a bit of a better outcome.
 A lesson learned is that marketability (appeal and readability) of the game is super important, and …</span>

I do see some huge differences in some areas, but not sure if I should quit or keep going. They are way farther along than I am, Kickstarter and all. What have some of you done when you have this happen? Suggestions, pep talks, and stop panicking face slaps needed, lol.

                              <span>With the newest set of bugfixes, the experimental Rust to .NET compiler backend is coming closer and closer to being usable!
 The std built by the project is now functional enough to handle things like creating/writing to files, and writing to stdout / stderr.
 This small snippet of Rust code:
 use std::io::Write; fn main(){ println!(&quot;Hello from Rust to .NET!&quot;); std::fs::File::create(&quot;/tmp/rust_on_dotnet.txt&quot;).unwrap().write_all(b&quot;Hi from Rust, .NET&quot;).unwrap(); eprintln!(&quot;We are writing to stderr!&quot;); } 
 Can now run without issues within the .NET runtime!
 While this week has been a bit busy for me (first 3 final exams), I still made some progress in other areas too.
 Besides this, I have also eliminated 2 memory corruption errors (one related to closures, one related to small constant values). Those issues were found using valgrind - a memory debuting tool, which I now use to verify the Rust code compiled for .NET behaves correctly (the runtime can run under valgrind, if the right flags are set).
 I have also finished a round of extensive fuzzing (46 434 773 LOC of MIR test programs), which allowed me to find and patch many other issues (mostly related to floating-point numbers).
 Some issues still remain (13 out of 10 000 generated tests still fail, and the fuzzing tool I use does not check for every kind of bug), but a lot more Rust code should now compile properly.
 There is still a lot of work to do, but I wanted to share some of the progress.
 Also, the project has reached 1024(2^10) stars on GitHub! So, I would like to thank people for the amazing reception my project has had!
 If you have any questions/suggestions/whatever, feel free to ask.

                              <span>I used to use ranger (https://github.com/ranger/ranger) as my terminal file manager for a long time. But the app is really slow. I always thought this is just how terminal apps are like, and not much can be done about that. Ranger is written in Python.
 Then I discovered yazi (https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) which is similar to ranger but it&#x27;s blazing fast and snappy. It&#x27;s written in Rust.
 The functionality of these apps is pretty similar, but the snappyness of yazi yet again reminds me how fast and rock solid Rust programs could be. I just don&#x27;t understand why that&#x27;s the case though—it&#x27;s not like these apps do heavy number crunching or systems programming; they essentially provide a skin around terminal utilities such as ls and cd. Why is yazi so so faster then?

 But I&#x27;m not very strong in DSA. I got 2 month vacation from my college. I want to advance my DSA skills. From beginning I did DSA in C++.
 Last week I tried doing it in Golang. But I don&#x27;t like doing it in golang.
 Should I try it in Rust? Or should I continue in C++?

                              <span>The dbg! macro is awesome, but I almost always use println! instead. I lose inline convenience and the automatic label, but I just can&#x27;t stand pretty printing.
 When I&#x27;m trying to print the context of some execution, I&#x27;m usually expecting a ton of repetitive text. I find this way easier to read when parallelized; just painless to pattern match, scan over, and read across dimensions. The patterns are automatically provided to you, they&#x27;re just there.
 What I want is this:
 [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [7, 10] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [7, 1] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [7, 2] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [7, 3] [src\comb.rs:1260:3] count &#x3D; [7, 0] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [7, 4] // .. 
 versus
 [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [ 7, 10, ] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [ 7, 1, ] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [ 7, 2, ] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [ 7, 3, ] [src\comb.rs:1260:3] count &#x3D; [ 7, 0, ] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [ 7, 4, ] // .. 
 This is actual dbg! output from my program, which also demonstrates how pretty printing can even be unnecessarily confusing. The lines [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count and [src\comb.rs:1260:3] count are very similar, but in the single-line example it&#x27;s much easier to spot the odd one out.
 I can copy-paste the source code into my own macro, but for a debug tool that I&#x27;d wanna use everywhere and anywhere it&#x27;s just not the same. Is there an environment variable or some way to disable pretty printing everywhere? I&#x27;ve searched, but found none.
 Either way, curious to hear your thoughts on pretty printing for debug output.
 Your dearest friend,
 Yokin

 We build an error handling solution with stack trace for large Rust projects like GreptimeDB. In practices, it display errors like:
 Failed to handle protocol 0: Failed to handle incoming content, query: blabla, at src/protocol/handler.rs:89:22 1: Failed to reading next message at queue 5 of 10, at src/protocol/loop.rs:254:14 2: Failed to decode &#x60;01010001001010001&#x60; to ProtocolHeader, at src/protocol/codec.rs:90:14 3: serde_json(invalid character at position 1) 
 Previously, errors in Rust mainly report the root cause, but it lacks a lot of context with which developers can debug the error. Moreover, std Backtrace brings a lot of unrelated intermediate stacks and increases a significant runtime overhead.
 Our solution is built upon snafu, which is like a combination of thiserror and anyhow, with less than 1% runtime overhead and binary size.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m new to Go, and was surprised how much boiler plate code was required to use (I guess technically implement) a heap in Go when compared to say Java or C++. I&#x27;m trying to understand why this is the case.
 I understand that the sort interface needs to be implemented along with Push and Pop. From my newbie POV it seems that the reason why other languages only require a comparator is because priority queue&#x27;s in Java and C++ are able to provide a concrete heap implementation through generics? So is this a vestige of pre-generics Go?
 I&#x27;d appreciate any discussion as to why this was the choice taken, as I&#x27;m hoping to get a better understanding of Go and become more gopher :).

                              <span>Hi everyone! Recently, my workplace stopped paying for JetBrains licenses, so all Go developers have to switch to Visual Studio Code. Our company doesn&#x27;t allow us to use personal licenses either. I&#x27;m looking for people who have switched from GoLand to VS Code; if they have any tips or extensions to make the transition easier, please share them.

 Why does b escape to the heap? It can be stack allocated since its function scoped right?

 With the amount of hate HP printers rightfully get for their restrictions (bricking printers without a subscription or using 3rd part ink), you would think someone would have found a work around. Have I been looking in the wrong places, or am I just being an armchair redditor right now?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 Just a basic question I want to ask. Recently, I&#x27;ve been doing some code reviews and playing CTFs, all of which I&#x27;m doing on the provided machine over an SSH connection. However, whatever I do on the provided SSH server is getting logged in a file and somewhere else as well, but I don&#x27;t have access to read or write these logs. Now, every single command that I run on their machine gets logged, and there&#x27;s a challenge where I have to initiate an SSH connection or run any UNIX commands without them being logged into that file.
 Is there any way to do this? Also, I was thinking if I write a Python or Bash script and then perform tasks on the provided machine, maybe only the execution of the script with its name will get logged.
 Does anyone have an idea or suggestions on HOWTO do this?

                              <span>I gathered this data from the two most comprehensive sources out there: TrueUp.io and Layoffs.fyi.
 Here&#x27;s a quick summary of the findings below:
  
There are 29.5% more tech job openings today than the low hit last March, and this positive trend has been largely steady
 The YoY number of average daily tech layoffs has declined by roughly 20%
  
Notes on the stats below: the difference in total numbers is due to TrueUp&#x27;s much larger dataset (it tracks more startups &amp; non-US markets). Both still show a nice improvement --- the decline in average daily layoffs is around 24% on TrueUp and 14% on Layoffs.fyi. Also, I rounded the figures to the nearest 1K.
 TrueUp.io
  
There are 211K open tech jobs today; there were 163K at the March 3, 2023 low. That said, the peak was 478K in April &#x27;22
 In 2023, there were 429K people laid off by 2,001 tech companies (an average of 1,175 people/day)
 So far in 2024, there have been 118K people laid off by 540 tech companies (an average of 891 people/day)
  
Layoffs.fyi
  
In 2023, there were 263K people laid off by 1,191 tech companies (an average of 721 people/day)
 So far in 2024, there have been 81K people laid off by 287 tech companies (an average of 619 people/day)
  
If it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s improving, hang in there. No market moves in a straight line...but at least the bumpy ride appears to be on the right track!

                              <span>Any tips how to get in to Papa Johns? I’ve heard only good things about Prapy. It’s my dream job, I’ve been prepping leetcode hard and even doing in person reconnaissance of some locations to get a feel for the work culture (i was pretending to buy pizza).
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello all. I&#x27;ve been working as an embedded software engineer for about 8 years and wanted to move my career in the direction of backend and cloud. I was just rejected from a role after completing a take home assignment writing a simple RESTful API for a microservice managing one resource. The position was a Golang position (which I admittedly have no experience in) but the assignment did not have to be written in Go. I decided to write it in Go anyways because:
  
I would need to learn the language if I were to be hired for the position anyways.
 
It would be nice to learn a new language and it&#x27;s ecosystem even if I were to be rejected.
 
 So I poured my heart into learning Go and some select frameworks. I honestly thought I did well enough on the assignment considering it&#x27;s my first real attempt to write something in Go that isn&#x27;t absolutely trivial. I was not given any feedback for where I went wrong so I&#x27;m left in the dark here. Can any of you give me some feedback on my code? Really appreciate the time.

 EDIT:
 I&#x27;d like to thank you all for the enormous feedback. It&#x27;s heavily appreciated. Never thought that I would have received so much in such a short time frame. I think I have a clear understanding of where the weak points lie now for future projects. I&#x27;ll definitely be incorporating some of the suggestions in future projects. Perhaps even make changes to this one for the sake of completeness.
 As for the job, while I am a bit disappointed after sinking in hours into this project, I&#x27;m just treating it as part of the learning experience.
 I probably won&#x27;t have the time to respond to any new comments. But I&#x27;d like to thank everybody again.
 Golang is a lovely language. :)

                              <span>Hi. I am the author of the expriemental programming language specification 3Rus. I have released 0.1 of the specification. This is 10x simpler than C++ as this removes 7 keywords consteval, constinit, constexpr, concept, requires, template and typename. This introduces one new keyword _. Besides few others are introduced but those could be considered as same as older ones e.g. if1 and for1 have similar semantics to if and for. Besides, this removes macros and has reflection. Libraries like CTRE and serialization of any kind would become tremendously easy to achieve in this.
 But I have a feeling that semantics are incorrect and it is not what it appears to be. Please help me find out my mistake.
 This is an incomplete specification and only discusses language semantics from generics and reflection perspective and does not consider other aspects of the programming language.
 Please share your thoughts. https://github.com/HassanSajjad-302/3Rus/tree/0.1

                              <span>So I&#x27;m thinking of learning a C++ GUI framework now and I wanted to hear people&#x27;s opinions on which is best. People say QT is great because it&#x27;s very fast and has lots of features, but the licensing model makes me a bit uneasy. If I had to some day, how much would I be able to do with just LGPL components?
 GTK is cross platform, but it seems native look is not a priority for them. This leads to strange inconsistencies in different UIs which might confuse users. Is GTK still the best option for performance reasons? Or does QT have better performance too?
 Finally there&#x27;s wxWidgets. They compile to native toolkits on every platform, so it&#x27;s probably the best for native look and feel. But is there a performance overhead because of the bindings and platform specific stuff?
 What does everyone think?
 Edit: I thought of another potential advantage of GTK: It has Rust bindings. I don&#x27;t think any of the others do.

                              <span>I work on a shared library. I implemented class and struct like this: 
 namespace cpp_practicing { struct ImageSample { cv::Mat descriptors; }; class PoseEstimator { // some methods ... private: cv::Mat query_image; }; } 
 I import OpenCV headers in my header file:
 #include  #include  #include  
 My CMakeLists.txt is following:
 project(camera_pose_estimation_lib) set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS &quot;${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -Werror -Wextra -O2 -lopencv_imgproc&quot;) # OpenCV find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED) set(OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE &quot;Enable non-free algorithms&quot; ON) INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS}) # Link Conan ... include_directories(${CONAN_INCLUDE_DIRS} &quot;include&quot;) # add source files file(GLOB_RECURSE SOURCES &quot;src/*.cpp&quot;) add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} SHARED ${SOURCES}) target_link_libraries( ${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${OpenCV_LIBS} ${Boost_LIBRARIES}) ... # add tests add_subdirectory(test) 
 Structure of project:
 ├── CMakeLists.txt ├── conanfile.py ├── include │ └── PoseEstimator.h ├── src │ └── PoseEstimator.cpp └── test ├── CMakeLists.txt └── LibraryTest.cpp 
 When I compile I get following error
 /usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/library_test.dir/LibraryTest.cpp.o: undefined reference to symbol &#x27;_ZN2cv3MatD1Ev&#x27; /usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libopencv_core.so.409: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status 
 If I comment out line with field query_image in class PoseEstimator everything compiles without errors.
 What can be the problem here?

                              <span>Although I don&#x27;t like to do it, sometimes I need to use friend declarations to give private access to external classes/functions. Whenever I do, those external entities only need access to 1 or 2 members of the private class. But, giving friendship opens up the entire insides to the friends. So, it can become difficult to understand which privates get used externally, without inspecting the friends. To try to keep things sane, I segregate those members to their own private section. Best I can do is put comments to say they are used externally.
 private: // These are used by friends Foo mBar; Some Function(); private: //... Other private sections are not used by friends. 
 I wish C++ supported a &#x27;friend:&#x27; access specifier in classes, similar to public/protected/private.
 friend: Foo mBar; Some Function(); private: // ... 
 If a class has a &#x27;friend:&#x27; section, then those members are consider private, and they can be accessed by friend classes/functions. If such a section is present, the friend classes/functions are not allowed to access other private sections.
 It would be nice to have limited friendship.

                              <span>Hey all,
 Code smells are driving me up a wall in our CI pipeline. Can anyone explain to me why the following is good practice? I got this smell from sonarqube.
 &quot;Avoid explicitly specifying the template arguments by relying on the class template argument deduction.&quot;
 While I understand you don&#x27;t have to specify the template in c++17, in what world is this bad practice? This seems insanely pedantic to me for no good reason, but maybe I am missing something?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been working with C++ professionally for about a decade, but I&#x27;ve been sticking to knowing as much as I need to in order to write correct and readable code. I&#x27;m transferring to a team whose mission is basically: be C++ experts for the rest of the organization. So now I need to know why and how I&#x27;m doing what I&#x27;m doing.
 What would be the most efficient way to fill in my knowledge gaps? I have gaps in more simple things like the nuances of move semantics, and on the other side of the spectrum I&#x27;m pretty unaware of more advanced techniques like metaprogramming beyond the simplest use case. I also need to build a better intuition of how a certain line of code would exactly translate to machine instructions, and fold that intuition into how I write code.
 I&#x27;ve been watching some cppcon videos to start, and I think the next step might be to reread all of the basic C++ books to make sure I fill in all of the more basic unknowns.

                              <span>I recently came across this neat ErrorOr pattern, while looking through SerenityOS, which works like this:
 ErrorOr GetFoo() { return Foo{}; } auto foo &#x3D; TRY( GetFoo() ); 
 The ErrorOr is simply a wrapper around their own variant type (exactly like std::variant as far as i can tell) with is_error, release_error, release_valuefunctions as alternatives to std::holds_variant, and std::get.
 The only thing that im not a big fan of is the way that the TRY macro is implemented (simplified):
 #define TRY(expr)\ ({\ auto&amp;&amp; tmp &#x3D; (expr);\ if(tmp.is_error())\ return tmp.release_error();\ tmp.release_value()\ }) 
 which only works because of GCC statement expressions (and apparently also works on clang but definitely not on msvc)
 I was wondering if anybody knew of a standard compliant way to implement this maco? Or a msvc equivalent implementation that i could just switch over to when compiling on msvc?

                              <span>I get when to use constexpr for variables. The question arises for constexpr functions: We can mark a function to be constexpr even though we dont know the parameters at compile time, what&#x27;s the point? If we know the parameters and we want to force the evaluation at compile time consteval can just be used

                              <span>So I am a bit confused. I thought you could never reference something below, only above. And when I write a struct underneath my main but try to use it in main then the code fails as expected. 
 However, if we take the following example:
 class some_class { public: void print_hello() { print_out(&quot;Hello&quot;); } private: void print_out(std::string s) { std::cout &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; std::endl; } }; 
 This works, and I am so confused. I can write some_class{}.print_hello(); and it will write out &quot;Hello&quot;, but I thought this was not allowed because print_hello() is trying (successfully) to use a function declared below it. 
 Could someone help me understand when and why something must be declared before it can be used?

                              <span>I have been working with a pretty ancient windows desktop application whose initial release date predates me. Its development team recently wrapped some of its functionality as an unmanaged dll for us so that we can incorporate it into our aspnet based microservice application. Currently we are using .net&#x27;s foreign function interface (PInvoke) to call the library, however it is a bit fragile and we have to meet a few odd requirements like using a thread with a non-standard max stack size.
 I am thinking maybe I should wrap the api calls in a separate program (probably written in c++) to execute c++ calls that I will run in a separate process and use ipc to communicate. This will probably be a bit more robust as I can recover from process crashes and do not need to implement a producer/consumer queue with a separate thread etc. to schedule api calls. However I also feel like I am overcomplicating things. Did any of you had to deal with a similar problem? If so, got any recommendations?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with designing an API in C++20 for an internal project and stumbled upon what seems like a fresh approach to handling event callbacks. I&#x27;m excited about it but unsure if it&#x27;s a well-known technique. I&#x27;d love to get your thoughts and insights on it.
 The Challenge:
 Imagine you have a function Process() that needs to keep others in the loop by firing events like Started, Stopped, and Error during its execution.
 Approach 1: Classic Runtime Interface
 In traditional C++ style, you might set up an interface like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;cpp struct IObserver { virtual void OnStarted() &#x3D; 0; virtual void OnStopped() &#x3D; 0; virtual void OnError(std::string const&amp; error) &#x3D; 0; };
 void Process(IObserver&amp; observer) { observer.OnStarted(); if (something_went_wrong) { observer.O…</span>

                              <span>I recently had a very disappointing and disrespectful experience during the recruitment process with Current (FinTech company). 
 I was assigned a medium level take-home assessment. The recruiter had mentioned that I had a week to work on it, and to email him if I had any questions or concerns on it.
 The take home assessment required a lot of time and effort, but I was able to complete it. It took me about a week to complete. 
 HOWEVER,
 I found myself reaching out to the recruiter to only get completely ghosted from the recruiter.
 The only acknowledgment I received was an impersonal, automated rejection email that offered no personal communication or constructive feedback.
 The best part: I also found out through the submission platform that my work had not even been reviewed! 
 What&#x27;s the point of asking candidates to dedicate effort to a take-home task if it&#x27;s going to be IGNORED??? Super disrespectful and unprofessional to request detailed work from candidates and then disregard it entirely.
 I urge potential candidates to be very cautious. Current&#x27;s hiring approach demonstrates not only a lack of professionalism but also a disregard for basic respect and decency. 
 This experience highlighted a profound disrespect and unprofessionalism that prospective applicants should seriously consider before applying!

                              <span>Last year, I joined a company that seemed too laid-back. Despite good pay, I have little responsibility and have to share simplest of tasks with other developers, which creates a lot of overhead for &quot;collaboration.&quot; My coworkers often take long lunch breaks or disappear during the day, leaving me blocked.
 Unsurprisingly even minor projects take ages to complete, with many people involved. Now the company is struggling with revenue and talking about running out of funding. Meanwhile, we have well-funded competitors that are executing much more effectively
 I&#x27;m not sure what to do. The job market is f&#x27;ed, and I don&#x27;t want to go through the grind again. Talking to the tech leadership would likely either be ignored or get me fired, as they are the ones who set up this enrivonment in the first place and don&#x27;t see the situation the same way I do.
 What would you do if you were in my shoes?

Schedule A occupations are pre-certified and thus employers do NOT have to prove that they first sought American workers for a green card job. This comes on the heels of massive layoffs from the very people pushing this rule change.
 From Tech Target:
  
&quot;The proposed exemption could be applied to a broad range of tech occupations including, notably, software engineering -- which represents about 1.8 million U.S. positions, according to U.S. labor statistics data -- and would allow companies to bypass some labor market tests if there&#x27;s a demonstrated shortage of U.S. workers in an occupation.&quot;

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know why, but for some reason I have to explain to everyone that higher living expenses don&#x27;t negate the benefit of a higher wage. Double the income with double the expenses also doubles the savings.
 Your take home pay is basically &#x3D; (Income - Expenses)
 30,000 &#x3D; 50,000-20,000 for a good mid-west job (really rough, not realistic)
 double both living and income and we get
 60,000 &#x3D; 100,000-40,000 for a good city job (really rough, not realistic just an example)
 This is something people in companies also don&#x27;t know, I think we just accept some statements as truth and leave it at that, but it&#x27;s not true and just requires basic math. If both of the only variables go up, then any result of that variable will also shoot up, so THP &#x3D; (Income-Expenses) is the same as 2THP &#x3D; 2(Income-Expenses).

                              <span>Data suggests employees are feeling trapped and ready to quit. 85% of professionals are looking for a new job. The current regime of low attrition is ready to break as job satisfaction ticks down. Employers seem convinced they&#x27;re back in control of the market however they&#x27;re soon going to be faced with massive turnover and the costs that go with that. As this turnover ramps up employers will be once again competing with each other to attract and retain talent. The pendulum swung too hard and too fast back to employers and now it&#x27;s likely to swing back just as hard. The volatility in the job market is set to continue for years to come and this is a real opportunity for those unphased by it.
 My question for many of you is: Are you looking for a job and why? Planning to hold on for dear life? Are you burnt out?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 After having released my game as a solo-dev about a month ago, I thought it would be a good idea to share my data and experiences as an interesting reference for your own projects.
 Here is the raw data:
  
Lifetime Steam revenue (gross): $73,684
 Lifetime Steam revenue (net): $61,188
 Lifetime Steam units: 5,626
 Lifetime units returned: -457 (8.1% of Steam units)
 Median time played: 6 hours 25 minutes
 Current Wishlists: 19,219
  
My game: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2026000/Our_Adventurer_Guild/
 Background:
 Unlike many people here, making a game was not my dream job, nor have I ever thought about making a game when I was a kid. I like gaming and do it a lot, but my true passion was more about drawing and creating stories. I always wanted to maybe draw a web comic…</span>

                              <span>We have been working on our game for about 5 months. And no one outside of us has played the game. Just recently we started to reach out to people and looking for playtesters. Finally, we got our first one. A YouTube content creator offered to play our game on twitter.
 Anyway
 As he played, he ran into a lot bugs. While annoying, ( everyone wants their game to be as polished as possible when someone plays it) this wasn’t really the surprising part, instead it was immensely helpful. I wrote them all down to be fixed. Some bugs he found I didn’t even know about, nor would I have been able to find them as breaking your own game is harder than you first think.
 Here&#x27;s the thing that surprised me. It was when he started asking things like
 &quot;How?&quot;
 &quot;What am I supposed to do right now?&quot;

 Is there a relatively inexpensive way of creating/obtaining art assets that doesn&#x27;t involve AI? I have enough vision to check whether the art is of quality and within the realm of what I want - I don&#x27;t have enough to draw, not at speed.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m new to programming and I have an existential question about C. One of the exercises I have to solve now in my course is to create a function that will join two strings into a new one, and I&#x27;m allowed to use malloc. That&#x27;s all the specification I have:
 prototype: char *join_strings(char const *string1, char const *string2) return NULL if allocation fails 
 It doesn&#x27;t say anything about handling a NULL pointer, It&#x27;s up to me to decide and justify my choice. So I could either return NULL if any of the parameters is NULL, or I could return a pointer to a copy of the non-null parameter.
 What would an experienced C programmer do instinctively by default?
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m calling the macro A with an empty __VA_ARGS__, is this allowed? it works on all compilers I tested (gcc, clang, msvc, tcc). But is it standard?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got bored and would like to ask everyone on exact name of Operating System and Organisation you would like to see in the future and maybe what you would expect when interacting with it.
 This is my take: https://opencollective.com/public-domain-laboratories/projects/pdl_operating_system
 It&#x27;s not functional, it barely have anything. What I dislike about the name is how it sounds and looks as an acronym: pdlos
 For me acronym is important, as it is shortest way to refer to it on search engines and in a more social settings.

 8YoE here, got a new manager. A couple of weeks ago a bug comes up, i fix it, he gives me shit for it, doesn&#x27;t allow the fix to go ahead, and says i got it wrong.
 He then proceeds to make a deal out of it, intentionally says in the standup, in front of his own boss too how &quot;he was let down, and that feature is broken still&quot;.
 Literally less than 2 weeks later, he comes back and asks me to apply the same fix i did initially, because &quot;he evaluated the situation, and found it best&quot;.
 He made me look like i have no idea what I&#x27;m doing in front of the team and management.
 Dude also micromanages, with things like &quot;i sometimes look at branches, so don&#x27;t push any code you haven&#x27;t personally tested, even if it&#x27;s to a branch you&#x27;re not intending on opening a PR for&quot; lol.
 A few days ago we had a 1:1, and unprovoked he tells me &quot;you need to know something, I&#x27;m the boss! I make decisions, it&#x27;s my team&quot; this wasn&#x27;t in response to something i said. No, he literally just stated it

                              <span>Let me explain.
 So I observed a behavior in development teams. I’m not sure if this has an established name. When teams have changing managers, they might end up having to explain basic things about their work to the newcoming manager. The newcoming manager might not actually listen or understand what’s actually going on in the team, and just tries to adapt a methodology they find matching, or what they bring from their previous experience, without assessing how information actually flows, what are the actual dependencies, constraints, etc.
 Developers will easily just get tired of explaining basic things over and over again. And this is where the attitude kicks in:

                              <span>We&#x27;re trying to set up a development environment for our microservice stack and we&#x27;re trying to get it as close to production as possible in terms of what data is available, what kinds of requests go through it, etc.
 I&#x27;ve heard of people doing things like &quot;snapshotting prod database to replicate it in dev/staging&quot; to get the database similar. I&#x27;ve also seen things like &quot;duplicate a function inside of an API call in code, and log the results so you can check the logs to see how things work&quot;...which I guess is kind of a way to &quot;dev with production traffic&quot; but you have to do some sloppy work using production logging to see what happens.
 In the classic dev env -&gt; test env -&gt; staging env -&gt; prod env set up, I&#x27;m curious how people here make sure the pre-production environments are similar to prod? How close are you able to get?

                              <span>I’ve been programming for a while, but I’m new to devops and deploying a full stack app. Before, I would just spin up a DigitalOcean server, manually pull my code, and just run it using something like PM2. I’m looking for something a little cleaner this time around with CI/CD practices. But, I’m lost on what service to use. There’s so many between Vercel, Render, AWS, Firebase, and more. I have a few services to run, so I’m looking for advice.
 There’s the app built in Expo, which interacts with an API. The API schedules jobs using BullMQ (Which uses Redis), and there’s a lightweight worker that fulfills those jobs (The worker just sends some HTTP requests and interacts with a Postgres database).
 So I have to host - Redis - Postgres (Hosted by Supabase at the moment) - An API (Node) - Worker (Node)
 I was thinking the worker would be a good fit for a serverless function, though I’ve never worked with them. If I go with AWS, Redis and BullMQ can be replaced with SQS, but AWS is also pretty complex for what I feel is a relatively simple app.
 What would you do? Should I just bite the bullet and finally learn AWS properly?

                              <span>I’m part of a team, but frankly I’m the one doing the majority of the work. 
 software engineers and managers just come up to me whenever they have issues because they know my team don’t know how to do anything. 
 It comes to a point where even if I go on vacation for a week or so, they’ll halt some processes until I return because they don’t want my team to break stuff.
 Even when I implement stuff and guide them through it so they follow best practices, they mess things up. They just send their PRs to each other and approve blindly.
 This is because the corporate has a new policy of relocating most r&amp;d to a different region to save money. That region, is not qualified for the job to say the least. 
 I don’t want to fight, really. But I just can’t compromise on stuff like that, they keep damaging my work. And I’ve tried so much to align them with basic standards..
 I can’t revoke my own team’s permissions, I have no one to complain to since they relocated my management to the same region as these employees so it’s a cabal. 
 Is the only choice left is to bail ?

                              <span>What do you use at your workplace? If anyone here who works/worked at Microsoft, what do you guys use? 
 I want to move my team away from Azure DevOps to GitHub. Want to understand if anyone has been on this journey and your learnings from it. 
 Appreciate any inputs. Thanks. 
 Edit: Reasons for considering move to GHE: 1. CoPilot capabilities 2. Better native SaaS integration 3. Moving away from a potential near future legacy platform

                              <span>I hope this is the right place to post this haha! I’ve been working on a project regarding the ILOVEYOU worm, and I am stumped as to why it overwrote files? If I understand correctly, the end goal of the worm was to propagate the Borak trojan to steal passwords. If this is true, though, I fail to see why it overwrote unrelated files with copies of itself?

                              <span>I’m working on this project for my ethical hacking course to where I need to gain access to a Windows Server 2012 R2 VM with a Kali Linux VM without knowing the username or password to the Windows VM. I’ve got the host name to the system but the next question on the project is “What is the login username and password for the VM?” I’ve literally tried everything I know from nmap to msfconsole to try using ms17-010 eternalblue but it just says the system is not vulnerable. I’m at a loss can someone teach me…

                              <span>hii, im doing the extension for a school project. im trying to scan from the file into 2 strings (one contains just the name, to check if its the name of the guy im getting rid of) and then the rest of the line in a function.
 i dont know what more to say, because i have no idea why its not working. for the sake of this reddit post, ive gotten rid of the if/else which gets rid of the targeted name because that works, its just the scanning which is a problem.
 i havent tried formatting code before so if i do it wrong lmk
 int dataDel(char name[]){ FILE *monarchs&#x3D;fopen(&quot;MonarchsData.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;); if(fileCheck(monarchs)&#x3D;&#x3D;1) //error for file not opening return 1; else{ //scan from file and delete the target mwahaha char liner[1000][20]; char nameLiner[500][20]; int i&#x3D;0; while(fscanf(monarchs, &quot;%s&quot;, nameLiner[i])!&#x3D;EOF){ fscanf(monarchs, &quot;%[^\n]&quot;, &amp;liner[i]); //scans everything that isnt newline i++; } fclose(monarchs); monarchs&#x3D;fopen(&quot;MonarchsData.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;); //rewriting the file without the name line for(int j&#x3D;0; j&lt;i; j++){ fprintf(monarchs, &quot;%s %s\n&quot;, nameLiner[j], liner[j]); //printing back to the file } fclose(monarchs); } //end of else return 0; }

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently pursuing a Master&#x27;s in Computer Science and expect to graduate in the next six months. My background includes an undergrad degree in Computer Science and several software engineering internships. I have a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming using Java, as well as web and mobile development with technologies like React and Node.js.
 While I consider myself proficient in developing products, I’m aware that the rise of workflow automation might impact the relevance of some skills I currently possess. To stay ahead, I’m planning to deepen my expertise in C programming and explore branches such as embedded programming and advanced uses of C/C++.
 I have a decent handle on solving LeetCode problems and a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms. However, I aim to achieve a deeper understanding of programming and want to have skills that can make me a better developer and a valuable employee.
 I’m here to ask for advice and pointers from those with more experience. Should I focus on C/C++ for embedded systems, or are there other areas within systems programming I should consider? I am also taking a Computer Systems course on the side. I appreciate all the feedbacks I can get - roadmaps, youtube series, project ideas, literally anything. Thank you. 
 PS - I am also trying to explore if I really like programming in C in long-term so I want to go in-depth. I can put in work but I am not sure about the path to follow.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m trying to follow the Vulkan tutorial, yet I&#x27;m coding in C instead of C++. Additionally, I&#x27;m coding in Visual Studio with the horrible MSVC compiler which doesnt allow me to simply write &#x60;VkPhysicalDevice devices[deviceCount]&#x60;.
 No problem, I thought, I&#x27;m just going to use malloc.
 Yes problem. For whatever reason, this fails spectacularily (Access violation writing location ...), no clue why.
 uint32_t deviceCount &#x3D; 0;
 vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(*instance, &amp;deviceCount, 0);
 VkPhysicalDevice *devices &#x3D; malloc(sizeof(VkPhysicalDevice) * deviceCount);
 vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(*instance, &amp;deviceCount, devices);
 Whereas this works fine.
 uint32_t deviceCount &#x3D; 0;
 vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(*instance, &amp;deviceCount, 0);
 VkPhysicalDevice devices[2]; // in my case deviceCount is 2
 vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(*instance, &amp;deviceCount, devices);
 From my understanding, there shouldn&#x27;t be a difference as arrays are basically pointers to memory space anyways... Can anyone explain?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I always used Valgrind to detect memory errors and it works fine IMO but it&#x27;s a bit slow, hence,
 i decided to try Gcc Sanitizer which seems to be more fast but there are some cases for which it doesn&#x27;t detect memory leaks.
 For example, I had a global variable in my program which was heap allocated and gcc sanitizer can&#x27;t detected it.
 For other cases instead, it works.
 Had anyone a similar experience ?
 Best regards.

                              <span>Yesterday I came up with this error-handling pattern in C:
 The return type of a function is a struct with an &quot;is_error&quot; bool, and a union of the error, or the data you want to return. The error can contain an enum so the specific errors can be resolved in code, and a char* to a descriptive error message for easier debugging. What do you think? Do you use something similar, or have a better way of handling errors?
 Here&#x27;s some example code which can be run in godbolt:
 ​
 #include  #include  #include  #define _STRINGIFY(x) #x #define STRINGIFY(x) _STRINGIFY(x) #define ERROR_STRING(string_literal) &quot;ERROR in &quot;__FILE__ &quot; line #&quot; STRINGIFY(__LINE__) string_literal typedef struct { bool is_error; union { struct { enum {MakeEggs_error_TemperatureLow, MakeEggs_error_…</span>

                              <span>For some context, I am very new to Linux and am trying to make a program that moves any files that I &quot;delete&quot; to a &quot;recycle folder&quot; rather than just deleting it using rm (the idea was to use an alias for this program in place of rm).
 This being said, I have successfully set the program to move any files I specify, however, folders do not work as expected (neither does recursion). What linux calls can I use to move folders (recursively)?

                              <span>I am reading the book &quot;The C Programming Language,&quot; an amazing book by the way. In the last chapter about the Unix system, there is a part about building the fopen function with system calls. In this, we use some kind of internal flags, for example, _READ instead of O_RDONLY. In the implementation, it uses both the POSIX and the internal flags. As I understand it, it uses both because in order to detect if some FILE has write privileges, for example, you can intersect bits, and if the intersection is different than 0, it has the privilege. However, this breaks when using O_RDONLY because it has the value 0, so it is not possible to detect if a combination of flags has the O_RDONLY flag with this aproach.
 So my question is, why does POSIX start with 0 instead of 1 and shift the rest by 2*n?
 (Maybe the answer is obvious, but I don&#x27;t see it.)

                              <span>This is actually insane how many people are doing this , so after I posted on /INAT in like 10mins I got Two people on discord trying to scam me to pay 200$ -&gt; 250$ for Ai generated art , btw they take zero effort coming up with the images as a portfolio each image with completely different art style and they dont even rename the image they leave the 11efa8adf4d35f69d60261cf676c8a2a type name , and you can just reverse search with google image and they will 90% come up in pinterest (some of them don&#x27;t because they are Ai generated) .
 (a bit of contest they showed me your usual Ai generated looking art, then I asked them for pixl art and they literally just Googled PIXL ART and just sent me the first images that came up ,and one of the even sent me image with the Ai logo on it and he deleted it too fast so I couldn&#x27;t take screenshot )
 So until now it&#x27;s okay but when I started confronting them ,they started to deny and when I pulled up the screenshots of reverse searching they told me that ,no we made them long time ago and when keept denying it .
 eventually they admitted that they used images from pinterest for the pixl art but not the other &quot;Ai generated looking art &quot; and i kept pushing them until they stopped talking to me ,and one of them literally said &quot;If you use my artwork elsewhere, I will report you.&quot; and asked me if I am algerian for some reason which I am , maybe he thought he would scare me or something like that ,And they went to my reddit post and Down voted it to try hurting me or whatever xd .
 Conclusion :
 Those scamers have insane resilience.
 But actually on the serious note, always look out for new made Discord acounts and basically all Ai generated looking art , and of course always reverse search them to make sure

                              <span>Almost 11k layoffs this year alone.
 I&#x27;m a frontend engineer / programmer with 10 years&#x27; experience in Unity, 8+ shipped games, and a few years of unreal 3-5 experience from side projects over the years.
 I was laid off twice last year, and I have not gotten as much as an interview in 6 months of applying since. I can&#x27;t keep going like this, hoping something is going to work out.
 I paid (finally in full) $150,000 for a Software Engineering degree from RIT that did not have 1 class explaining what a server was or teaching us web development (weirdly we had one class Enterprise Architecture class teaching patterns like Join tables with no context for how to write database queries).
 What&#x27;s left of the industry has forced me out. I will never give up gamedev as a hobby, but I need a way to make money. Every software engineering job I can find now is an unrecognizable alphabet soup of technologies, usually requiring senior developers with backend experience.
 What do I do? Where do I start learning to make myself marketable?
 (P.S. giant middle finger to every live service for soaking up every moment and dollar from the players they exploit, driving the success / profitability bar so high that nothing I recognize as a game will have a fair shot of being funded by a major publisher ever again)

 Why did this become the norm for anti-cheats, and why the user mode anti-cheats are not sufficient? Is it the only way for developers to protect their games?

                              <span>I find these posts really interesting so wanted to throw my own experience into the mix in the shape of a little ‘postmortem’ report after my game’s Steam page went live last week, and what I did to promote it.
 Key stats: 
 Wishlists: 530
 Impressions: 4,287
 Visits: 1,795
 Bot traffic visits: 877
 Steam overall clickthrough rate: 41.9%
 Weekly wishlist chart: https://imgur.com/a/TU7vs3e
 My game is a point and click adventure, so I’m in pretty niche territory, but I’m fairly pleased with the momentum so far.
 Anyway, after working on assets for a little while, I launched my page with the following (notable) week-one activity:

It&#x27;s of course a lot easier to do this when you have a matrix of dimension 2^n, so I could pad this with zeros to make it 128x128 instead. Is there a way to do this simply? What sides does the padding with zeros go on? 
 Also, I am currently using a vector of vectors to store my matrix essentially. Does this make a difference to how I would go about this?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m making a header with a bunch of stuff to make my life easier at school, I wanted to call srand there too, before main function, but it needs a constructor to initialize. I looked inside the cstdlib code and some other headers it calls within itself but I can&#x27;t find it. Can anyone help me or tell me if it can be done at least ? Google wasn&#x27;t much help either

                              <span>Hi everyone recently i was learning about async function in cpp and have doubt regarding the same.
 How much thread are created here does this program utilized the number of cores of system or everything happening in the same thread that is main ?
 Please help in understanding what is the advantage of using async here.
 #include #include using namespace std; int square(int x) { return x * x; } int main() { future asyncFunction &#x3D; async(&amp;square, 12); for (int i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; 4; i++) { cout &lt;&lt; square(i) &lt;&lt; endl; } // we are blocket at get call until our result has computed int res &#x3D; asyncFunction.get(); cout &lt;&lt; &quot;result is: &quot; &lt;&lt; res &lt;&lt; endl; return 0; }

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;m working on a CPP application which generate some QML code. My software is a TTRPG CharacterSheet editor, where users can design the charactersheet. There is a UI to design it then you can generate the QML code, and the user may want to do some modifications on the generated code (I need the code to be well-indented).
 I&#x27;m looking for any tips or methods to generate this code and replace placeholders with value.
 Currently, I&#x27;m using QString and arg parameters. But I find this solution complex to maintain and the code is kind of ugly.
 One example: The imageField &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;cpp bool QmlGeneratorVisitor::generateImage(FieldController* item) { if(!item) return false;
 QString text(&quot;%4ImageField {//%1\n&quot; &quot;%5&quot; &quot;%4 source: %2.value\n&quot; &quot;%4 color: \&quot;%3\&quot;\n&quot; + getPageManagement(item, m_indenSpace) + &quot;%4 readOnly: %2.readOnly\n&quot; + generatePosition(item) + &quot;%4}\n&quot;); m_out label()) //%1 .arg(getId(item)) .arg(item-&gt;bgColor().name(QColor::HexArgb)) .arg(m_indenSpace) //%4 .arg(m_isTable ? QStringLiteral(&quot;&quot;) : QStringLiteral(&quot;%1 id: _%2\n&quot;).arg(m_indenSpace).arg(getId(item))); return true; 
 } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; %1 -&gt; name of the field %2 -&gt; id of the field %3 -&gt; background color %4 -&gt; indentation space %5 -&gt; generation of the QML id (based on item id)
 Do you have any solution or tips: could be a way to organize or even some libraries…

                              <span>Basically every language I&#x27;ve worked with so far has been ok with dependency management. You need a library, you install that library, you use it. Sometimes there&#x27;s version conflicts and such, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m talking about here. In Python: pip install; in JS: npm install; in Rust: add it to Cargo.toml; Java: POM File. These are what I worked with, and I know there&#x27;s other ways to do it in each one, but still, it&#x27;s basically &quot;hey, I need to use this&quot; &quot;ok&quot;. But with cpp, every single time I&#x27;ve had to deal with some dependency it&#x27;s been a huge effort to try and relearn cmake, or having to go manually after library files, have compilers screaming at me that it can&#x27;t find something that&#x27;s RIGHT THERE. 
 So, what&#x27;s the deal? Is there something I&#x27;m missing here? I really hope so, please let me know how wrong I am.

 I have open-sourced a part of my database that is a superior replacement for &#x60;std::function&#x60;. It is more performant, easier to understand and much more flexible. It has not been heavily tested yet so bug reports are very welcome! Any other form of contribution as well!

                              <span>The best convention I suppose is the one that is currently being used in the project. But when starting a new project or writing your own hobby code that you want to look professional, and you want to be up to date, which of the following should be done for C++?
  
snake_case vs CamelCase: Seems everyone agrees on CamelCase for naming structs and classes, but for namespaces, functions/methods, and fields/variables I have seen both and am I bit confused as to which is &quot;best&quot; or most &quot;standard.&quot;
 m_variable vs _variable vs variable: a) When implementing member variables of a class, is there a standard for starting with m_, _, or nothing? b) Should a public member start with uppercase a la C# properties? c) Are the answers the same for structs?
 variable_ptr vs variable: When a variable is a pointer, what is the standard to add _ptr to its name, not add _ptr to its name, or do whatever increases readability the most for that specific code snippet?
 g_variable vs variable: When a variable is global for a file, is it standard to add g_ in front of its name?
 get_/set_variable() vs variable(): When implementing getter and setter functions, is it typically better (or more standard) to include &quot;get&quot; and &quot;set&quot; in the function name or to just write out the name? E.g. get_success_count() vs success_count().

                              <span>Guys I work in project which is built for both MSVC and QNX, now we&#x27;re trying to build with Linux gcc (in WSL). 
 But the issue is, I&#x27;m getting many errors w.r.t. std functions, for example std::find in algorithm. The error is getting fixed with inclusion of header files. 
 Strangely it is getting built well in msvc and qnx compilers, without even include. I want to know how this works?.
 This is mainly c/cpp built with cmake.
 Thank you.

                              <span>I was refactoring my asset code in my engine and noticed that objects were randomly being destroyed and I completely blanked on how ownership, references, and non reference/pointer values work which I think is the issue I&#x27;m running into. I have a global struct with a few containers for each asset type and then a load function for each asset type &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; struct Assets { std::map models; std::map textures; std::map shaders; };
 ShaderProgram loadShader(Assets&amp; assets, const std::string&amp; vertexPath, const std::string&amp; fragmentPath); Model loadModel(Assets&amp; assets, const std::string&amp; filePath); Texture loadTexture(Assets&amp; assets, const char* filePath);
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; These functions hash the filepath (which is the new thing I was trying out) to use as a unique id and then if not already loaded loads it and returns the asset. I believe everything is being copied right now so I&#x27;m not working with the original object which causes them to constantly be deleted and not be rendered on screen so to fix this I just need the maps to store a smart pointer and the load functions return a smart pointer?
 For future reference is there a way to remember this sort of stuff for example whenever an object is needed outside the scope should I be working with pointers?

                              <span>I recently started learning Rust and wanted to share my experience to encourage others who might be hesitant about its perceived difficulty. The notion that Rust is a tough language puts people from even trying, including my past self. This is particularly relevant for those who, like me, have primarily worked with GC&#x27;d languages (I&#x27;ve only ever completed one semester course in C++ and never used it professionally).
 For me, the learning curve for Rust wasn&#x27;t as steep as it was for other programming paradigms I&#x27;ve used extensively, such as logic or pure functional programming.

 GCP somehow managed to delete a customers account and all their data. Luckily UniSuper had backups on another provider which let them recover after a week of being offline. 620,000 members and $125 billion in funds so not exactly small fish either.

                              <span>Hi so I&#x27;ve seen a lot of posts discussing similar questions about the best CI/CD but what confuses me is that people a lot of times suggest GitLab CI and GitHub Actions, are they meaning that they should change SCM providers as well? Or are they saying they should create a copy of their repository in GitLab/GitHub and pay the costs of two providers just to use the pipeline? Currently I&#x27;m in a team using Jira and Confluence so I think it makes sense for us to go with BitBucket since code review can easily be done in a way that ties to user stories and it is discounted with our other Atlassian products. Why don&#x27;t more people that use Jira use BitBucket? And what is the best option for a company using Jira? Do we copy our BitBucket repo to GitLab, do we use GitLab and use a Jira integration but still not have our code review be able to be tied to user stories, or do we use a CI/CD manager like Jenkins which most people agree is complex to manage? What are other people doing for this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I am wondering how people here manage the existence of additional environments in addition to production - staging, testing, dev environments.
 In my experience these can be heavy compute cost wise and this can also add up maintenance wise. I&#x27;ve in the past merged a few of these environments to reduce maintenance cost.
 How do you work around this?

 HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;40304549
 Excerpt:
  
Choosing colocation for the infrastructure was the right decision for Ahrefs. Reflecting on the past six years, the data centers with our own servers and network cost us $122 million, a figure that would have ballooned to an astronomical $1.1 billion if we had opted for the cheapest AWS cloud offering. Our powerful on-prem servers enable our developers to focus on enhancing our products for clients, rather than getting caught in a never-ending cycle of trying to optimize cloud costs with little hope of success.

                              <span>After a 20+ year career, I was laid off in the spring of 2023 and spent the next 10 months searching for a new job in what was easily the toughest and most unpleasant experience I&#x27;ve ever had. (Clocked in a total of 95 interviews and over 1200 applications before I finally got an offer.)
 Now, roughly 4 months into the new position, our CEO is stepping down to a different role, and our CFO is leaving altogether. The CFO has been in the position for only 7 months.
 Am I right to be paranoid about the company&#x27;s stability, or am I overreacting?

                              <span>I currently work in a customer facing role with a non-technical PM who manages the projects I work on. This PM consistently schedules last minute meetings and meetings scattered throughout the day, making it extremely difficult to get into flow state and get any actual work done. The PM consistently wants to meet AFTER a meeting with the client so that I can help them understand what happened and fill out their status report since they are not technical and don’t understand what is going on. This happens multiple times a week. Projects are now having to be extended, part of which is because of the fact that my time is consistently being wasted in meetings, or meetings to discuss meetings from earlier. I’ve spoken to my manager about this, and my manager supports me managing my own time. What should I do to set the expectation that I will not use half of my week on meetings that are a waste of time?

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve had to find a new job, and for the first time in my career it&#x27;s looking like I&#x27;m going to be taking a fairly substantial pay cut. And I&#x27;ve been having very mixed feelings about it.
 I&#x27;m based in the UK/europe, so for American readers just replace the numbers in your brain with a higher equivalent, rather than commenting on the actual numbers. Because the numbers aren&#x27;t the point. Just think of &quot;what you personally consider a high salary&quot;.
 My previous job paid very well. I was making more than £100k + decent benefits, which is something like top 1-2% of UK salaries. And in my head this number was a representation of success. Most people don&#x27;t earn that much so I must be more successful than most people. I&#x27;ve never thought of myself as materialistic but I enjoyed feeling that …</span>

                              <span>I am a senior dev at my company and was pulled onto a project to deliver a more complicated requirement. While doing this, I realised the more junior dev had missed a lot of functionality and requirements in his build. So he was taken off the project and I was assigned to do a non-billable rework.
 For context, I am a Salesforce developer and the project is complex integration. The client insisted we use a 3rd party tool and deliver the project using SSIS packages. I was not involved at the start or in the sales cycle so had no opportunity to argue against this. I have no experience using SSIS packages and neither does anyone in our company. This isn&#x27;t a project we should have taken on. 
 I have been working for a couple of weeks to try to save the project but at this point I don&#x27;t think I can do it. I don&#x27;t have enough knowledge on SSIS packages and the 3rd party software the client wants us to use. I have learned a lot about them but at this point, the skills required to deliver are not ones I have and I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to really learn them. 
 Does anyone else have experiences like this? I pride myself on being able to teach myself and adapt so it doesn&#x27;t feel great to admit I&#x27;m not capable.
 UPDATE: There is some really great advice in this thread and it&#x27;s good to know I am not the only one this has happened to. I took some of the advice here on board and had a meeting with my deliver director and PM lead where I explained the problem and gave some solutions rather than a flat out &quot;I can&#x27;t do this&quot;. These included me taking extra time to learn about SSIS, hiring a contractor or restructuring the project into a more manageable phased approach. Now it is up to them to have the difficult conversation with the customer!

                              <span>I&#x27;m from Spain, so salaries here are mostly garbage except in IT and healthcare. Most of my dev life (4 years) I&#x27;ve been paid pretty poorly but I didn&#x27;t care because I was either a junior who was still learning and didn&#x27;t see his own value yet, or I was studying abroad and working part time to afford rent. I didn&#x27;t have anyone depending on me and I could get by with low income.
 However, when I came back to Spain, sitting at ~3 YoE and with a brand new bachelor&#x27;s under my belt, I felt I could go for more since some friends of mine with whom I studied at the start of my career were earning a lot with the same experience as me. So, for my next company I was going to ask for the same salary as them, but doubted myself at the very end and asked for a bit less. I was offered even less and accep…</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone. I have always found emulators to be very fascinating, and a few months ago I finally took the plunge and decided to write an emulator of my own. The dream is to write an emulator for the NES, but I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with low level programming, so I started with Chip-8, since it is pretty much the &quot;Hello, World&quot; of emulators.
 I just pushed the final commit of my project on GitHub. I would very much like some feedback on it. Even nitpicking is welcome. Anything I can use when I eventually start working on an NES emulator.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m planning to start adding audio rendering into my Gameboy emulator and have a few questions:
  
For some background, my emulator assumes that all devices will be clocked every machine cycle (70224 cycles/frame). So, I&#x27;m using that clock to determine when to generate the next audio sample. Is there a better way to do this?
 Currently I generate an entire frame of audio data and then sending that data to SDL when it renders the video frame (~60 audio frames/sec). But I&#x27;m having issues finding a good sample rate that divisible by the machine cycles. I did find 264 machine cycles/audio sample, which gives 266 audio samples/frame -&gt; 15,960 audio samples/sec. But this doesn&#x27;t seem optimal. Any suggestions on how I could improve this?
  
Edit: Fixed units in 1. from cycles/sec -&gt; cycles/frame

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a gameboy emulator and am passing almost all of Blargg&#x27;s CPU tests. The main exceptions are the two instructions involving signed integer values: ADD SP, e8 and LD HL, SP + e8. In particular, I&#x27;m failing the test when e8 is -1, seemingly due to the flags. The values I get look correct to my understanding, so my understanding must be wrong. Can someone correct me?

 My resume( format got a little bit screwed since I anonymized it)
 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FkoQ5xQxubdE5n8-LV-u2X8XxIS1rehGZycyiW-2Fas/edit
 Any idea why I am not getting any call backs. When I applied in 2021, my resume was way worse than this yet I got 5 interviews the first week.

                              <span>Whenever I had an experienced technical project lead, things have been incredible. 
 Whenever I’ve had non-technical managers doing their Agile thing, I’ve HATED my life. 
 Technical leads would jump straight into a problem and either unblock us or understand immediately why things are taking so long or why something can’t be done. They are focused on quality, they care about the software and where it is going. Non-technical managers want things done in X amount of time and you need to explain to them like they’re 5 why it hasn’t been done yet. 
 How am I supposed to respect someone and essentially report to them when they know nothing about technology? 
 These are roles to whip the employees to work harder, slaves overlooking other slaves. They’re there to force devs to give themselves deadlines and burn themselves out. 
 Yes, there are also technical managers who aren’t good managers. Imo you need to be both good at management and good at technology, if you’re good at just one of these, you’re automatically not good enough. Your lack in the other area will show up. The definition of a leader, to me, is someone you look up to, who can do at least everything that you do and more. 
 This industry is a bit of a joke, not surprised that people can’t take us seriously when we call ourselves “engineers”. It seems like everyone who knows how to send an email and takes one course can come in and start managing projects. No wonder this industry is flooded and sinking.

 I added comments, further proof, and multiple examples - but nothing back from Immunefi.
 They are claiming &quot;Out of Scope&quot; - but it&#x27;s clearly in scope from all the documents provided.
 Where do you go from here?

                              <span>Yesterday I got a mail back from a well known MNC about a application security engineer open position. I was really in need of a job and cybersecurity jobs are actually hard to get here ( everyone except MNCs don&#x27;t spend money into cybersecurity, until something goes bad ) . They told me to bring my laptop. and it&#x27;s a face to face interview . I checked the duties of an application security engineer and it was totally different from what I am . I worked as a VAPT for two years .( Not a reputed company) Did it for experience and for free. My question is should I attend the interview . They did an initial screening and sent me the mail. It&#x27;s a face to face interview so I need to be there with my laptop and it&#x27;s 800km from here . Should I attend it . Idk most the things application engineer do at work . I need help in deciding . Anything more you guys needs to know . You can ask me in comments

 Recently found a admin bypass on a large well known brand of router.
 I have gotten permission to disclose the “bug” but am unsure how to.
 Would it look bad doing it on LinkedIn as skills?

                              <span>Had my 1 on 1 with my manager today. We have had an open for another senior engineer on my team, so I was asking about the status of it. For almost a year I&#x27;ve been a part of a leadership program to help get me promoted to lead. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of positive feedback along the way and told that I&#x27;m making great progress. According to my manager, because of some of the work that we have coming up in the near future 1. that senior role that I mentioned got bumped to lead (we already have a lead) and 2. they made a pitch for me but ultimate was denied by my skip because there&#x27;s a &quot;local&quot; candidate in the pipeline.
 All things considered I&#x27;m taking it in stride. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be promoted this soon anyway and this unfortunately lines up with the company direction of moving to more in-office / hybrid. There are a bunch of people that were hired (and still are) remote - seniors / leads / principals / managers / directors - one of whom is my manager. Most people still don&#x27;t go into the office except on rare occasions like vertical get togethers where remote folks fly in too.
 I really enjoy working for the company that I do, so the game plan for now is just to keep kicking butt and make myself undeniable for promo. Looking elsewhere for a lead / staff job has crossed my mind, but I have an agreement with myself that I&#x27;ll wait until 5 years before doing that (currently sitting at 3 and some change at my current level). Moving back to where the company is based out of has also crossed my mind - I used to live there, but moved back to my home state to be closer to family during the pandemic.
 I&#x27;m curious - have y&#x27;all run into similar situations? How have you handled it? Also, I have a 1 on 1 with my skip level in a month who denied my promo. Any tips? They&#x27;re new to me because of a re-org, so it&#x27;ll be the first time we&#x27;ve met. I&#x27;ve known of them for a while.

                              <span>Management asked me and 3 other colleagues to conduct interviews for a senior position, and we planned together how to conduct the interviews. 
 My second interviewee was referred by one of my colleagues, and I conducted this interview with a more senior developer but due to time constraints I was only able to change a couple questions from my list and the candidate mostly did very well on the ones I didn&#x27;t change but failed on the ones I changed. The more senior guy asked him about the same questions he uses to ask, and he did ok except on the different questions. Just after the interview we discussed the candidate, and agreed there were some suspicious bits and &quot;red flags&quot; but he objectively passed so we filled in the form with our appraisal and sent to HR.

                              <span>I have gotten pretty saturated at my current role (50 person startup) and I don&#x27;t see any growth path internally. I have already expressed my concerns to my manager many times in the last 1 year, but these discussions have gone nowhere. 
 I have monthly 1:1 with my manager and everytime he wants to know whether I&#x27;m liking my work. Now so far I have followed a policy of being as transparent as possible at work. So the next time he asks me this, I&#x27;m thinking of telling him that I will be looking for opportunities outside since I can&#x27;t see any opportunities within the company.
 So far, I&#x27;ve had a pretty transparent relationship with my manager (who is also the CTO btw). Do you think telling him that I&#x27;m looking for opportunities outside the company can brutally backfire ? I dont have any offers in hand and I may be at the company for a significant amount of time.

                              <span>For context, I lead a team of 8 people in a large company (more than 10k employees). My manager was out on vacation for 2 weeks and before she returned, I went on vacation for 2 weeks. So there’s an overlap of 1 week where we were both on vacation. Both vacation times were planned a month or two ago. 
 There are a couple of key initiatives for our company that my team is working on, and I’ve notified in an email about who to reach out to in my absence, while copying the respective individuals. My automated out of office response also mentions these individuals.
 My team was merged under her a few months ago and she doesn’t have a lot of understanding of our product/service. 
 She returned this week and has been reaching out to me via text asking me to look at my Teams chat/email and provide updates on various topics which she needs to pass on to her boss and a couple of other key stakeholders. I understand her situation and indulged her the other day, but now this is becoming an every day thing.
 How do I be supportive of her situation while also not rubbing her the wrong way? Given the market situation, I don’t want to be fired for sounding rude when asking them not to bother me during my time off.

                              <span>I am working as a lead. All my team mates are at least 10 years junior to me. They respect me and I am driving this team. I also get approached frequently for technical issues they face. 
 But I find it hard to mix with them like I can with colleagues my age. They also tend to be serious in front of me and rarely invite me for tea breaks or unofficial lunches they plan.
 My personality is not at all dominating. (In appraisal review, I keep getting comments that I should be more assertive.) I am little introvert but I still try to lighten the environment and for a moment we are good but then after few minutes everything goes back to earlier stage.
 My concern is this will slowly cut me off from the team especially in future when they will not need my help in solving technical issues.
 Has anyone faced such issues? Is there anything I can do about this or should I just accept this and not worry about it?
 Edit: I am the lead and not a manager. It&#x27;s not an official position. But I am supposed to lead the team because of domain and product knowledge.

                              <span>just started CPP literally today, always enjoyed coding and found it extremely fascinating. never got my head around it though, didn’t think I would be able to ever comprehend these things. I have started using a website called cplusplus.com, it’s been extremely helpful but It feels like it’s not enough.. I read, implement what I have read, but when I try to do it by myself the knowledge is just not there anymore. any tips?

                              <span>Hello, I need help in converting the Devanagari letter अ to its integer representation. In python, I can easily use the ord() function to convert it to its decimal representation For example:
 ch &#x3D; &#x27;अ&#x27; print(ord(ch)) //Outputs 2309, which is the decimal conversion of its Unicode representation, 0905 
 Also the .encode() function to convert it into its Unicode representation
 ch &#x3D; &#x27;अ&#x27; 
 unicode_rep &#x3D; ch.encode(&#x27;ascii&#x27;, &quot;backslashreplace&quot;) print(unicode_rep) //Outputs b&#x27;\u0905 of type byte
 However, when I try the static_cast function in C++ it throws a warning:
 int main(){ char ch &#x3D; &#x27;अ&#x27;; int i &#x3D; static_cast(ch); cout &lt;&lt; i; 
 }
 The output:
 unicode.cpp:7:15: warning: multi-character character constant [-Wmultichar] 7 | char ch &#x3D; &#x27;αñm; | ^~~ 
 unicode.cpp: In function &#x27;int main()&#x27;: unicode.cpp:7:15: warning: overflow in conversion from &#x27;int&#x27; to &#x27;char&#x27; changes value from &#x27;14722181&#x27; to &#x27;-123&#x27; [-Woverflow]
 -123
 What can I do?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m a scientific programmer. I primarily use Python and FORTRAN. I have to write a code that involves solving a finite difference equation on multidimensional vector array. 
 (1) Defining a multidimensional array: The array is electric field with three components (ex, ey, ez) defined at (Nx, Ny, Nz) grid. Where Nx, Ny and Nz are the number of points along X, Y and Z. So if Nx, Ny, and Nz &#x3D; 10, 9, 8 my array will be [10, 9, 8, 3] shape. 
 Then I have to define gradient along all the three axes and solve some numerical equations which involves matrix multiplications. 
 I have done this in Python and it was straight forward using Numpy Ndarrays. 
 I recently tried porting my code to C++. I realised that defining multidimensional arrays in C++ is not so straightforward. 
 What is the fastest and easiest method to implement such a multidimensional array in c++? 
 Any advice is helpful.

How do I write this correctly?
 Further note: that line is the only one in the method.
 Thank you.

From what I know AES doesn&#x27;t use private/public key pairs so I guess I&#x27;ll send it to the clients encrypted using RSA. Are there any examples using AES with large data?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I wrote a blog post about a small C++ library I recently wrote called raptor. I thought I&#x27;d share it here for anyone interested: https://dma-neves.github.io/dma/raptor.html
 Raptor offers similar performance and capabilities to thrust, but offers a more abstract interface. Raptor provides a set of smart containers (vector, array, vector, scalar) and skeletons (map, reduce, scan, filter, sort) that can be applied over the smart containers. Containers can store the data both on the host (CPU) and device (GPU), and expose a seemingly unified memory address space. Skeletons are executed on the device. Containers are automatically and lazily allocated and synchronized whenever a skeleton is executed.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an engineer, not a real programmer. I took a course in &#x27;high performance computing&#x27; once. The teacher was a mathematician, but he seemed to me very knowledgeable in the area of programming also. He taught us that it was convenient not to name iterators with only one letter. I found this good advice myself, so i usually name iterators &#x27;ix&#x27; instead of &#x27;i&#x27;, and so on. Why have I never seen this convention anywhere else?

                              <span>Even a single line of including a header produces these errors. I&#x27;ve seen nearly the same issue on GitHub and Stack Overflow. I&#x27;m using VS Code with LLVM 18.1.5 and GCC 14.1.0 installed from WinLibs.
 I had a similar problem with only the  header, but after updating GCC, this applies to all standard headers. Is anyone else experiencing the same issue? Is this due to a conflict between GCC and Clang (libstdc++ versus libc++, perhaps)?
 Edit: Apparently, passing &#x60;-D_Float32&#x3D;float&#x60; to clang-tidy supresses those errors.

                              <span>I&#x27;m aware that std::string is preferred over char*, but is it always the case? For example,
 auto str &#x3D; &quot;Hello world&quot;; 
 &quot;str&quot; type will be a char*, unless we explicitly mention that it&#x27;s a std::string. So I&#x27;m bit confused here the use cases and if there&#x27;s any downside (in performance) when using std::string over char* (especially for bytes that are will not be modified later).

                              <span>I&#x27;m a recent grad jobsearching. I&#x27;ve never seen an intro-level CPP role, those usually ask for like 5 years of experience. Intro level roles usually ask for Python or React/Typescript. 
 I do like Python, but I miss the types. As for TS. . . It&#x27;s really not even close as using something like CPP or Java. Writing JS/TS classes feels like weenie hut jr. compared to classes in CPP. 
 I hope to work with CPP eventually but I can tell it&#x27;ll be a while.

 In my member functions, some of them return type &#x27;Vector&#x27;. However, i did not specify the parameters for the return type. Thus instead of simply
 template 
 Vector Vector::operator + (Vector v2) const
 I must declare it as:
 template 
 Vector Vector::operator + (Vector v2) const
 I was using a &quot;concrete&quot; return type &#x27;Vector&#x27;, but this type is parameterized, hence why the compiler complains, it doesnt know what parameter to use for the return type. 
 Here is my header file &quot;Vector.h&quot;
 #ifndef VECTOR_H #define VECTOR_H #include  #include  #define PI 3.14159265 #define RadConv PI/180.0; #define DegConv 180.0/PI; template  class Vector { private: type x1; type x2; type x3; bool Is3dVector; public: Vector(t…</span>

                              <span>How do people approach using random numbers in C++, particularly if you have more than one distribution in use? Generator each, global generator, function returning a static? How would you test any of these approaches? 
 For example, if I have two classes moving things in two different ways, each could have it&#x27;s own generator:
 class Trace { 
 std::mt19937 gen{std::random_device{}()};
 std::uniform_real_distribution dist{ 0.0, 1.0 }; 
 // other stuff including an update method using these
 };
 class Seek { 
 std::mt19937 gen{std::random_device{}()};
 std::uniform_real_distribution dist{ -1.0, 1.0 }; 
 // other stuff including an update method using these
 }; 
 What approaches do people take? What are the pros and cons? How do you test your code?

                              <span>I have never used threading before, but I would like to learn. I have a program in C++ which generates small crossword boards and it&#x27;s quite calculation heavy. It&#x27;s a backtracking algorithm so basically it explores one path, backtracks, tries another, backtracks, etc. Therefore I could see the benefit of exploring multiple paths at the same time, using threading.
 However in practice I don&#x27;t really know how much threading would speed things up. Threading is used for I/O operations involving waiting, but there&#x27;s no waiting involved here, so would it even be useful? Furthermore, how many threads could I get away with creating? I couldn&#x27;t tell you if 10 or 100 is a good number of threads for one program.

Which skills should a senior developer have?
 What would you suggest to a junior/mid developer for their seniority journey?
  
I am working as an embedded software developer (C++, Yocto, etc). I would be happy if you add additional info about embedded industry.

                              <span>So it is fully possible to use #define with parenthesis to, for instance, make a an add &quot;function&quot; like this:
 #define ADD(x, y) ((x) + (y)) void foo() { std::cout &lt;&lt; ADD(3, 7) &lt;&lt; std::endl; } 
 My first question here, is this good or bad C++ practice? I&#x27;ve heard that &quot;macros are evil&quot; but don&#x27;t fully understand why or what it even means.
 On the the real question of the post, is it possible to use #define with curly brackets? I might give some of you a heart attack now so let&#x27;s just view this as an example. Is it possible to do something like this:
 #define private_namespace{a} namespace{a} private_namespace{ void some_function() {...} int some_other_function() {...} } 
 In this case you might say &quot;Why not just write #define private_namespace namespace?&quot; to which my answer is a) this is more of a hypothetical question for learning purposes and b) then the coder could write private_namespace some_namespace {...} instead of namespace some_namespace {...}.

                              <span>ctreg (pronounced cuh-tredge) is a library for compile-time regular expressions the way they were always meant to be: at compile time! It&#x27;s a macro that takes a regular expression and produces two things:
  
A type containing the compiled internal representation of the regular expression, or as close as we can get given the tools available to us. This means no runtime errors and faster regex object construction.
 A type containing all of the named capture groups in the expression, and a captures method that infallibly captures them. Unconditional capture groups are always present when a match is found, while optional or alternated groups appear as Option. This is a significant ergonomic improvmenet over fallibly accessing groups by string or integer key at runtime.
  
Interestingly, we currently don&#x27;t do any shenanigans with OnceLock or anything similar. That was my original intention, but because the macro can&#x27;t offer anything meaningful over doing it yourself, we&#x27;ve elected to adopt the principles of zero-cost abstractions for now and have callers opt-in to whatever object management pattern makes the most sense for their use case. In the future I might add this if I can find a good, clean pattern for it.
 This version is 1.0, but I still have plenty of stuff I want to add. My current priority is reaching approximate feature pairity with the regex crates: useful cargo features for tuning performance and unicode behavior, and a more comprehensive API for variations on find operations.

 I wanted to leave in large part because I felt my boss and my team didn&#x27;t really respect me. My boss explicitly told me no one on the team likes me. I basically became entirely disattached from work and kinda started disliking my teammates because the environment felt extremely hostile
 A few days later, we had a meeting that was optional where we discuss tech. I tend not to attend them because they&#x27;re either not talking about something relevant to me in any way, or if it&#x27;s frontend, I figure they probably don&#x27;t want to hear from me (goes back to &quot;the team not liking me&quot;). Today it was on figma. My boss angrily messaged me asking why I wasn&#x27;t there since I&#x27;m the &quot;figma expert&quot;. I am not a figma expert.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never had a career nor a degree, and have always held menial data entry -type jobs. I like computers and programming so I thought I&#x27;d try for a CS degree thinking that would be a good job going into the future... Except now I keep seeing things about how AI is going to make a lot of entry level programming jobs obsolete - probably the same jobs I would be applying to once my degree of finished. So did I choose poorly? I am mainly interested in programming and cyber security. Will be job outlooks be poor in the near the future? Should I pivot to something else?

                              <span>Hello,
 I’ve been working on my next project, &quot;Planetaries,&quot; an open-world sci-fi TD survival game. You’re probably wondering what the TD part is all about. Well, it’s a significant aspect of the game where you defend your base and earn Tech Points to unlock new technology in your tech tree. However, it’s not a necessity; you can choose to farm your own way, explore, or complete contracts to obtain technology. The game also supports multiplayer.
 Teaser:
 In the teaser footage, I’m showcasing some of the environments, gathering mechanics, alien life, points of interest, combat, player base interactions, character movement, overall feel, and theme of the game.
 Feedback:
 I’d like to hear your thoughts on all these aspects, including the graphics.
 Development Teaser [on the Steam page]:
 https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800450/Planetaries/
 Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t do it. I&#x27;m actually not joking, If I had a time machine to 15 years ago, sigh
 Though if the hubris does overwhelm, pick an easier game genre, Something one person can do, no matter how brilliant you think you are, you really are not. Still it could of been worse I could of chosen a MMORPGGGGGH
 Don&#x27;t make a major gameplay change midway (I done 2 on this game adventure, turn based -&gt; realtime &amp; dungeons -&gt; Open World). Lesson learnt, If the game ain&#x27;t happening, scrap it and start something new, don&#x27;t try to shoehorn what you have into this cause it will bite you in the ass later 
 Don&#x27;t roll your own code. i.e re-invent the wheel, Sure this is oldhat advice. But take it from an oldfart, dont. I went from my own engine in c++/opengl &amp; my own physics engine -&gt; my engine + ODE -&gt; Unity &amp; C#. I wasn&#x27;t cool rolling my own, I was just a dick wasting hours, hours that could of been useful realizing my dream 
  
Positive advice:
  
Only 2 rules in programming
 #1 KISS - Always keep it simple, you may think you&#x27;re smart doing some shortcut or elegant solution, but 50% of the time you&#x27;re creating problems down the track, why roll the dice, play it smart. OK this is a mantra but #2 is not well known
 #2 Treat everything as equal. AKA - don&#x27;t make exceptions, no matter how much sense they appear to make, inevitably it will bite you in the ass later
 Now I still violate both the rules even now (after 40 years of programming) So this is do as I say, not as I do thing
 Don&#x27;t be afraid to go out of your comfort zone. Myself, In the last couple of years, I&#x27;ve (with my GF) had my child, something I swear I would never do (It happened though) &amp; gone to help in Ukraine. Both totally unrelated BTW

                              <span>Idk I wouldn&#x27;t even consider myself a developer. I&#x27;ve only released mods for existing games, and am only about 5% done with my first &quot;original&quot; game. Sometimes I&#x27;ll have inspiration or ideas for something then think of a game I love and think &quot;Wow I&#x27;ll never be able to make something that good.&quot; or &quot;What is the point if anything I make is just a worse version of an existing game?&quot; and I know that&#x27;s partially my various mental issues talking, but idk sometimes I just take a hit to my motivation when I think about that, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not alone. Just curious how others feel about stuff like that? 
 Then again the fact I&#x27;ve made any step towards achieving my dreams before I hit 20 is probably a miracle...

                              <span>I played around dissembling memov and memcpy and found out intresting stuff.
 1. with -Os they are both the same and they use &quot;rep movsd&quot; as the main way to do things.
 2. if you dont include the headers you actually get materially different assembly. it wont inline those function calls and considering they are like 2 istructions thats a major loss
 3. you can actually get quite far with essentially guessing what the implementation should be. they are actually about what I would expect like I seen movsd and thought &quot;i bet you can memov with that&quot; turns out I was right

                              <span>Hey Folks!
 I am starting off with C as my first ever programming language. (I have some prior programming experience with C and Python but never managed to go pass the basics. Hopefully I will get to a point where I can do something useful with these languages around this time)
 Nonetheless, I am following the classic &quot;The C Programming Language&quot; by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. In the introductory chapter (A TUTORIAL INTRODUCTION - Page 6), the first example to print Hello World goes something like this:
 # include  main () { printf(&quot;Hello, world\n&quot;); } 
 When I compiled it with the cc or gcc compiler, an error was produced:
 error: return type defaults to &#x27;int&#x27; 
 Naturally, I went back to the thought process that I had in my previous attempts at learning C. I simply declared the return type for the main() function to be void and it compiled successfully. The changed code goes like this:
 # include  void main () { printf(&quot;Hello, world\n&quot;); } 
 What am I missing out from the example? Has it something to do with the Compiler Version that I am on? Or is it something entirely different?

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m getting started with C and I need some guidance, I made this function with the little knowledge I have, and I&#x27;d like to know if I&#x27;m on the right track : I&#x27;ve read this would be a bad idea if this function would return a string, that it&#x27;d be better if it modified the string instead of letting the user, I&#x27;d like your take on that, also how what would be a sensible max length limit for a string in this function ? I have too many questions though, so any suggestions are welcome. Thank you all, I&#x27;m already learning a lot thanks to this sub.
 void to_uppercase(char* string) { int str_len &#x3D; strlen(string); char converted[str_len]; for (int i &#x3D; 0; i  122) { continue; } converted[i] &#x3D; string[i] - 32; } string[str_len] &#x3D; &#x27;\0&#x27;; strncpy(string, converted, str_len); }

                              <span>Heya, how can I prevent the repeated keypresses that happen when a key is held down? All I want is for 
 int c &#x3D; &#x27;\0&#x27;; If (read(0, &amp;c, 1) !&#x3D; -1 ) { printf(&quot;%c\r\n&quot;, c); } 
 To only print the character when it is pressed and when it is released, or alternatively print constantly when being held down. My terminal is in raw mode, and this is all in a while loop obviously. Thanks in advance. I don&#x27;t have access to curses/ncurses. Just C standard library and administrator privileges XD

 }
 In this program, while trying to print a[7] which should be out of bound, it prints the value that was initialized above it. Do anyone know what is happening??
 Also when initializing two variables, i and j, and trying to print a[7] and a[8], both will print 0 on my VS code, but prints values of j and i respectively. On an online compiler, the output changes each time it is run.

                              <span>Take neofetch for example. When we run it prints the ASCII logo left hand side, and the information right hand side. I want to do that in C but I&#x27;m not sure how exactly.
 If I read the ASCII logo from a file, and if I try to read it line by line, and print it (left-side) alongside the information (right-side) I think it&#x27;s possible in that way, but it would be very inefficient. Any ideas how to do it in C? An example would be very nice!
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am learning C from Ritchie&#x27;s book (released in 1988) and in the third example in his book, the temperature converter program from fahrenheit degrees to celsius does not work. It is cycled indefinitely at a first line. I am curious as to why this is, because it&#x27;s odd that someone who developed C would write bogus program in the guide to learn it. I am editing in Visual studio code and GCC compiler and have all the updates installed for C/C++ libraries.
 This is the code I wrote exactly as is in the book:
 #include  main() { int fahr, celsius; int lower, upper, step; lower &#x3D; 0; upper &#x3D; 300; step &#x3D; 20; fahr &#x3D; lower; while (fahr &lt;&#x3D; upper) { celsius &#x3D; 5 * (fahr - 32) / 9; printf(&quot;%d\t%d\n&quot;, fahr, celsius); fahr, fahr + step; } }

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I’ve recently started taking the Nand2Tetris course. I am currently in week 6 of the first course, which deals mainly with hardware.
 This week though, it is required to build an assembler, which is the first software above the hardware. The course teachers say it can be built with any programming language, like Java and Python.
 The thing is, right now I am mostly familiar with C, but I am also not an expert. I’ve programmed in Python on the past, but I will need to refresh, as I have used C more lately.
 But should I build the assembler, and maybe the next required software (I think it is a VM and a compiler), with C? Like isn’t it too complicated because of all the memory management you have to consider, no classes (as opposed to C++) etc.?
 Also, if you’re familiar with this course, I would like to consult with you if you think I should proceed to the second part? Or take CS50x before, which I have heard is very good for starting out with programming? Is Nand2Tetris part 2 recommended in general?
 Thanks in advance.

 it works like this:
 int x &#x3D; 3; match(x, (gt(20), printf(&quot;greater than 20!&quot;)), (lte(50), printf(&quot;lower than 50!&quot;)), (true, printf(&quot;NEITHER&quot;)), ); 
 and can be used in expression like:
 int y &#x3D; match_exp(x, (in_range(5,10), 7), (gt(5), 5), (PAT &lt; 20, 4), (true, 1), );

                              <span>I have a question when it comes to rounding in C. Does it round up or down at .5? If it does round up, then does that mean that the smallest value of k in the code below can only be 1?
  int main() { int k &#x3D; 13; int i; for (i &#x3D; 0; i &gt;&#x3D; 1; } printf(&quot;%n&quot;); }

                              <span>Just today GCC released version 14.1, with this key line
  
Structure, union and enumeration types may be defined more than once in the same scope with the same contents and the same tag; if such types are defined with the same contents and the same tag in different scopes, the types are compatible.
  
Which means GCC now lets you do this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;c
 include 
 define Resultt(T, E) struct Result##T##_##E { bool is_ok; union { T value; E error; }; }
 define Ok(T, E) (struct Result##T####E){ .is_ok &#x3D; true, .value &#x3D; (T) _OK_IMPL
 define OK_IMPL(...) __VA_ARGS_ }
 define Err(T, E) (struct Result##T####E){ .is_ok &#x3D; false, .error &#x3D; (E) _ERR_IMPL
 define ERR_IMPL(...) __VA_ARGS_ }
 typedef const char *ErrorMessage_t;
 Result_t(int, ErrorMessage_t) my_func(int i) { if (i &#x3D;&#x3D; 42) return Ok(int, ErrorMessage_t)(100); else return Err(int, ErrorMessage_t)(&quot;Cannot do the thing&quot;); }
 int main() { Result_t(int, ErrorMessage_t) x &#x3D; my_func(42);
 if (x.is_ok) { printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, x.value); } else { printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, x.error); } 
 } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

 We can now have template-like structures in C!

                              <span>Anyone have any recommendations on how to make DevOps/development work less consuming? I currently work as a staff level engineer and do some dev work for some interesting OSS projects on my spare time.
 Recently after taking a 2w vacation without much work going on (bless Asia’s cable cuts for creating a 300ms+ latency back to Europe) I realize how much of my life has really been consumed by just dev work instead of doing other things that I want like hiking etc. Sometimes it’s just a bug or something I’m too focused on and end up spending a lot of time on, or some new feature that I’m building…
 Anyone else have this issue or have any advice about it?

                              <span>Hi Yall, 
 I&#x27;m curious on your opinions on the right relationship between fullstack developers and sre when it comes to ownership of load balancing and security services (authorization, EDR, etc.)?
 In this case our fullstack team owns development of a customer facing product which includes our SAAS API and various front ends. The API is composed of micro-services. It does biz logic things like user management, fetching results, ingesting media inputs and passing them into our core engine which is owned by MLEs... 
 We are a small startup, I am the first and only devops engineer at the moment. I initially wrote authorization and owned load balancing into the system but out of feeling that I was spread too thin I passed this ownership off to the fullstack team. My sense over the past few months is that the fullstack team shouldn&#x27;t ideally own load balancing and authorization, they tend to do things really quickly and dirtily and I suppose I&#x27;m not fully comfortable with their approach. My sense is that this should be owned by security minded SREs who are already responsible for production.
 Can you guys assist in providing insight into my potential blindspots? What are your thoughts?
 Thanks!

 Most interesting is how file structure, partitioning and layer interaction is organized.

                              <span>Would Golang be a good choice as a primary language for a mid size SaaS startup?
 It would consist of a back office and public facing website that serves data managed in the back office.
 It would not have any performance critical parts, such as realtime computing, concurent actions or server to server communication.
 My major concern with golang would be speed of development cycle and how well would it behave in a startup environvment with ever changing requirements?
 Another thing would be how easy or costly would it be to find good Golang talent with limited budget of a startup?

                              <span>As I&#x27;ve understood, the main purpose of c++20 modules is to speed up compilation without the need to separate declarations and definitions.
 But by &quot;merging&quot; the .cpp and .h files in a single module file, that file will contain all the imports / includes, which will increase the chance of circular dependencies.
 I know that we can still use forward declarations with modules, but now we would be required to not only forward declare a class, but also its methods that we want to use.
 What&#x27;s the best way to avoid this issue when using modules?

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m pretty new to C++, and am trying to create a custom free() function that takes data from a used linked list and moves it to a free LL. It correctly works when the data being removed from the Used LL encompasses the entirety of the list, but not so much when the data is only partial. The malloc() function works with partial data, so I&#x27;m confused. I am using a 32-bit integer with two flags at the front to store the data, one that determines the type and one that determines if there&#x27;s data above it. I&#x27;ve placed both functions below, and need help. Thank you!
 void *Mem::malloc( const uint32_t _size ) { Used* pUsed &#x3D; nullptr; //search free list for block &gt;&#x3D; input size assert(this-&gt;poHeap !&#x3D; nullptr); Free* pFree &#x3D; this-&gt;poHeap-&gt;pFreeHead; while (pFree !&#x3D; nullptr) { //traverse list …</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m pretty new to cpp and am trying to work out the best design for a problem I&#x27;m having. I&#x27;m wondering if shared pointers are the way to go. 
 The problem: I have a class that makes an expensive database query during construction. The information retrieved is static though and most of the class functions don&#x27;t even depend on the data. Furthermore, a class instance might be constructed multiple times during a single call from the upstream application , and each time this expensive and often unnecessary db call is made.
 My idea: Lazy load the db query only when it&#x27;s first needed and then store the data in a global cache that will exist for the entirety of the application call. I can&#x27;t control if 10 instances of this class are created, but I can limit to a single db call instead of 10. 
 Is a shared pointer amongst the class instances a feasible and a solution here? My understanding is that the a shared pointer to the cache will keep it alive as I need, but I&#x27;m unsure how to pass a pointer between the instances like this. I&#x27;m also wondering if I&#x27;m overthinking the problem and there is a simpler solution I&#x27;m not considering. I&#x27;d appreciate any advice or insight, thanks!

                              <span>Looking into using BCrypt.h for various crypto stuff. MSDN indicates the following for BCryptOpenAlgorithmProvider:
  
Because of the number and type of operations that are required to find, load, and initialize an algorithm provider, the BCryptOpenAlgorithmProvider function is a relatively time intensive function. Because of this, we recommend that you cache any algorithm provider handles that you will use more than once, rather than opening and closing the algorithm providers over and over.
  
This implies to me that you can globally initialize the algorithm handle and reuse it throughout your application in all threads. But since MSDN doesn&#x27;t say anything about it, I&#x27;m not sure whether that&#x27;s true or if the handle caching guidance applies per thread.
 Can anyone shed some light on this?

 After deleting the build folder, clean and rebuilding, the issue never happens again until I re-open VS Code.
 I&#x27;m currently using the latest version of Visual Studio Code alongside the following extensions:
  
CMake by twxs
 CMake Tools by ms-vscode
 CodeLLDB by vadimcn
 C/C++ Intellisense, debugging, and code browsing
  
Btw, OpenAL-Soft was added to my engine project which is a library my game includes.
 I&#x27;m running:
  
Latest version of VSCode
 Compiler: Clang 17.0.6
 OS: Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4
 OpenGL 4.2
 Windowing: GLFW
 Also using GLAD.
  
I could just delete and rebuild everything every every morning, but doing this would mean rebuilding my entire project. Has this every happened to you?
 Any tips or recommendations are greatly appreciated.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Many c++ open source projects are header only because building and installing is the hard part - rather then needing to be. Theres excellent resources for using CMake yourself but less so for shipping your library with CMake.
 This how-to explains why testing is important and how you can implement CI. This is a great thing to contribute back to the projects you use!

                              <span>Hello everyone, I understand that this issue is really complex and probably involves something terribly wrong somewhere else in the code, but I&#x27;m seriously stuck and hoping someone can shed some light on this.
 I&#x27;m using Ubuntu 22.04, with Clang++.
 Ubuntu clang version 14.0.0-1ubuntu1.1 Target: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu Thread model: posix InstalledDir: /usr/bin 
 This code should have no visible effects whatsoever:
 std::thread([]() { for(;;); }).detach(); 
 And yet, if I place it anywhere in my code, it either segfaults, double-calls functions that are only called once, throws an exception from some unexpected destructor (as if it&#x27;s exiting the nested scope when it isn&#x27;t), etc.
 One example of where I tried this, while trying to isolate the problem, is here:
 // static void test() // { // for…</span>
                            </span>

 Technically this is C but the C sub is often uncooperative. Will also post there, but answers here are always faster

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m on the hunt for a linear algebra library that implements the upcoming std::linalg standard from C++26 (details here). Given that the standard will likely not be widely supported by compilers until around 2030, I&#x27;m interested in using a library that aligns with std::linalg now. This would allow for a seamless transition to std::linalg once it becomes broadly available. 
 So far, I haven’t found a library that meets these criteria. I did come across this post, but it wasn’t quite what I needed. If anyone knows of a library that fits this description, I would really appreciate your recommendations.
 Additionally, if anyone is aware of a wrapper for any established libraries like Eigen, Armadillo, BLAS, LAPACK, xtensor, or Blaze that adapts their functionality to align with the proposed std::linalg standard in C++26, I’d be very interested in learning about it. Such a wrapper would ideally allow for easier migration to std::linalg when it becomes standard. Please share any leads or resources you might have.
 Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>Hello everyone.
 I’m relatively new to C++ and have a project im working on. The basis of the project is a basketball game where randomized players and their stats are generated through a draft system then stored into multiple text files. 
 I have correlated the players and their attributes using array positions. I have the system set up correctly where I can write the data to the text file and read from it but I am unable to run the code unless I manually go and delete the info from the text file. Only when I do this do the errors disappear.
 It defeats the point if the players stats are not able to be retrieved the first time they were drafted in the game, as I want to be able to implement a save feature where you can pick up where you left off. I have implemented this by creating a main menu, with a switch function, allowing a player to either reset their data by truncating the text files, and undergo the draft process all over again, or continue with the information already in the text file. The issue is however, as I said before, I cannot run this without deleting the data in the file, which I do not want the player to have to do unless they want to reset the game.
 The errors themselves are 2 C2059 errors and Expected a Declaration in the text file themself, which confused me.

 I&#x27;ve worked in two different codebases so far, and like many other C++ devs I find myself frustrated and almost a little insecure inside about how little I know about these features.

                              <span>Hello,
 I was just wondering has anyone looked into/watched this https://youtu.be/-TkoO8Z07hI?si&#x3D;rtK_l1g4SlIwgauw to get started with cpp? I was going to start using it but didn’t know if it would be good to use, only for the fact it seems to be beginner level which is good, but doesn’t give you an idea what to do after to keep growing your skills and knowledge. I’ve heard learncpp is good so should I just do that? Any advice is welcomed. Thank you.

                              <span>I am new to c++, mainly a Typescript dev.
 In TS, I can return union types where it can be either &#x60;this&#x60; or &#x60;that&#x60;:
 // Typescript function - union return. function cheese(a: string): false | string { if (a.length &lt; 2) { return false; } return a; } 
 In this trivial example, I can return a false OR a string.
 How can I achieve the same thing in C++? It&#x27;s okay if the whole pattern needs to be different, but I want to be able to return different types from a function... if possible.
 Thanks.

If you work with physical units in your code, you should check it out (and watch the CppCon videos). I really like it&#x27;s design philosophy. Shout out to Chip Hogg and other contributors--nice work!

 Not necessarily for hacking (I wasn&#x27;t sure where else to ask this), it could be a tool for audio, networking, hacking, communication, etc, usually found for like $100 or less, but not always. Just trying to find out if there is a name for this style of device that I can search for to find more just for learning/research...thanks!

                              <span>Hello dear brothers and sisters,
 After having a very harsh life, an opportunity has finally presented itself and I decided to get my CCNA certification earlier this year (on my first try). However, it is still extremely difficult to get my life back on track. As a matter of fact, months are quietly passing by and nobody has called me about a job interview, not even once.
 Of course, that couldn&#x27;t stop me from being curious about technology (and networking in particular), so I have moved on and continued with acquiring new skills on my own. My next stop was Kali linux (which I love very deeply) and pretty soon I got obsessed with network penetration. Over the course of time I have continued to learn about most important tools and techniques through books, whitepapers and official documenta…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty good at programming in C for a Linux computer but I am interested to learn how it differs when programming for an embedded device.
 I had a couple of questions that I had trouble finding answers for on Google and was hoping someone could help me understand.
  
In Linux, GCC compiles my c code into an elf file which can then be loaded into memory when executed. Is there a similar process like this for embedded devices? For example, can GCC generate binaries that are flashed onto embedded devices, or do each embedded device have its own compiler?
 
Since Linux syscalls generally don&#x27;t exist on embedded devices, what c functions can I use when programming for embedded? I&#x27;m assuming that glibc wouldn&#x27;t be available and printf doesn&#x27;t exist but do utility header files such as stdint.h still exists?
 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 I’m in the process of writing a software in C which has the following features:
  
A Touchscreen GUI which displays realtime data about a “remote device” and allows sending commands to it.
 A network part which handles the communication with that remote device via ethernet
 A hardware part which handles communication with a custom pcb with encoders, leds and buttons
  
The software runs on a Raspberry, the “remote device” is connected via ethernet and the local hardware via serial. 
 Basically the software should perform the following operations: 
  
Check for incoming ethernet data, if so update parameters of remote device which are stored in a struct (basically a local copy of all of the remote unit parameters). The remote unit constantly sends it’s parameters at roughl…</span>

                              <span>I need help
 I need to do a program with a belman ford algorithm, I tryied but for some reason it works with some case tests, giving the expected output, but not with others, and I don&#x27;t know why
 #include  #include  #include  #include  #define msize 100 #define INF 99999999 int test &#x3D; false; int BellmanFord(int bfor[msize][msize], int N, int M, int X, int Y) { int d[msize]; for (int i &#x3D; 0; i  d[i] + bfor[i][j]) { d[j] &#x3D; d[i] + bfor[i][j]; } } } for (int i &#x3D; 0; i  d[i] + bfor[i][j]) { test &#x3D; true; printf (&quot;O grafo tem ciclo de custo negativo\n&quot;); return 0; } } } return d[Y]; } int main() { int N, M; int A, B, C; int Q; int X, Y, Z &#x3D; 0; int bfor[msize][msize]; FILE *file; file &#x3D; fopen(&quot;entrada.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;); while (fscanf (file, &quot;%d %d&quot;, &amp;N, &amp;M) !&#x3D; EOF) { for (int i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; N; i++) { for (int j &#x3D; 0; j &lt; N; j++) { bfor[i][j] &#x3D; INF; } } int flag &#x3D; M; while (flag--) { fscanf(file, &quot;%d %d %d&quot;, &amp;A, &amp;B, &amp;C); bfor[A-1][B-1] &#x3D; C; } fscanf (file, &quot;%d&quot;, &amp;Q); while (Q--) { fscanf (file, &quot;%d %d&quot;, &amp;X, &amp;Y); X-&#x3D;1; Y-&#x3D;1; Z &#x3D; BellmanFord(bfor, N, M, X, Y); if (test !&#x3D; true) { printf (&quot;%d\n&quot;, Z); } } test &#x3D; false; } } 
 the input is:

 2 3 -9
 1 3 2

 4 5 -1
 5 6 -1
 1 6 1

 1 6
 4 6
 the output ends up being:
 1
 -9
 -1
 -1
 The graph contains a negative cycle
 But it should be:
 1
 -9
 The graph contains a negative cycle
 -1
 -2
 I don&#x27;t know why or how to solve this problem, could someone help?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I want to build a GCC cross compiler for the tricore target architecture that runs on a windows host. I could do this directly on Windows using some environment like MSYS2 or w64devkit.
 I was wondering, since MinGW GCC is also available on Linux, can I build the cross-compiler such as host&#x3D;x86_64-w64-mingw32, build&#x3D;x86_64-linux-gnu and target&#x3D;tricore? Basically building a cross-compiler using a cross-compiler..
 I know it sounds silly, but would be really helpful since our CI runs on Linux and I want to automate the process. Sorry if it&#x27;s not the proper subreddit for such questions!

                              <span>Hi all, I am learning multithreading for a little sideproject. Right now, before implementing anything I&#x27;m trying to learn the fundamentals of threads and how they work in C. I made a really simple program to see how efficiency differs with threads and... it&#x27;s twice slower (?) 
 At first I was using a unique buffer but I then read that it&#x27;s better for threads to access separate memory locations so i made 3 different buffers, one for each thread, Here&#x27;s my code and a little explanation. Feel free to destroy me if I misunderstood something, I&#x27;m trying to learn so every tip is appreciated. 
 ​
 Code explanation: I created a simple struct containing a dinamic array of int, which size will be allocated accordingly in the main function, and a file pointer where values will be printed.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;m a relative beginner to C, my goal is to write a web server on Linux myself without looking it up, or without looking up examples online at least, I feel like I would just end up copying it and I want to go about it properly. I think it would massively boost my coding skills as well as help me understand web servers better. 
 I&#x27;m curious what your process is for doing this, or what process do you recommend? As far as I understand, the main way to &quot;look up how to use something&quot; like sockets is to use man pages, and do you just reference those and keep looking at whatever you don&#x27;t understand for the next thing and next thing to etc.? I feel like I have about 50 terminal tabs open because I&#x27;m down the rabbit hole of reading man pages, not complaining because I&#x27;ve found out some super interesting stuff, it just doesn&#x27;t feel super efficient. 
 Let me know if that&#x27;s just what we do or if you have some other method, I get there&#x27;s obviously books as well. I&#x27;m a bit sick of tutorials and learn how to code sites, especially when I know the basics reasonably well and just want to get onto building something. 
 Cheers!

 I dont use cmake so some of the things i say may be wrong, but i believe when you run &quot;mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make&quot; this will ignore files from this library that are in the tools/ directory. Is there a way to add those aswell to be build also?

I got in an argument with my friend and he told me that I was lazy and begging for a job, I have been trying for 6 months with one company that wants me but can&#x27;t give me an offer yet because no project. all I have done is network and apply to positions and fix my resume. Nor really getting interviews. Is this because my github is lacking commits or because my resume isn&#x27;t right and I am not talking to the right people or is it a combination of both?

 What&#x27;s the best way get technical? Associates in CS? Bachelors? There&#x27;s no way I qualify for a Masters program. Get a job related certification and fill in the gaps as I go?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been interviewing quite a few people recently for a remote role and noticed most don&#x27;t bother turning on their camera. It&#x27;s a bit awkward but I decided to keep mine on anyway.
 Is this very common in your experience?
 I assume they might do it for bias reasons (definitely had women not wanting to get judged because of their appearance and I get that from what I&#x27;ve seen in our field) or just don&#x27;t feel like it. I didn&#x27;t push for it as I generally tend to have my team decide by themselves if they turn their camera on during meetings and glad to do as much as possible in Slack. But for a first time meeting people I still find it super hard to... bond with them and then later tell them apart. Or even hire someone without ever having seen their face once.
 Last time I interviewed people for my team a few years ago I didn&#x27;t notice this, most just seemed to turn on the cam without having it explicitly stated.
 EDIT: 
 For the next rounds I&#x27;ll definitely see that I explicitly state &quot;video call&quot;. I was just surprised people don&#x27;t do this by default but perhaps I&#x27;m just becoming boomer :). But there&#x27;s a &quot;give a talk and we discuss&quot; round anyway, so I hope at least there they&#x27;ll turn their cam on.
 I should probably add, this is for a very senior/scientific role, so we also have to meet customers at least virtually, pitch projects, give talks, hold webinars, perhaps go to a conference etc.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a software dev with 6 years experience, I love my current role. 6 figures, wfh, and an amazing team with the most relaxed boss of all time, but I wanted to test the job market out so I started applying for a few jobs ranging from 80 - 200k, I could not get a single one. 
 This seems so odd, even entry roles I was flat out denied, let alone the higher up ones. 
 Now I&#x27;m not mad cause I already have a role, but is the market this bad? have we hit the point where CS is beyond oversaturated? my only worry is the big salaries are only going to diminish as people get more and more desperate taking less money just to have anything. 
 This really sucks, and worries me.
 Edit: Guys this was not some peer reviewed research experiment, just a quick test. A few things.
  
I am a U.S. Citizen
 I did only apply for work from home jobs which are ultra competitive and would skew the data. 
  
This was more of a discussion to see what the community had to say, nothing more.

 What have you seen in your experience drives that? Are there common pitfalls and mistakes that you&#x27;ve seen ICs who&#x27;ve become managers make that affects their ability to be managers?

                              <span>My boss, the tech lead who at one point was the sole developer on the team, keeps handing over his half-assed / half-completed projects to me. 
 He&#x27;ll do 30-40% of the work, write zero documentation, and then will tell me to finish it without giving me any context. 
 My boss is the kind of guy who has trouble delegating tasks on a product that&#x27;s his &quot;baby&quot; and really wants to keep his hands in everything that happens.
 I get that as a senior developer it&#x27;s my job to work on complicated things, but it takes me twice as long just to understand the code he wrote as actually finishing the project. It also makes me feel like an idiot when I have to ask him a hundred questions about what he&#x27;s already done + why he made particular choices (which are often not well-thought-out). He also often takes a long time to respond (since he&#x27;s busy working on 5000 other tasks) leaving me confused and frustrated.
 Better yet, if I end up taking a long time to understand what he&#x27;s done / finish the solution, he&#x27;ll get impatient and then will try to finish it himself. 
 This jobs has a lot of perks and I&#x27;m generally left alone most of the time (which is great), but I&#x27;m getting pretty demoralized.

                              <span>I joined this large global company in 2016. It was pretty good back then. Autonomous teams with great developers building great products. My country was very profitable. 
 2018 it is decided that most development work in my country would be moved to India. Our senior developers would now work as architects, product owners and team leads. Most of our great developers decided to jump the ship. I decided to stick around.
 2018-2020 is a disaster. Everything falls apart. Its so bad that there is a new decision to switch back to 100% inhouse development.
 2021, its hard to recruit great developers and we need to recruit a lot of people. Management and HR is not happy with the progress, too many candidates fail the technical interviews, its taking too long to sign new employees. It is decided that there will be no technical interviews from now on, HR will handle 100% of the recruitment process. Focus on &quot;soft values and skills&quot;.
 2022, it is still a disaster. We have signed a lot of new emoloyees, most with wrong skillsets due to HR having no clue about what we need. We needed senior software developers and we got database admins, sysadmins, service desk agents etc that wanted to get into software development. 
 2024, we are still in a very bad state, and guess what? The solution is to move development to India again. The history repeats. 
 I should obviously jump the ship, i used to be a developer, now i just spend my time in crisis meetings, escalations, red alerts, meetings with management etc. However i find this mess to be very entertaining. I always enjoy going to work to find out what madness is going on today. Its like a great tv show, i cant wait for the next episode.
 Has anyone been in a similar situation? Enjoying a terrible place to work at? What did you do?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve worked in front-end web dev before, although 95% of my experience is in systems, machine learning, and gamedev as a hobby in c++, java, c#, python etc. I&#x27;ve definitely had an interest in doing web development and I have worked in a small team before to do a simple web app, but I found that the process was absolutely agonizing. 
 ​
 Specifically, javascript seems to take my least favorite aspects of all the languages I know, and puts them together in one singular package seemingly designed from the ground up to make development as frustrating as humanely possible. 
 ​
 I&#x27;m learning rust now but I consider myself a beginner still, and even though I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m quite past the initial growing pains with getting used to it, I am enjoying it and I&#x27;m all for trying out literally any alternative in existence to using javascript again. 
 ​
 So as someone who knows nothing about it beyond skimming through the first page of google, do any of you actively use rust for front end? What&#x27;s the current limitations? I can imagine countless benefits to using it over javascript, but are there any drawbacks to using rust for it over javascript? 
 ​
 I know absolutely nothing about it, and my web dev knowledge overall is extremely rusty and likely outdated. But are you somehow working with frameworks like react but with rust? Or bindings? CSS? Any sort of generalized idea of how it works, what the experience is like and maybe some pointers on good resources for getting started would be really appreciated

                              <span>Hi. I want to write my own NES &quot;cartridge decoder&quot; that will serve as a helper tool during development of my NES emulator. One of it&#x27;s capabilities will be dissasembly of a PRG ROM. However the thing with these ROMs is that data is mixed up with the code and it can look roughly like this:
 
 
 
  
 And etc. So if you are looking at compiled binary you really have no way of telling whether given byte is treated as instruction, instruction operand (or part of it) or data used by the program.
 I came up with 2 approaches how I could tackle this:
  
Lazy approach - Just interpret everything as instruction (of course by taking their variable length into account)
 Better approach - Interpret the program, not exactly by executing it but going instruction by instruction, tracking where it jumps or which subroutines it calls. While processing branch instructions process both cases. Read interrupt vectors and interpret them as well until reaching RTS instruction. Everything else would be considered raw data and dead code would also fall into that category. Basically disassembler would go instruction by instruction to determine where code execution can lead to distinguish instructions from the data.
  
I never specifically wrote a dissasembler, so I would like to know if my ideas are at least good, or there are better, more reliable approaches to that out there.

                              <span>Hi All, I&#x27;m working on implementing the serial port in my Gameboy emulator. I&#x27;m trying to understand how the serial port hardware interacts with the system clock. From the documentation I&#x27;ve found online, it seem like the serial port derives its clock from the system clock directly, instead of through the timer DIV, like the audio hardware:
 Cycle-Accurate Game Boy Docs, Section 6
 Does this mean that even when the serial port is not enabled (via SC bit-7) this counter is increasing? What happens when the serial port is enabled? Does the counter reset to 0?

I’m sure people have figured out a way to automate this, I’ve found dependabot and renovatebot, but wondering what people use and how they use it to find a good solution

                              <span>I looked at the prospect of jobs as code with control-m back in 2021, and was overwhelmed by the Automation API and determined that for us, octopus run books can cover our use cases for now, since most could be done with a combination of SQL and PowerShell.
 Granted control m is kinda silo’d at our organization so we don’t have great automation support. 
 Octopus isn’t really compared to competitors of control-m, so I feel like I’m missing something. Can anyone straighten me out?
 Thanks

                              <span>The build stage is taking so long (with a timeout set to 1 hour, often reached…)
 package.json contain a lot of caret and tilde ranges which will lead to inconsistent build stage duration since the command ‘npm install’ will always try to fetch the latest version of a package, and if not found it will download it…
 the use of an npm registry did not fix the issue since the process will be highly dependent on the net bandwith the Gitlab runner .
  
What I have been thinking of so far:
  
Use ‘npm ci’ instead of ‘npm install’ basing on a package-lock.json. This method required the manual update of the npm lock file, or maybe with the help of third-party tools/extensions such as Renovate through the scheduling of an update process
 Configure cache on a separate disk? (Not sure about this approach and how it could help me in this case)
  
I posted here in order to get more insights about the matter.

 I fullfill myself with music, back then played a lot of guitar but 5 years ago I switch to alto saxophone and and I try to make some electronic experiments as well - https://www.instagram.com/klimat.wav
 Aparat from that, together with my gf we plan to go to carpentry course this fall - serious one it lasts 3 semestrs (1.5 years on weekends).
 Yep, no kids :))

 So, my story began one year ago when I started making [Graveyard Gunslingers]
 Concept:
 &quot;Graveyard Gunslingers&quot; is a 3D survivors-like bullet hell game set in Wild West. You&#x27;re given 10 nights to survive. During the day, gameplay is kind of chill. You mine resources, explore, and manage your skills preparing for the night. At night, you shoot down hordes of zombies.
 The main twist in the game is its day-night cycle. The goal of this mechanic is to keep the player in a state of flow. During the day, the gameplay is relaxed, allowing the player to focus on harvesting resources and managi…</span>

For those of you working for AAA companies (or even III for that matter), what path(s) did you take to get there? Advice for someone trying to break in? Also I understand that right now isn’t necessarily the best time in terms of hiring vs layoffs, but I’m trying to play the long game here. Also, what does it realistically look like to work for a AAA company? Anyway, not looking for anything specific. Just wanting to hear from other industry professionals.

                              <span>Hello fellow game devs,
 I was wondering if anyone might be able to share some insight into what went wrong with my latest release? It&#x27;s been a week so far and the sales are not ideal to say the least. I&#x27;m genuinely interested in learning from this since I&#x27;m at a loss.
 I tried to make a unique, fun, challenging, and non-linear detective game and was really excited about it. Essentially the more you play, the more the story comes through and the pieces fit together.
 Here are some highlights of everything I&#x27;ve done leading up to release:
  
3 years of effort with 2 years of full time dev working on this game. Invested $1k into hiring proper voice actors.
 2 years ago participated in a Steam Next Fest to gather wishlists.
 2 years ago participated in a local Expo to see how players reacted …</span>

                              <span>Hello, fellow Gophers!
 I&#x27;m new to Go, transitioning from Python where I extensively used Django and FastAPI to build backends. In the Python world, I was used to riding on the shoulders of giants. Python frameworks usually provide built-in tools for authentication—everything from password validation and encryption to token expiration and third-party logins.
 Now, as I start developing my first API with Go Chi1, I&#x27;ve noticed the prevalent advice is to implement features from scratch. This shift has left me anxious about potential missteps and the risk of creating an insecure application.
 Do you all build auth from scratch when using Go Chi, or are there trusted libraries you rely on? How do you manage the complexity and ensure security? 
 1 Choosing Chi over the many other &quot;expressive, lightweight, API router&quot; was already a tough dilemma (and still I don&#x27;t know if I chose the right tool). I first started out with Fiber until someone told me &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t because it doesn&#x27;t use one of standard lib&quot; though, to be honest, I didn&#x27;t really understand the reasoning.

A Notion-level block-based note taking app
 Decentralized architecture for device-to-device encryption powered by CRDT
  
However, it has failed to appeal to ordinary users.
 Lately, I&#x27;ve been feeling that it would be worthwhile to open-source my works, so I&#x27;m sharing it here.
  
nb-crdt: (Typescript) CRDT data structure and interfaces for interacting with it
 nb-editor: (Typescript + React) editor for nb-crdt (it can be used for other data structures)
 nb-crdt-go: (Go)
 nbfm: (Go + Wails + nb-editor) alpha version file manager
  
I built nbfm to demonstrate a serverless collaborative notion-level note editor only using shared files. All the work is done alone, so the quality may not be perfect and may not be that great.
 But it holds the potential to become an all-in-one workspace where users have full data sovereignty. I strongly believe it is valuable in the era of A.I.

 repo
 This is a proof of concept/Prototype
 Almost a year ago, I started working on a GDScript compiler. And then stopped because getting GDExtensions to work (even in C) was a pain (because it&#x27;s not documented). This was my first time using rust, so the code was kinda bad. 
 I have revisited the project, but it&#x27;s a bit different now. Instead of using LLVM to generate machine code, I generate rust, because if I can use rust I will (even for shaders). 
 And with help of gdext, I won&#x27;t have to deal with GDExtensions.
 Benchmarks
 The rust version (without optimizations) can run 5 times faster in this case nth Fibonacci number.
  GDScript: 390 ms Rust: 77 ms 
 (Code for the benchmark can be seen in addon/bench.gd)
 Features
  
Function
 Calling functions in the same file
 Math
 for loops
 while loops
 if
 variables
 Addon
 maybe I missed something else
  
Limitations
  
Using other Nodes.
 calling function outside the file
 Can generate wrong rust code
 And a lot more
  
FAQ
 Why rust?
 I like it.
 Will this make normal GDScript obsolete?
 No, GDScript is really nice to debug. And fast to iterate.
 Why is GDScript slow?
 IMO, I think the main problem is loops, it&#x27;s something that any interpreted language fears.
 Why not make a JIT?
 While it will be better for dynamically typed language like GDScript, but it will be harder to implement. Oh, and JIT&#x27;s won&#x27;t work on IOS.
 Why not use rust or c++ direly
 Debug in Godot, run with rust. GDScript is easy to debug for normal people, for compiled languages you need to use lldb or gdb.
 Future
  
beg Godot devs for --script-dump-ast
 Better codegen (this that takes AST and makes rust source code)
 Improve the add-on.
  
I won&#x27;t be working on this for some time. Writing a parser is only fun the first time, not 2 times + other failed attempts with parser generators. Basically, nothing will be done until --script-dump-ast, and then maybe I will continue.
 Maybe this will revive this issue.

                              <span>A lot of reddit subs used to do that back in the day. I&#x27;m not sure why they died out, maybe it was a programming fad.
 I can&#x27;t help feeling it might be a good fit for the Godot community though. It allows more experienced devs to flex their muscles and show off, while more novice level people can take notes.
 I&#x27;m not talking about long challenges, such as making games/prototypes, but more specific stuff. 
 Here&#x27;s an example of Python challenges for comparison. That list goes from beginner level to hard, but there&#x27;s no reason we have to vary the difficulty by that much.

                              <span>Ok, hear me out, we can all have opinions on Zig-the-language (which I haven&#x27;t touched in months) but this isn&#x27;t about Zig-the-language, it&#x27;s the C compiler that comes embedded with Zig-the-toolchain: zig cc. If you ever had to cross-compile some C the traditional way, you know how painful it is. With zig cc it&#x27;s literally just a single flag away, -target $TRIPLE. That&#x27;s it. With QEMU user mode and WINE I can easily test my code for Windows and obscurer architectures all within a few minutes in a single terminal session. I don&#x27;t need to wonder whether my code works on 32-bit big-endian PowerPC or on i386 Windows because I can just check. It just feels like a better frontend to clang, imo.
 (Plus, zig cc also has nicer defaults, like a more debugger-friendly UBSan being enabled by default)

                              <span>Hello, I’m taking system programming course this semester and the final exam is a project presentation and I have no idea what to do. In class we are writing a multithreaded C++ code and we test it in windows wsl. Sometimes we use terminal commands in Linux(Ubuntu) for testing as well. The project should focus on multithreading, GPROF, GDB, time (in terminal), top and htop, iostat, vmstat, mpstat, sar: automated neparting, valgrind, perf, unit tests, and mutex. I submitted a proposal about encryption and image processing but both are occupied by other students and were rejected and I have one last chance for project proposal and I have no idea what should I do. Anyone have ideas other than the one’s that got rejected? The proposal should answer 3 questions (What, Why, How)

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently working on implementing Conway&#x27;s Game of Life in the terminal using C++, and I&#x27;ve encountered a challenge that has me stumped.
 As I dive into building the two-dimensional grid required for the game, I&#x27;m faced with a dilemma: should I use a 2-D array or vectors? My goal is to create a grid that can dynamically change its size during runtime, which rules out arrays due to their fixed size. After some research, I&#x27;ve learned that vectors in C++ offer the flexibility I need, allowing me to resize them on the fly.
 Despite dedicating hours to this endeavor, I&#x27;m finding the process of dynamically resizing the grid using vectors to be quite daunting. Specifically, I&#x27;m struggling to increase the size of the grid by (rows+2) x (columns+2) when certain conditions are met.
 If there&#x27;s anyone proficient in C++ who has experience with dynamic resizing of 2-D vectors, I would greatly appreciate any guidance, tips, or code snippets you could share to help me overcome this obstacle. Your assistance would be invaluable in bringing my Game of Life project to life!
 Thank you all in advance for your support and expertise.
 Thank YOU!

                              <span>Hello, ive been reading about poll and epoll and i think i dont really get why epoll is faster than poll, here is my current high level understanding:
 Poll: loops over a list of provided fds, calling a is_ready() fn and updating another list with the fds which is_ready() call returns true
 Epoll: registers all provided fds into a epoll fd, which on new events will wake up epoll_wait(), tho i dont know how does the event triggering works? i read on some high level explanation that its a dedicated thread that loops over the fds, so equiv to poll but it wouldnt make sense - then on new event, a list of ready fds is returned and the wait update its structure with the ready fds, user then just have to iterate over this list of ready fds
 i dont know if its clear, i hope so.
 man epoll() says this: 
 By contrast, when used as a level-triggered interface (the
 default, when EPOLLET is not specified), epoll is simply a faster
 , and can be used wherever the latter is used since it
 shares the same semantics.poll(2)
 I would like to know if my understanding of how poll detects ready fd is good, and how does epoll listen / triggers on new events, as well as why is level triggered epoll is faster than poll even if it seems to me that on level triggered mode epoll does the same as poll (iterates over fds and check if ready)
 thanks in advance for the help

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;m working with an STM32G070CB microcontroller and facing an issue where the USART2 interrupt isn&#x27;t being triggered after populating the TDR with the first byte. Despite configuring the USART with FIFO enabled and setting up the correct NVIC priorities, the data isn&#x27;t being transmitted, and the ISR isn&#x27;t called. I&#x27;ve checked the usual suspects like global interrupts, USART initialization, and error flags, but the problem persists. Here&#x27;s a brief overview of my setup: FIFO is enabled for USART2. NVIC is configured with the correct priority for USART2 interrupts. Global interrupts are enabled. USART2 is initialized with the correct settings (baud rate, word length, etc.). Hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) is enabled.

                              <span>Hi. Some time ago I was working on a python-like _Generic type-aware C11 printing library. The library is called YIO and the source is here https://gitlab.com/Kamcuk/yio . I have not been working on it for quite some time.
 My questions are: Do you see yourself using such a library if it is &quot;stable&quot; and working? Do you think it is worth spending time improving it?
 The library became my playground to discover a lot of stuff and there a lot of features. UTF-8 support, wide char, UTF-16 and UTF-32 support with libunistring, _Decimal printing, stdfix.h printing, struct tm formatting, full python format specifier support, monetary printing support, configurable multiple ways of printing floating point numbers - using strfromd or RYU library or my own implementation of floating point printing, …</span>

 dpointer[0] &#x3D; &quot;two&quot;;
 *dpointer &#x3D; &quot;three&quot;;
 In the above snippet of code, I get a segfault on the last two lines, both of them. Why?
 If I assign a string value to a regular pointer, no segfault takes place. So why does it happen when I do it with a double pointer?

                              <span>Legacy product, certain parts of it have a lot of test debt. The business risk from this test debt was raised by engineering, multiple multiple times. 
 There&#x27;s always a new priority that takes precedence over existing instability.
 
 One of the inadequately tested components had an issue that was indeterministic and discovered in prod. Not that we would&#x27;ve caught it even if it was deterministic, there is no/very little coverage for this.
  
But ___this___ time, it had enough visibility that leaders had to explain why this issue made it to prod.
 Rather than explain that this is a known issue and should&#x27;ve been/should be prioritized, I get pulled into the meeting and got the finger pointed at me
 I want to say something in my 1:1, essentially a professional version of &quot;wtf&quot; but the most possible outcome seems to be some form of retaliation from mgmt chain
 Should I be offended or am I overreacting? Is this common practice for upper mgmt and I should just roll with the punch?

                              <span>I was at 2 companies in the past 7 years.
 First company was bigtech. I kinda just cruised. I would ask for work, and literally my manager would be like *shrug. I never got any projects... never got any tasks... I literally did nothing for 2.5 years but simple bash scripts here and there.
 So I quit and joined another company. I got a bit more work here, more projects, etc. I was able to get a team of 2 junior engineers, we worked on projects here and there
 I didn&#x27;t &quot;grow&quot; because I was always the most senior.... I had nobody to get guidance or advice from.
 Whenever we built new projects, I basically &quot;architected&quot; it and built it with the team... but... it was 99.9% me teaching them stuff. I never really learned much I feel.
 Even simple basic things like... code standards, I just did what I felt like was the best. For our software design patterns, I used GoF stuff I learned from reading, where it SEEMED like it would be good, but I had no guidance or feedback! I architected a distributed system when we finally got a bigger project and while it worked and scaled, I have no idea if I did it &quot;right&quot;...
 Now that I&#x27;m laid off, and looking for a new job... I feel like a serious imposter during my interviews. A) I &quot;architected&quot; and &quot;standardized code on the team&quot; but... it was a team 3 and it feels like bullshit and I don&#x27;t really know anything. and B) When I get asked about design patterns... sure I &quot;know&quot; the patterns but... I have about as much experience APPLYING them as a newgrad....
 I feel like my 7 YOE knowledge is LESS than a 2YOE who worked on a big team with a senior engineer advising them

                              <span>We have this senior dev join us last year. Soon after they joined we learned that they overengineer and overcomplicate absolutely everything. They pushes back on every feedback they gets in the PRs with very very long responses, links to resources, etc. 
 We decided to let them work on a new initiative, so they could take their time to understand our process since there wasn’t a hard deadline on it. The project has become a deviant and a one-off where they didn’t follow any of the patterns we used on any of the other services. Basically you tell them, we need to do C and to get there we need to build A and B. He then goes and builds E, F, G, H and then finally C. You tell him that that’s not how we usually do things, and then they asks you to write the requirements for it, and they will make sure that C matches those requirements… I don’t think anyone else on the team would be able to contribute to this project or support it, which is almost like a legacy service being brand new.
 They don’t get involved in any of the other tasks the rest of the team does, but constantly requires time from everyone to review their PRs. They also started getting very involved with other teams organizing lunch and learns, presentations, discussions and trying to get buy-in from other teams in how they do things.
 This individual is a very smart person and I don’t doubt his technical skills.. but is really a pain to work with him. He seem to be very obsessed with the processes shared with other teams instead of anything related to us. I don’t know if he is trying to set himself up for a promotion or what, but it is becoming exhausting

                              <span>I can step through the logic but after attempting that on multiple occasions it seems like what is most persuasive is if other teams/people/companies are doing it. Are there published statistics or articles that make the case for things like standard scrums or anything of that sort?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve only been here for under a year but basically we had layoffs a few days ago. Anyways we had a big company wide meeting the same day and someone asked if there would be more layoffs and the guy basically said &quot;I definitely can&#x27;t promise there won&#x27;t be but I can say for the life of the company wether that&#x27;s 5, 10, 20, 100 years from now we will have many many more&quot;. 
 I also learned from some of my coworkers who have been here for 3 years that they&#x27;ve had layoffs every year. 
 The layoffs were not due to performance. They are always simply operational cost things aka your team is costing more than value so bye. 
 Idk it&#x27;s just so icky. I feel like I need to really work hard to avoid getting laid off. Like my job is always at risk and any day I might wake up and oh I got laid off lol. I get business is business but it&#x27;s just really fucking icky. 
 I really liked this job but now I&#x27;m just icked tf out.

                              <span>I have been working about 10 years at larger tech companies and joined my first startup (a late stage one) several months ago as a Staff dev.
 When I was interviewing they had told me that I would receive X # of options at some strike price and so I negotiated heavily for more options in my package. Little did I know, they were about to announce a funding round, invalidating the previous strike price and the strike price that I would receive has tripled (which I have not yet been granted). Sure I still get X # options however they are now at 3x the strike price. This means that instead of paying say $200k to exercise my options I have to pay $600k if I ever want to exercise (with the risk that it becomes potentially be worthless if it never IPOs).
 Given that I don&#x27;t see the company realistically going IPO until at least 5+ years, this means if I leave before then I will have to either shell out a large amount of money or just leave my stake on the table. If I just leave it on the table then it only makes financial sense for me to stay at the company the amount of time equal to the amount of options I am willing to exercise.
 Has anyone else joined in the middle of a raise unknowingly and are there other solutions? Has anyone tried to renegotiate their offer package after joining since grants haven&#x27;t been issued?

You can also generalize some of your answers (e.g. &quot;Biotech company&quot; or &quot;Hideously Overvalued Unicorn&quot;), or add fields if you feel something is particularly relevant.

                              <span>How much is too much? Is writing down the deployment process for each project we manage to much when all the deployment processes are the same? We have 2 Devops guys, myself being one and the other one who know the deployment process and its rather simple. Is there a need to document every single thing? Trying to find the balance of just enough documentation without over documenting things when i know it may not be really referenced. 
 What is your take on internal documentation for your team - at least when it comes to reference things. Do you also have documentation which is used to help developers whenever they get stuck an issue?

                              <span>It took me a while to figure out how to fully get the most out of kubectl (mainly combining it with useful plugins and complimentary k8s tooling) Since none of this was intuitive when I started learning to interface with k8s clusters through kubectl I wrote up a summary of what I have learned so far. Hopefully it might be useful to others.

 I&#x27;m a rather new IT architect with a software development background of 10 years.
 I work for a university and when I joined, we had one young devops guy who maintained all our stuff, we have a docker swarm and he knew docker well, git well and linux well. 
 Our 3 in-house devs only wrote code, they knew very little about Docker and this one devops guy managed everything after the devs pushed their code. 
 We then hired one more, they were both quite decent and covered everything and when I joined, I had a lot to learn and to do so I didn&#x27;t have time to get into that topic.
 But then they both left and we hired 2 new ones. They were also not the most experienced, but had about 5 years of experience and seemed smart and interested and knew linux etc. 
 And both have been solving th…</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1clp9x7/removed_my_linkedin_profile_picture_now/">

                              <span>So recently I decided I was going to replace my LinkedIn profile pic since my current one is outdated. While I hadn&#x27;t yet replaced it I left it blank and suddenly received 2 unsolicited messages from recruiters and 2 responses from other job listings in the span of 1 week. For context, I had spent 6 months and ~800 job apps which I know isn&#x27;t that many but I haven&#x27;t even gotten a phone screen. My last and only interview was 6 months ago, where I made it to the final round and was rejected because they had an applicant with more experience than me (I had over 2 YOE and it was a junior role FML). 
 Anyway I&#x27;m starting to question the timing of these recruiter messages. I don&#x27;t think there was anything wrong with my profile picture. The only critique I could think of is that it was a bit outdated so I might have looked too young. I don&#x27;t really want this to turn into a r/RoastMe post so just bear with me and assume I am just an average looking person. 
 I think the more likely scenario is that there is some algorithm that LinkedIn uses that detects when users become less engaged on the platform and then decides to rapidly promote that user into reengaging again. This may come across as tinfoil hatty but I do think this is the most likely outcome since the timing does not make any sense and I haven&#x27;t read anything to suggest the job market suddenly improved a ton. I am curious if other people have had similar things happen to them like this.
 Also an FYI I am a White Male U.S. Citizen with 2.5 YOE in a popular tech stack in a west coast city.

                              <span>I have an internship coming up and I’m trying to schedule a flight a month from now right after work hours, but the most convenient time for me is 6pm which is an hour after work and it takes me an hour to get to the airport, so I’m thinking of asking to leave an hour before the end of the day. Would this be a red flag or is this common and ok to do at an internship? I have my managers contact information but afraid asking for time off before I even started is a red flag.

                              <span>When I started getting interested in programming, I got sucked in by the Rust hype and decided to learn it as my first language. I am currently on chapter 15 on the book, and I think I have a good understanding of the stuff I read up to that point. However, when I try to program anything real, I get very overwhelmed and can&#x27;t seem to figure things out. I feel as if the libraries I see are either too abstracted to teach me anything about Rust itself, and I have to learn about the library. Or, things are complicated and I see crazy patterns that take me a long time to figure out. What projects can I write to teach me fundamentals?

                              <span>I&#x27;m hoping that I&#x27;m doing something wrong because creating new mocks in existing code really sucks.
  
create interface for your struct (already really damn tedious)
 refactor code so that the mocked struct is now passed into your unit either through argument or through parent struct (this can be miserable)
 find the previous mockgen command, append the new mock to it, run (surely there is a better way)
  
Also is there no way to mock a function that is not a method? Or what if a function call is hardcoded into the unit you are trying to test. What would you do then?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am looking for a free IDE that would allow me to debug golang code. I used GoLand when EAP was available but they removed this possibility now (not a criticism, just stating the fact they did). I found that useful especially for running in debug
 Emphasis on free as is for my personal machine. I have a work machine and have a full intellij license but seldom use go at work (one of the motivation to do personal projects and set up my personal machine)
 My personal machine runs linux if relevant

                              <span>Sometimes I see the following scenario:
 Playtester: The movement feels very stiff.
 Dev: Oh yeah that&#x27;s intentional because this game was inspired by Resident Evil 1.
 Your playtester is giving you honest feedback. The best thing to do is take notes. You know who isn&#x27;t going to care about the &quot;design&quot; excuse? The person who leaves a negative review on Steam complaining about the same issues. The best outcome is that your playtester comes to that conclusion themselves.
 Playtester: &quot;The movement feels very stiff, but those restrictions make the moment-to-moment gameplay more intense. Kind of reminds me of Resident Evil 1, actually.&quot;
 That&#x27;s not to say you should take every piece of feedback to heart. Absolutely not. If you truly believe clunky movement is part of the experience and you can&#x27;t do without it, then you&#x27;ll just have to accept that the game&#x27;s not for everyone.
 The best feedback is given when you don&#x27;t tell your playtester what to think or feel about what they&#x27;re playing. Just let them experience the game how a regular player would.

                              <span>Is the player actually placing realtime lights all over the place or are they doing some masked off light map trickery? I&#x27;m really curious how they did it and I can seem to find any resources detailing the technique they used.

                              <span>From what I understand Twitter and Facebook are full of bots and politics(more so than before) and most sub reddits have rules about no self-promotion(which I like and think is a good thing). Sub reddits that don&#x27;t have these rules tend to be very low quality constant spam that only contain other devs, who are not your target audience. I do like those subs just for personal validation and talking about our projects as I have no one in real life to do so with, but anyways.
 Where do you find your audience now, on tik tok or something else? I am not a social media or marketing type of guy, but eventually I&#x27;ll want to let people know my game exists, where is the best place to start? I understand it&#x27;s not easy and I don&#x27;t expect it to be and it&#x27;ll be yet another skill to add to the list, but I&#x27;d like to know your opinions on where to go.

                              <span>Assuming we have a vulnerable c program and we found a buffer overflow vulnerability on the program and created an exploit on that. Can the same exploit be executed if the vulnerable c program runs on a different machine? Will memory addresses be the same?
 I think the answer is no they probably won´t even be the same when running only in the same environment and on the same machine. There is nothing like a guarantee that it will have the same address.
 A modern-day OS assigns the memory arbitrarily (within certain sections of course). This technique is called Address Space Layout Randomization. Also gcc or clang uses the --fstack-protector that prevents buffer overflow attacks
 Hence, my final question confuses me and make no sense for me based on this video is how geohot manage to exploit a buffer overflow attack remotely if addresses would not the same. He first did it locally and then remotely. How does he manage to achieve it?

                              <span>I was messing around on wifite and ran some scans. I saw a file in my hs directory that was titled reaver_output.hcap. I decided to take a look and used tcpdump -r  and saw the names of devices from my own local network specifically my printer. I wasn&#x27;t using wifite on my own network and never used reader. This seems very odd to me. It was placed in my home directory. Where I put other caps when running wifite. I checked the birth date of the file and it was created exactly when i was using wifite. 
 Has any one experienced this or could tell me why packets from my own local network were captured and then the file titled after a program I wasn&#x27;t using?

                              <span>Generating passwords for cracking is pretty common. But say you have 1k password attempts and that&#x27;s your limit. 
 What&#x27;s your golden rule for generating a custom word list for a target? Whether it&#x27;s an individual or organization. I.e first.last first.last etc.

                              <span>Hi, I write a small tool to print process memory usages, memory mappings and real-time process network connections. Those information could be important when debugging OOM situation because it is hard to collect those data once the process is killed. Users can use this to collect process information on a suspicious OOM process and once the process is killed then users can use the data that memdoor collected to debug what&#x27;s going on.

                              <span>A few weeks ago, I posted about a port of DirectX12 HelloTriangle official example to C. I&#x27;m working on the other examples and you can check them here: https://github.com/simstim-star/DirectX-Graphics-Samples-in-C
 Currently, I&#x27;ve only ported HelloTriangle, HelloBundles, HelloConstBuffers, HelloFrameBuffering, HelloTexture and HelloVADecode, but I intend to work on as many as I can. 
 Also, I&#x27;m working on porting DirectX-Headers to C, as they are necessary for the samples, but it is still a bit raw, as I&#x27;m developing them on an as-needed basis. This port is on this repo: https://github.com/simstim-star/DirectX-Headers-in-C

                              <span>Is it true that it is faster to sum an array of doubles by summing the numbers at even induces, then the ones at odd invoices, then adding the two results? If so, why?

                              <span>I&#x27;m still learning here. 
 I&#x27;m running latest kali linux on a legion 7, vmbox. Im using a Brostrend A1 network adapter.
 I&#x27;ve put it into monitor mode successfully with &#x27;airmon-ng check kill&#x27; + &#x27;airmon-ng start wlan0&#x27;. I can run &#x27;airodump-ng wlan0&#x27; (my adapter doesn&#x27;t change to wlan0mon, for some reason, despite an iwconfig showing it in monitor mode). I&#x27;m able to catch all kinds of aps and clients, bssid&#x27;s. 
 Okay so I captured my target bssid, I then ran airodump again to find my target clients. I&#x27;m pretty sure my phone is hiding it&#x27;s Mac address, because it doesn&#x27;t show up under 2.4 or 5ghz packet capture. But despite that I&#x27;m sitting with my whole family and no ones showing as being kicked off when I run aireplay-ng. When I run this I&#x27;ve tried deauth against just the full AP, but I&#x27;ve also tried several device Mac addresses that are showing up. It actually runs the deauth successfully. I&#x27;m seeing ack results. But yeah despite trying maybe 5 or 6 times on different networks and devices. It&#x27;ll run, but it won&#x27;t kick anyone off. 
 Any ideas? I can post some blurred out shots

                              <span>I&#x27;m acquainted with great code bases that heavily use Yaml, so I&#x27;m not really sure why other people dislike it. Spring Boot was my introduction, so it might be because I&#x27;ve only ever had good documentation when working with it, but when I see it used for K8s, I have no complaints. What&#x27;s the better alternative that people like using? (I&#x27;m particularly looking to hear from people who hate dealing with Yaml)

                              <span>I have been using Hashicorp Packer for creating QEMU / VMware OVMF images. With all the potential rug pulling and the subsequent forks of Hashicorp products, is there actually a fork for Packer?
 QEMU with command-line is quite verbose and tedious and I found the wrapper of HCL via Packer a bit more configuration friendly.
 If there is no fork, what are other tools being used to create such VM images in the OSS world?

                              <span>If you&#x27;re writing a Dockerfile to be executed within a CI/CD pipeline (Setup -&gt; Build -&gt; Analyze -&gt; Build Container -&gt; Deploy), would you prefer installing dependencies and building the application separately, or reusing the artifact from the previous build job? To me, the latter seems obvious, but I&#x27;ve only seen the former approach used so far.

                              <span>Apologies upfront for the long post. I&#x27;m going through some existential crisis and just felt like writing it out.
 I&#x27;ve been a developer for around 14-15 years and have worked on a lot of different tech and systems and have a good breadth of knowledge i&#x27;d say. 
 But i&#x27;ve never really worked on anything with huge amounts of data or low latency requirements or extremely high throughout etc. Have always worked in big orgs and on systems with moderate non-functional specs and lots of business features. Historically i&#x27;ve not been into developer communities or open source contributions (earlier in career due to lack of awareness and now due all sorts of stuff including lack of motivation to do this outside work hours). I&#x27;m trying to change this a bit recently by getting more involved in communities in my company.
 Having said that within my teams i&#x27;ve always got good remarks, hikes and considered as a solid all-round senior. Pay was always good and I mostly enjoyed my work (was almost too grateful to even be hired as a SWE at the start). I also keep myself quite updated even though most of that knowledge stays mostly theoretical.
 As I evaluate my career i wonder if I should have seeked out more challenging work? There seems to be an expectation that after all these years one would have atleast tackled some hard technical challenge and I cant seem to think of any. Slowly starting to feel if i&#x27;m actually good to even handle anything challenging now and that&#x27;s not helping my confidence to even look for such opportunities. What if I get an opportunity and fail?
 Just wondering if others have gone through such a phase and found their peace somehow? Or any advice on how to position myself for the next 15 years of my career?

                              <span>Maybe a better thing to ask would be: how do you ensure you’re recognized for the products of your work?
 I’ve had a strange problem for a while now: despite putting in the same hours as my coworkers, and being very productive in terms of tickets, I have for years now been receiving the feedback that I should work with more urgency, and should try to get things done faster. I genuinely do not slack off at all, but the fact that I keep receiving this feedback (and that it has followed me between companies) indicates to me that I’m clearly at least doing a poor job of representing myself.
 For example: once, after a particularly rough sprint a manager had a version of this conversation with me, and we pulled up metrics, and over the course of that sprint I’d completed more tickets than anyone else on the team, and had completed the same number of “urgent” tickets as the rest of the team combined. (And it’s not as though I just pick easy tickets to pump my numbers)
 In one-off situations like that it’s easy to be like, look, I’m sorry I’m giving off this appearance, but if we look at the actual work that got done I think it’s clear I’m pulling my weight… but it’s really not a conversation I enjoy having over and over. Instead I’d really like to just not give off that appearance in the first place.

                              <span>Hey all. So going to jump right in I&#x27;ve been inthe same role with the same place since I started being a software dev just under 8 years ago fresh out of a bootcamp. Without being too much a whiner I&#x27;ll explain
 1.hired in at too high a role. There was one right below the position I was hired in that I didn&#x27;t even know existed until a few years later which would have been more appropriate, but I made it through.
 2. This one is the most awkward but basically I had a manager who had a terrible rep for not promoting/supporting his female subordinates (which is someone else I didn&#x27;t find out until much later and after the guy got laid off)
 3. Covid was weird for my company so no a lot of promotions going on for that first year or so.
 4. My spouse died very suddenly 2 years ago and I discovered him (hard story, sorry) and, as you can imagine, that first year or so after I wasn&#x27;t super focused on career development. 
 So now I&#x27;m living in a different place and am thinking about switching up roles at a new company but I don&#x27;t really know how to plan out my resume. I know the market is hard enough as it is right now so I need all the advice I can get. Thanks all!

                              <span>I&#x27;m the lead for a small team (5 devs), we do upgrades and new features to a set of analysis tools for a couple of customers that we have been working with for years. A junior dev suggested we implement a set of features on our current project that we had done on the last. I explained to him that we didn&#x27;t have requirements for that and because of differences in the implementation, they wouldn&#x27;t really work for this customer.
 On Friday he emailed the customer and asked them if they were planning on flowing us new requirements for the features that we discussed because it would make the tool much better. He didn&#x27;t copy me, but the customer emailed back, copying me, and said they were considering it. I replied that we could discuss it, but gave the reasons why it wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea for them.
 They also copied our management and our director came and yelled at me for &quot;requirements fishing&quot; - someone at the customer felt we were trying to increase the scope to inflate the contract value. To be honest, my reply wasn&#x27;t the best (I didn&#x27;t think it through enough and I can see why they might have thought we were coordinating)
 I&#x27;m pissed, if I were management, I&#x27;d fire him. To top it off, I think he realized that it&#x27;s coming back on him, he disappeared and I couldn&#x27;t find him Friday afternoon. I&#x27;ve got to do damage control with management on Monday - how would you handle this?

                              <span>Long story short I&#x27;m in the early stages of my career, I&#x27;m a generalist so I do sculpting, to retopo, materials, animations. Then I do vfx shaders in hlsls and the material editor in ue5 for animated fx on materials, I do a lot of complicated stuff with niagara scripting my own modules and things so they react to audio or aniamte how I need or react how I need.
 Then I do blueprint and some c++ which is still my weak point but I&#x27;m learning and I understand it quite well.
 I work with houdini for some things but overall I delve into a lot of different skill sets to accomplish so much since I&#x27;m usually the only developer being hired for my clients projects.
 Now this isn&#x27;t an issue since I&#x27;m very passionate about all of it and I&#x27;m really in love with code at the minute.

Any thoughts on the fiasco from the business side or game design side? Perhaps could anyone give some insights as to why a dev would promote something like this?

                              <span>I recently released one of my old puzzle games on Steam for fun. Since then, I&#x27;ve gotten emails almost daily from &quot;Streamers&quot; who are asking for a free Steam key. They almost always say something along the lines of &quot;I haven&#x27;t streamed in a long time but I am wanting to get back into. I heard about your game from a friend and it seems perfect!&quot; and then link to a twitch profile that has been inactive for two years.
 I know that these are likely bots/scammers looking for free steam keys to resell. My game is 2 bucks though...

Yeah, i would recommend not launching a steam page if you are intent on looking for a publisher, as the steam page launch is generally a pretty big marketing beat that they&#x27;d want some control over.
  
We&#x27;ve been working on a game that we intend to get a publisher for. Our plan was to launch a steam page soon because I heard somewhere way in the past that before you even pitch to publishers, you must provide proof that people are interested in your game. I&#x27;ve read that some even had to have successful Kickstarter campaigns before big publishers took them seriously.
 So I&#x27;d like to ask people here who have experienced having their game picked up by publishers, is that really the case?

                              <span>During an interview a while back, I was asked what the Pillars of Game Design are. I was curious what other developers thought about this question. It feels like it is dependent on the type of game you are making i.e. multiplayer, single player, coop, open world, shooter, rpg, action adventure, survival horror, etc.
 But I certainly could be wrong. Maybe there is a best/universal/one size fits all answer here. Is there a gold standard of game design knowledge that I am missing here?

                              <span>I was doing some market research for my next game and came upon those two games:
  
Vojo: price: 0.99$, released in march 2022, currently has 237 reviews.
 
SIZIF: price: 0.99$, released in july 2023, currently has 13 reviews.
 
 Both games are endless runners with a minimalistic style, they have the same features, are both the dev’s first game, have good reviews, and have very little coverage on youtube and other social medias.
 So why do you think one has almost 20 times more reviews than the other? I am genuinely curious because it doesn’t really make any sense to me…

 The market is bad and it&#x27;s hard to get a job. But this isn&#x27;t unique to tech. A majority of skilled jobs are hard to get right now besides traditionally stable fields like medicine or accounting. Go into any other career reddit and it&#x27;s the same issue. The amount of posts I see about people regretting getting into CS, thinking of switching majors, or just dropping out of college are so near sighted. And fair enough, you want to know your effort is worthwhile. But don&#x27;t romanticise the job market for everyone else.Just about EVERYONE has it bad right now. Unless you want to specifi…</span>

                              <span>I know entry level web developers are over saturated, but is every tech job like this? Such as cybersecurity, data analyst, informational systems analyst, etc. Would someone who got a 4 year degree from a college have a really hard time breaking into the field??

                              <span>Hello everyone, i&#x27;m currently having some issue with Rust, where after each change I make rust recompiles all dependencies. I&#x27;ve found some post on this topic on stackoverflow, but unfortunately the solutions didn&#x27;t helped in my case or maybe I misunderstood something while trying them out, so I came here to post my issue.
 use bevy::prelude::*; fn main() { App::new() .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins) .add_systems(Update, file_drag_and_drop_system) .run(); } fn file_drag_and_drop_system(mut events: EventReader) { for event in events.read() { info!(&quot;{:? }&quot;, event); } } 
 I simply add an addition space after the ? character in the file_drag_and_drop_system function. Then press ctrl + s to save the change and after that use cargo run / cargo build. In both cases cargo recompiles all dependencies.
 The things I&#x27;ve tried so far:
  
Some people suggested, that the problem is that the build incremental isn&#x27;t set to true.
 Others said, that setting the CARGO_TARGET_DIR environmental variable to a different folder might solve the problem.
  
config.toml in .cargo folder
 Prior to my issue I also set up the cargo.toml file after the Bevy getting started guide.
 [package] name &#x3D; &quot;bevy_01&quot; version &#x3D; &quot;0.1.0&quot; edition &#x3D; &quot;2021&quot; [workspace] resolver &#x3D; &quot;2&quot; # Important! wgpu/Bevy needs this! # NOTE: Remember to remove &quot;dynamic_linking&quot; before releasing your game! # Otherwise you will need to include libbevy_dylib alongside your game if you want it to run. # If you remove the &quot;dynamic&quot; feature, your game executable can run standalone. [dependencies] bevy &#x3D; { version &#x3D; &#x27;0.13&#x27;, features &#x3D; [&quot;dynamic_linking&quot;] } # Enable a small amount of optimization in debug mode [profile.dev] opt-level &#x3D; 1 # Enable high optimizations for dependencies (incl. Bevy), but not for our code: [profile.dev.package.&quot;*&quot;] opt-level &#x3D; 3 
 I&#x27;m using VSCode with Rust Analyzer on Windows 10, Rust version v1.79.0-nightly
 Thanks in advance for any help

                              <span>I use React.js for building web UIs, It&#x27;s OK but i would much rather write Go. I tend to dislike programming with js, especially with large projects for a variety of reasons, like slow lsp, large imports section, lot&#x27;s of dependencies, lack of useful primitives, bad error handeling.
 React.js makes it easy to manipulate the page however you want, also it has a lot of component libraries that handle stuff like animations and certain behaviors. 
 I heard there is htmx but apparently, it&#x27;s supposed to be an ajax library, i don&#x27;t mind doing fetches and writing javascript for that (much prefer it actually since there is a ton of stuff i would do when i ajax in case of errors, retries, signal abortion...). The javascript i hate writing is usually the dom manipulation javascript that you use to do something in the page. Is there something that handles this stuff that works with Go?

                              <span>Been looking a lot lately into what charm has been doing with bubbletea for the TUI component and wish for the server component. Didn&#x27;t see a good example on how to use the public key passed from the ssh server into the bubbletea app so I made one myself. General idea is to use one&#x27;s public key over ssh as a user identifier and then assign user roles to gate off content. 
 You can check the repo out here: https://gitlab.com/rdubwiley/texty
 Hope it&#x27;s useful if someone wants ideas on how to expose their TUI to the web or if someone is thinking of different ways to need user authentication for their ssh app.

                              <span>I am currently working on a RISC-V emulator. The requirement is that emulator should achieve near native performance. I am new to emulator programming. I have written an emulator for Gameboy, there I did instruction emulation by brute force ( writing functions for each instruction), which adds lot of performance overhead. I am wondering if there are some emulation techniques which might be useful to speed up the emulation.

 I wanted to reach out to the community for some guidance. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping to get
  
Any websites, tutorials, or online courses you highly recommend for learning about x86 architecture, ARM architecture, and the translation process itself would be fantastic!
 
Articles or white papers that provide a clear explanation of the different translation techniques (emulation vs static translation) would be super helpful.
 
If there are any must-read books on this topic, please point me in the right direction! I&#x27;m open to both beginner-friendly introductions and more advanced texts for when I get comfortable with the basics.
 
 Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>You probably have seen those ads where the player&#x27;s character shoots at enemies and objects on a 2D road. The player deliberately makes incorrect choices to entice you to play the game, but the ad is fake and the game is a pay-to-play base-building a la Clash of Clans.
 So what are those ads? If I were to guess, they are games thrown together in 15 minutes in a game engine like Unity just to make the ad. Would I be correct?

                              <span>This is obviously super suggestive, but do others struggle with creating good UI compared to well executed gameplay mechanics and level design? Not sure if I just don’t have an eye for it but creating good UI is always a struggle. Any UI masters in this community, please share some useful tips if possible.

 What polish do you prioritise, especially when time limited? We often talk about things in general terms on here, but what about specific details?
 For me, I lean towards music and sound effects. It&#x27;s often something I don&#x27;t bother too much with until the end of a project. Probably because it&#x27;s the field I&#x27;m least knowledgeable about.

                              <span>Hi,
 When someone can mostly go into small indies instead of big gamedev corporations like Ubisoft or EA, is getting laid off or getting fired so frequent? 
 Is here anybody, who only worked for small indie companies (with less than 10 people), and get constantly laid off or fired after maximum 2 years? 
 Is here anybody, who could work for one small startup-like indie company for more than 3 years as a programmer?

 I remember seeing posts on this sub not too long ago about people complaining that they had too little work to do while making 250k TC and working remotely from their fishing boat. Now, the posts have transitioned from the market being terrible to FAANG offshoring/outsourcing jobs, DEI/race wars, and class action lawsuits against bootcamps.
 Man, this place is really something else.

 Being the nosy person I am, I want to know which company you worked at that was pretty bad, if any.

                              <span>I’ve increasingly seen companies say they won’t hire junior developers because they waste time and money training them for them to just leave.
 There’s something really sick to me on a fundamental level about the idea of people leaving a job after a few years to go from $160k to $180k. It’s hard for me to personally justify being a part of such a huge class divide. 
 Edit: guys I’m not saying juniors are getting paid that. That’s an example of my friend who sent from senior to staff. It’s just an example of “person getting paid 6 figures leaves job to get paid slightly more 6 figures” and how casual it is would be unfathomable to most Americans, and you’re all showing how out of touch you are by ignoring the point and focusing on the numbers lmao.
 I’m not blaming anyone who jumps jobs (I wish we could hop jobs all the time it’s our right as workers) I’m just curious to have a discussion if anyone else feels the same. But I’m already exhausted of Reddit after 10 comments lmao. It is impossible to have a good faith discussion on the internet 😂😂

                              <span>My girlfriend (a non-programmer) recently asked me what it means when programmers say that &quot;everything is just binary under the hood&quot;. I started telling her how files don&#x27;t intrinsically &quot;mean&quot; something and that programs simply do something with the bytes.
 For instance, an image utility assumes that if there is a file.png somewhere and its internal binary layout follows the PNG conventions then it must be an image and it will display that image on screen interpreting the bytes as RGBA values. However, other programs may interpret these same bytes differently and do other things with them.
 To demo that concept in the most obvious way, I created snapsound - a CLI (for now) that allows you to transform any MP3 file into a PNG image but retain the ability to play back the original sound. It&#x27;s as simple as
 snapsound snap song.mp3 # Creates song.png snapsound play song.png 
 If you&#x27;re curious, the code is completely open source on GitHub. It can be easily installed with go intall.
 As a summation of this little research effort, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it is to write a program that plays sound in Go! The only thing is, I think that github.com/gopxl/beep (one of the deps) requires CGo to build on Linux, but MacOS and Windows are pure Go, no need for anything else (already tested both).

                              <span>I am a seasoned engineer with experience with more than one language and lately I am learning go. I am all in.
 One thing I am still getting used to is how the file system API is designed, I might get used to it with time, but for the moment it feels a bit sparse.
 You have os for most things, filepath surprisingly has a Glob function, then a bunch of things implementing io.Reader and io.Writer and so on.
 I tried very hard for weeks to not write to disk in my tests, but it sounds borderline an antipattern at this point. I would have to create a specific struct with all my functionality and a mock for it.
 What I am used to, and thought was a good design, was to have all fs methods to take a fs instance and given that go does do that for few things I was confused when I don&#x27;t see that as just &quot;the way to do it&quot;.
 Also, os.DirFS is admittedly broken for things that require dynamic paths or cross os compat, which makes it hard to use things like MapFS in your tests (MapFS looks so good on paper).
 Is there something I need to learn about this to get more comfortable or did I get to the same conclusion as everyone else?

                              <span>Only thing I ever did is Competitive programming using C++, although I can write code in python too. I wanted to learn development(Server side to be precise) but I feel like everyone is doing NodeJS,Django etc at this point, so I wanted to learn something different. Should I proceed with Go at this point for development ( I heard its good for server side development) or should I stick with more traditional options. Also at later point I want a job too.

                              <span>As a beginner what all projects you build that helped you get good at concurrency in Go ?
 What all resources you looked into ?
 I&#x27;m a beginner learning Go and wanted to get good at concurrency and build projects.
 Do share repos that i can look into to learn this. I&#x27;m having hard time reading big repositories. So small projects would be helpful. 
 Thank you. 
 Btw Go is my first programming language!

                              <span>I&#x27;m not a big guy on &quot;personal projects&quot; but I&#x27;m trying to change that, so i started working on a spaceInvaders emulator in rust and after i spent a good 10 hours ( I&#x27;m slow :p ) implementing all opcodes and making sure they work correctly i noticed that I&#x27;ll need to change it all, so i wanted to ask. How do you guys usually imagine your code structure beforehand in detail and cleanly. cuz im noticing that I have the same issue at work my philosophy is to think about the task good enough then start implementing as fast as possible so that if I fail, I fail fast and have time to recover, because in my mind there are stuff I wont be able to predict no matter how long I think about it, but my issue is that the amount of things that I cant predict is a lot more than what other developers cant predict, one of those things is overall structure for example (as simple as it may be :) ), so how do you guys approach this sort of tasks, and if you have any advice on how to improve it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been living in a VHCOL city on the west coast for the past few years, working as a software engineer. My company has an office out here, but announced recently they&#x27;re closing it at the end of the month, after which I&#x27;ll be fully remote.
 I don&#x27;t particularly care for the city I live in, and thought that remote work would be a great opportunity to move to a larger city with more energy, namely NYC. I&#x27;ve been floating this idea around my team since the announcement of the closure was made, and haven&#x27;t gotten any negative feedback around it, so I felt pretty confident about the topic when I officially asked my boss if I could move to NYC after I become fully remote.
 He got back to me a few days later (after speaking with HR), and said that a move is totally doable, if I take a $50k pay cut in my TC. I was pretty floored at this request, especially since by any metric NYC is more expensive than where I currently live, but the rationale is that the pay bands in NYC are ostensibly lower for my job compared to my current city.
 I&#x27;m wondering, is this level of pay cut common for a move from the west coast to NYC? It seems totally unreasonable to me, especially after looking at jobs at some of the other tech companies operating out of NYC. Many of these companies actually explicitly state that their pay bands are identical for NYC and the city I live in currently. Does anyone has experience with this kind of move?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;ve been planning my work not just around my calendar but also how difficult the work im trying to do may be. For example, 8 hours of coding in one day is half as productive as 4 hours one day and another 4 hours the next. So I try to spend half a day coding and half a day writing, networking, and applying to jobs. Sometimes reading fits into this but for material that&#x27;s particularly challenging or math heavy I may dedicate a coding day to that material.
 What makes this tricky is some days my brain works better than others, and it&#x27;s not entirely predictable. I coded for 12 hours straight on Thursday because I noticed I was having a &quot;good brain day,&quot; but Friday passed and it&#x27;s now Saturday and I barely have enough brain juice to write this reddit post.
 I&#x27;m curious if other people plan their work around things like this and what tips/tricks they may have!

The problem is he (we&#x27;ll call him Brian) is getting away with doing almost nothing at all. I mean could-be-working-a-second-job brazen time theft. Brian doesn&#x27;t contribute to our regular sprint tasks whatsoever, but has the tenure and trust to work on larger abstract &quot;big picture&quot; items that are perpetually in progress and he always seems to run into blockers with. There. Is. Always. A. Blocker. He&#x27;s literally a black hole on the team in terms of output.

                              <span>I heard this metaphor a long time ago. I forget where and from whom. I also forget exactly how it went, but the basic idea was this. Developers are going to want to build their sandcastles. And the idea I think it was trying to express was the desire of software developerss to build the most complete, robust, and elegant solutions they could engineer for the problems they are trying to solve.
 Sometimes this may be good, but the context I think I remember the metaphor in was that of, &quot;project managers are necessary otherwise develops will never make progress towards a end goal, with endless scope creep and analysis paralysis&quot;. Thinking about it now, I think this metaphor was being used in reference to the video game industry when I heard it.
 This post is two part, firstly, and mostly for my curiosity, I was hoping you all who are familiar with this expression could remind me exactly how it goes and provide your take on it.
 Secondly, I would like to start a discussion on the topic. At work, I don&#x27;t really seem to face this issue that often. But when working on a personal project, I seem to almost never get very far because I get stuck in this trance where I am trying to over engineer the first problems I come across with any amount of complexity. For example, I have tried writing a vulkan renderer multiple times now, and each time I get stuck on trying to build a thesis on device and queue selection, coding for every use case that I can imagine, when in reality I only need one or two simple methods for accomplishing this task. So, have any of you also ever struggled with this, and what are some good ways to work around this?

                              <span>I saw this company&#x27;s website, where they claim to provide &quot;a specialized high-performance managed-cloud&quot; with 100% SLA. They have a cloud hosting SLA page, where they state that customers are not eligible for compensation in circumstances beyond their reasonable control. Those are:
  
scheduled maintenance, emergency maintenance, upgrades
 force majeure events, interrupts/delays in telecommunications or third party services
 targeted attacks
 ...
  
I don&#x27;t fully grasp the concept of SLA yet, but it feels that they just excluded all the possible conditions for downtime, to be able to claim 100% uptime. It looks even worse because they look like &quot;resellers&quot;, in the sense that they are offering you a managed experience of somebody else&#x27;s cloud (companies can do that?), and then they exclude third party interrupts/delays. 
 What do you think of this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started learning rust, and for the most part when i have done short coding challanges and parsing of data i seem to be able to make the code work properly (after some compiler error fixes). Most short scripts didnt require any use of lifetimes.
 When i try to get into writing my own structs and enums, the moment that the data access isn&#x27;t trivial (like immutable linked list over a generic type) i hit a wall with the many smart pointer types and which one to use (and when to just use the &amp; reference), and how to think of lifetimes when i write it. Moreover, the compiler errors and suggestions tend to be cyclic and not lead to fixing the code.
 If anyone has some tips on how to approach annotating lifetimes and in general resources on lifetimes and references for beginners i would very much appreciate sharing them.

                              <span>I switched my primary language from C/C++ to rust around 5 years back. I have been interviewing lately for a job change. Most of the interviews were 45 min affairs, solving Leetcode style problems (why ?? - that is a separate discussion).
 Sadly, I have come to realize rust is not ideal for this scenario, and going to switch back to C for these coding rounds. Most of these interviews involved working with 2D arrays, linked list, binary trees and such which would be relatively simple in C/C++.
 More context: I have had to spend a good part of the 45 min setting up these primitives, before even trying to solve the core algorithmic challenge. Few reasons:
  
Things like coderpad don&#x27;t let you use external crates (e.g) there is one for 2D arrays
 Some questions involve removing elements from middle of lists in O(1) time. I had to hand roll a doubly linked list with unsafe pointer usage to achieve that, which itself easily filled the time
  
With C/C++, these interviews used to go lot better, uh. Now I think: use C/C++ for interviews, rust for product development. Any thoughts?

 What will you do then?
 I&#x27;ll get into homesteading and alpaca husbandry. Away from the city, away from the industrial chaos corrupting our minds - to a good life of harvesting mushrooms and knitting alpaca socks. Might also get into archeology like i wanted as a child.

On a curious glance, I looked at a Linux course on udemy last week, I&#x27;ve been using Linux for years so didn&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;d learn a bunch. It was amazing! So much interesting stuff I&#x27;d never come across before.

                              <span>I’ve been exploring the CDK space recently and started looking more into Pulumi. I have read some absolute nightmares of the migration from Terraform, but I’m curious if anyone has had a pleasant experience? I was intrigued by the YAML abilities as we provide a lot of self service modules for developers. Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts

                              <span>I have switched to using C# instead of GDScript for a few months now, and here is what I have learned that I wish I had known earlier, in case anyone here is looking to try C# for their project.
  
You can use the latest stable version of .NET (8.0). Godot 4.2 will still default to 6.0, but you can edit your .csproj file to change this.
 
Believe it or not, you can use full native AOT compilation with C# in Godot projects. That&#x27;s right: no more virtual machine IL interpreting JIT nonsense. Real machine code. Interpreted languages require too much imagination.
 
 Set it up like below, and you can completely ditch the CLR runtime and its dependencies for your game and get considerable performance gains. No more shitty virtual machine shit, unless you want stuff like runtime code generation &amp;…</span>

 Someone purchased my game recently and ran it on a very low spec Linux laptop. They knew full well that they didn&#x27;t meet the system requirements, but wanted to try it anyway. Turned out the game ran pretty awfully on Proton because of their hardware, the framerate skipped wildly around, their progress kept getting wiped out, and certain textures either didn&#x27;t load or popped in after several minutes.
 I had put off building for Linux until I could boot it up myself on an old PC, so I spent the day trying to debug the issue with them and figure out if there were certain settings that could improve their experience.
 In the end, we couldn&#x27;t find any fixes. So I took a leap of faith, put all my chips on Godot and just blindly built a Linux version for them without testing it, figuring it probably wouldn&#x27;t work but was worth a shot.
 It worked PERFECTLY, first try, no issues.
 Love this engine, love you guys. Shown above is me and the new player absolutely dumbfounded by Godot effortlessly taking care of business.

                              <span>just graduated with a BS in Software Engineering and like. what do you even do? the market is terrible and saturated. my degree took 2 extra years to finish due to my disability, and the worth of this degree seemed to only get worse and worse. in 2018 when I started it made sense to get this degree, now I feel like I would have been better off doing literally anything else. im now unemployed due to no longer being a student and therefore no more student job, and everywhere that I&#x27;ve applied to has either ghosted me or needed post-graduate experience. the entry level position feels dead. 
 i just had an interview with a startup and I was told im not what they&#x27;re looking for. at what point do you become what they&#x27;re fucking looking for? what was the point of my degree? 
 what do I do? do I just keep applying to this stupid rat race and hope something sticks?

                              <span>Recently got to last round interviews at a startup. Currently make 70k/yr at my current position and they offered 73k on 3 month contract-to-hire
 I have 3YOE. They said they loved me, and I told them this was too low and I preferred 44-50/hr. Their job description was 30-50
 He didn’t seem happy and said he’d get back to me by Monday.
 I feel like I blew it considering I’ve been looking for an opportunity for almost a year now.

                              <span>Seriously, it is so unjust and slimy to operate a boot camp right now. It&#x27;s like the ITT Tech fiasco from a decade ago. These vermin know that 99% of their alumni will not get jobs.
 It was one thing doing a bootcamp in 2021 or even 2022, but operating a bootcamp in 2023 and 2024 is straight up fucking fraud. These are real people right now taking out massive loans to attend these camps. Real people using their time and being falsely advertised to. Yeah, they should have done their diligence but it still shouldn&#x27;t exist.
 It&#x27;s like trying to start a civil engineering bootcamp with the hopes that they can get you to build a bridge in 3 months. The dynamics of this field have changed to where a CS degree + internships is basically the defacto &#x27;license&#x27; minimum for getting even the most entry level jobs now.

                              <span>I am currently working as a strat for a large bank, we predominantly code in c++ and python. I have somehow ended up managing a team of 10 persons, mostly vps and some associates. I am director myself and now barely code, although need to debug regularly to help the team when they are blocked.
 Thing is I was a bit naive and thought I had to climb the corporate ladder to increase comp, but I have now realised I would be much happier as an IC. I can now see that some vps are better paid than I thought so I would not mind going down a level and revised down comp.
 I find the management side of things quite draining actually, and I don&#x27;t feel the numbers add up to justify it.
 Wondering if anyone ever went though the same process? Internally or applied externally for an lower rung role?

Nobody uses the tool, the business doesn&#x27;t care about it since it doesn&#x27;t generate money and it isn&#x27;t critical to the business, and it seems like most of the members on the team have checked out and will only do something if the manager starts pressuring them.
 Obviously I can leave but the market sucks right now. What else can be done here? Is there a way to get the company to care about it?

                              <span>Apart from using an actual debugger - in some cases you can’t have a debugger attached to the process, or the behavior you’re facing is complex and emergent, and you cannot just put a breakpoint or log statement there. If attaching a debugger is possible, then of course I just attach a debugger.
 Let me share mines:
  
Isolate - if something’s tricky, try to have the simplest isolated reproduction that you can have. This cuts out unnecessary complexity and usually also speeds up iterations.
 Isolate early - it’s tempting to think that “I just need to fix this here, redeploy and it’ll probably work”, but I found that more often than not, I should have isolated the case earlier. It’s balancing between the likelihood of fixing it in place in a couple of iterations with a longer cycle and between investing time upfront in the isolation to have shorter feedback cycle. Also, the skill of efficiently isolating cases is something that improves with practice.
 “Approach from two ends” - I’m not sure if this has a name, sometimes it can be called ‘binary search’. When I tried everything that I could think of but it all doesn’t seem to make any sense, then I step back and try to ‘brute force’ it. This usually starts by taking my problematic case on one end, and a known working example of what I’m trying to achieve on the other end. Then I start modifying on both ends: stripping down parts on the first end, and adding more and more parts on the other end, so that they become more and more similar. At some point, the difference that I didn’t think of pops out. A similar approach also works for example if a new release of an app has a regression, but it’s not clear from the code change why - then we can start producing synthetic approximation releases in a test environment to see where exactly things break. I really like this approach, it really helped me solve cases where I had no idea why things don’t work.

                              <span>I am trying to locate a windows login bypass utility that I cannot remember the name of. If memory serves, the bootable tool would do something to the kernel to basically allowing any value to be typed into the password field. The utility did not reset or modify any system or passwords, just allowed bypass.
 I have the need of gaining admin access to a device, but due to the nature of the device, I need to do so in a way that does not modify any system files in any manner.
 Any help appreciated!

                              <span>Whats up all? 
 Something thats been on my mind, i know there have been some instances of smart video camera doorbells getting hacked.
 Smart lights are connect to wi-fi and can be controlled by a smartphone app.
 Is there any risk of other devices like a laptop being reached thats connected to the same wifi network?

                              <span>Hello, I am looking for an osint tool I used to work with a couple of years ago. It was a map, and whenever something big would happen(terrorist attack, natural disaster, etc) it would create a bubble and it would give you up to the minute information on it. I cannot for the life of me remember what it was called. I want to have it pulled up at my work 24/7. thanks in advance.

                              <span>I recently lost my job. I didn&#x27;t particularly like it, so it&#x27;s not sad in that sense; however, the financial implications are obviously less than ideal.
 I&#x27;ve been interested in cybersecurity for a long time and even took the CompTIA Security+ certification a few years ago just for fun, but that is the extent of my relevant experience. I want to use this as an opportunity to upskill myself and finally break into a field that I am genuinely passionate about, and I do not mind starting from the bottom. I have enough saved that I can go at this full time, 8-10 hours a day, for the next 4 months. Importantly, I have basically no other commitments.
 I have outlined a plan:
  
 Month 1: TryHackMe + HTB boxes with walkthrough to get the basics down and document all progress. 
 Month 2: Study for and take the PNPT (can&#x27;t afford the OSCP), continue with HTB and THM. 
 Month 3: Renew Security+ cert and start applying for tons of jobs, keep going at it with HTB and THM. 
 Month 4: Keep applying, and hopefully get some interviews, and keep doing the same stuff and document all progress. And if I get no results maybe try my luck in Bug Bounty hunting.
  
I know this is a massive undertaking, and I realize it&#x27;s going to be a tough few months. But I&#x27;ve always seemed to learn quickly, and I&#x27;m very committed to making this happen.
 I would greatly appreciate any feedback, critique, and advice that could help me in my journey.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve written pktstat-bpf, a simple replacement for ncurses/libpcap-based pktstat, using Linux eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) program, allowing packet statistics gathering even under very high traffic volume conditions, typically several million packets per second even on an average server. In this scenario (high volume, DoS attacks etc.) typically regular packet capture solutions start being unreliable due to increasing packet loss.
 By default it uses TC (Traffic Control) eBPF hooks with TCX attaching requiring at minimum Linux kernel v6.6 for both ingress and egress traffic statistics. Alternatively it can switch to XDP (eXpress Data Path) hook but with a consequence of losing egress statistics since XDP works only in ingress path. XDP mode due to XDP program to network interface attaching calls requires at minimum Linux kernel v5.9. Some distributions might have backported XDP/TC patches (notable example is Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel) and eBPF program might work on older kernels too.
 When using XDP on SmartNICs (100GE and more) it is possible to run in XDP Offloaded mode where XDP program loads directly on NIC with hardware XDP support and executes without using CPU, allowing wire speed statistics even on 100+Gbps speeds.
 At the end of the execution program will display per-IP and per-protocol statistics sorted by per-connection bps, packets and (source-IP:port, destination-IP:port) tuples, either in plaintext or as JSON.
 Program consists of the eBPF code in C and the pure-Go userland Golang program that parses and outputs final IP/port/protocol/bitrate statistics. Go part of the program uses wonderful cillium/ebpf library to load and run eBPF program, interfacing with eBPF map.
 I would be glad to hear about any improvements, bugs or otherwise. File an issue or ping me in the comments. Thanks!

 I&#x27;ve never been a big twitter user but I&#x27;m honestly baffled by this. What&#x27;s the point of a platform where your reach is limited if your posts get engagement? Has this happened to anyone else? Also is tagging support in a public post really the only way to contact their customer support? This is wild

                              <span>I have a background in the medical field that I left a few years ago to start making games- something I&#x27;ve always loved, ever since I was a young kid trying to rope my siblings into playing my D&amp;D campaigns with me.
 There&#x27;s been a lot of learning and a few failed projects and teams that fell apart- the last one about a year ago put a rift between my best friend (the project&#x27;s programmer), another friend (artist), and me (game designer).
 And now, I&#x27;ve been spending the last 6 months making a spooky strategy game that has some genuinely interesting things about it, and my efforts to promote it have left such a bad taste in my mouth.

                              <span>The image crate, Rust&#x27;s most popular image handling library, is out with a new release! It brings speedups and other enhancements for a variety of image formats.
 JPEG
 This release switches from jpeg-decoder to zune-jpeg crate for decoding JPEG images. This brings a massive performance improvement.
 zune-jpeg&#x27;s performance is on par with libjpeg-turbo, an extensively optimized library that has more assembly in it than C. Matching that performance in pure Rust is an outstanding achievement!
 Because of this change, the obscure &quot;lossless JPEG&quot; format used almost exclusively in medical imaging is no longer supported. If you need to handle lossless JPEG, we recommend using jpeg-decoder directly.
 This change also allows proper support for memory limits. jpeg-decoder could allocate potentially…</span>

                              <span>UPDATE: I can&#x27;t thank you all enough for your input. Your responses were helpful, comical (roasting mgr), and most importantly emphasizing the true scope and scale of the request as being largely unrealistic. I checked out the recommended tools, and some of you gave me avenues for quick shortcuts and workarounds, but overall I was convinced that this is not worth trying to any appreciable degree. My fear is getting too deep into a project only to fail to deliver, and I was armed with enough general consensus to make an informed statement to stakeholders that the project, as outlined, was not feasible without outside resources in this timeframe. With that, I showed them RenPy and said I could deliver on a visual novel, nothing more, and that it could be both informative and interactive, but…</span>

                              <span>I’ve been developing games and I feel very confident in being able to program most mechanics and systems. I also am very confident in my model and rigging skills. While developing games though they tend to feel very sandbox-y and tend to not feel quite as polished as a lot of professionally made games. I’ve added some polish techniques like invisible walls, more linear level design but they still feel “projecty” and not at the level of a product. Any tips and tricks anyone has to make their games feel more professional?

Made with Go-Raylib (OpenGL framework) https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go the game is (not very good) free on Steam.
 Before looking at the code be warned I taught myself to code and it is unconventional. However, it may be useful or inspirational for someone so here it is https://github.com/unklnik/bitty_knight
 Free to play on Steam https://store.steampowered.com/app/2751370/Bitty_Knight/

 I&#x27;m a beginner to programming and was learning Go for some time now.
 I have build only simple projects.
 Can you share some of the cool projects you have built ? Any project ideas to share ?
 Would also like to know what all projects you put up in your resume to get your first job ? Have you deployed the projects you have put up in your resume ?
 Any tips or anything for a beginner trying to get job in this tiring market?
 Also can you share some open source projects I can try to contribute ? Ik it&#x27;s hard but It sounds cool to contribute on cool projects.

Is there any item, physical book or manual, or really anything at all that involves golang that you use regularly an get a lot of use out of or enjoy?

 Hi! I recently (finally!) finished a planned blog post introducing the Lua runtime piccolo and I wanted to share it here. This is not a new project, and I&#x27;ve talked about it before, but it has recently resumed active work, and I&#x27;ve never had a chance to actually talk about it properly before in public in one place that I can point to.
 This is not meant as an advertisement to use piccolo or to even contribute to piccolo as much as it is a collection of thoughts about stackless interpreters, garbage collection, interpreter design, and (sort of) a love letter to coroutines. It is also a demo of piccolo and what makes it unique, and there are some examples for you to try out in live REPLs on the blog post.
 I hope you find it interesting!

 Godot Project Builder is a graphical automation tool for exporting and publishing Godot projects. It supports automated tasks for exports, uploading to popular stores (Steam, GOG, Epic, itch io) and basic file operations, all configured using a convenient GUI.
 It&#x27;s available as a project (requires at least Godot 4.3 dev6) or executable. You can get it here: https://github.com/KoBeWi/Godot-Project-Builds or in the AssetLib. Includes installable plugin for quick launch directly from your project.
 Project Builder supports exporting projects both from Godot 4 and Godot 3.

                              <span>There really is too much to know these days, what areas are there to specialize in?
 My thoughts:
 Kubernetes - I can see why some engineers love it. An awesome paradigm at the base layer and so much interesting built on top of it.
 Observability - almost a science in itself and plenty to get into (or related to) be it monitoring, alerting, analytics, service management. 
 Platform management - building out a consumable platform, kinda like being a developer for developers.
 Architect - the problem I have with this is developers are going to have their own software architects doing system design that the may overlap already with the infra side. Also many expect engineers to have software architects skills anyway. So where does that leave the cloud/DevOps architect? I feel there is not much mileage in this path.
 Any others? As each year passes the more I think it is not a good idea to stay in the middle as a generalist and time to pick a path.

                              <span>As suggested by someone from this community, I&#x27;ve moved the pipelines on Automate All The Things from Azure Devops to GitHub Actions.
 I didn’t know GitHub Actions was free when the repo is public. This makes it SOO much easier to get started with the project, so thank you stranger who suggested this!
 https://github.com/tferrari92/automate-all-the-things
 The Azure DevOps version is still there in its own branch.
 Any other feedback or suggestions are always welcomed! There&#x27;s always room for improvement.
 Also.. Nirvana Edition with Backstage.io is coming soon!

                              <span>How do you manage the changes in Infrastructure as code, with respect to testing before putting into production? Production infra might differ a lot from the lower environments. Sometimes the infra component we are making a change to, may not even exist on a non-prod environment.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Recently I joined company with very bad codebase. Plain react with javascript, no standards, no linting or type checking, first changes dating back to 2015. Codebase is editied by everything based on their needs, so you can image quality of the code.
 Converting to typescript is impossible due to scope and lack of human resources. Everyone in the team likes current setup and really not cares about improving. Mgnment wants me to improve everything (they don’t know what, they just want to be sure that project is up to these days standarts) and fix bugs that noone can fix. So naturally other devs are maximum junior-mid level.
 I feel like I am loosing my skills and this is my biggest worry. I am super afraid to become bad at coding after working in these kind of projects. I am literally abandoning typescript and good coding standarts. No one wants to do big improvements or changes, only me. Should I try to do something about it or better not waste my time and switch company? I have joined this company due to pay raise, but it feels like skills cut…

                              <span>I&#x27;m a fairly experienced dev with a broad knowledge so I tend to move around teams as needed. It&#x27;s kind of my thing and companies like it because I always work on top priorities.
 However this has exposed me to the fact that every single local build never ever works initially. Normally there are some docs slightly out of date, you follow them and error. Some unhappy container, undefined variables, some stuff that doesn&#x27;t install, unit tests won&#x27;t run.
 The only way to make it run is to fight through it during long several days of debugging, normally heavily assisted by someone in the team that has the right lore (normally this person is busy for the same reason so can only help here and there) 
 It kills me that in my 10 plus years I haven&#x27;t seen much progress in this part of the dev cycle. Docker was supposed to fix it but then we made stuff around docker complex. We have fancy complicated and fragil infra. Don&#x27;t get me started with stuff like bazel. When Mr bazel had enough and leaves the company, it becomes the &quot;we don&#x27;t know what that does so don&#x27;t touch it&quot; and it&#x27;s exactly where it will break when I&#x27;m trying to get up to speed. 
 Sorry a bit ranty. 
 Have I been unlucky in my career or have you seen this issue too? Have you found some strategies that solve or help with this?

                              <span>As far as I can tell most projects here are about consoles. I would like to know what could be a “relatively easy” old school computer to emulate with a difficulty similar to the DMG GameBoy.
 Please don’t suggest me the ZX spectrum or other Sinclair computers because those don’t have any kind of graphics chip or sound in many cases.
 I am more interested in suggestions around Commodore 64, Apple IIc, IBM XT or similar computers. 
 Thanks in advance.
 P.D. My real goal is to understand how much harder an old school computer emulator is compared to a GameBoy or NES emulator.
 I don’t know if I am being naive but the existence of family basic for the Nintendo Famicom leads me to believe that an old micro computer could be very similar to old consoles in term of emulation

 How do you ensure that your monitoring stack is working as expected and you didn&#x27;t messed up the config?
 If you&#x27;re using a Saas (Grafana cloud, datadog, whatever) do you have another solution that will alert you in case of an outage?
 Maybe it&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s no simple solution that&#x27;s worth the effort. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

                              <span>As someone who&#x27;s starting a CS internship soon, I&#x27;m curious as to what seasoned devs get annoyed by when working with interns. I think it would be interesting if the devs who&#x27;ve worked with interns vented about things they typically do that are bad, and us incoming interns can learn what not to do.

                              <span>In other careers (think law, finance, teaching) the more experienced you get the more your value and command over your work increases.
 But in software, things change so fast that you never really get to &#x27;expert&#x27; level, and always need to keep learning new things. 
 So how long do people usually keep this going? And does upskilling get challenging with age?
 I&#x27;ve rarely ever worked with engineers who were in their 50s or above, and the few I have worked with seemed like they did struggle.
 Is this a career for the young and not something you should plan to do for the rest of your life?

                              <span>Been in IT security for over 20 years, have been shopping around for my next job (am FT employed). Yes, you are right, the market sucks donkey ass.
 Jobs opening on my level (lead security architect, etc) - dozens of apps within hours as far as I can tell. Before I started my current job 5 years ago, I’d get recruiters trying to poach me every single day over LI.
 Also considering the fact that I’ll be pushing 50 soon makes the future looking very very bleak for me.
 Not even mentioning the pay — market has capped it on a level 5 years ago at least.

 He said Sorry we&#x27;re looking for backend developer and hung up on me.
 I knew the technical discrepancy between engineers and recruiters were there however I didn&#x27;t suppose the discrepancy could be this large.
 Edit: he might just wanted to hire pure backend developers but again there was no need throw full-stack developers out of the window, some full-stack developers are more backend focused (like me) than others.
 End rant.

 I posted about Luminal a few months ago, and since then we&#x27;ve made significant progress in the CUDA and Metal compilers.
 For those who don&#x27;t know, Luminal is a a deep learning library that uses composable compilers to achieve high performance. It&#x27;s entirely written in Rust and orders of magnitude simpler than comparable ML frameworks.
 Recently we&#x27;ve been working on speeding up performance on Nvidia and Apple GPUs, which led us to write compilers capable of generating kernels on the fly. These kernels are compiled once and ran many times, and since the whole compute graph is known at compile time, we can get very aggressive with the kernel optimizations.
 We&#x27;re adding tons more features (autograd landed a few weeks ago, so training is now possible!) so check out the blog post and the repo if you&#x27;d like to know more!

                              <span>I really love working on Rust up until I have to add async to the mix. Lately I just avoid adding async at all costs because it just comes with so many caveats and gotchas that the effort is sometimes not worth the performance improvement. Some of the things that I absolutely find annoying:
  
async is not part of rust, it&#x27;s a library. The main one being Tokio with no real alternative. I applaud the work done on this but it all just feels horribly hacky. 
 
any time you have to use async you taint all your functions and types with it. As if dropping a bucket of paint (worse than paint but let&#x27;s keep it civil) all over your code. It makes refactoring a horrible experience. As you crawl your codebase to make it async you eventually end up with an impossible task and have to find ugly alternatives (looking at you async fn in traits)
 
while the rust compiler has been an amazing tool along the journey, it just fails miserably with async. It won&#x27;t complain at all if you forgot to remove a blocking fs call in an async context and of course it will fail horribly at run time. And when the program eventually crashes, it will just render the most obscure stacktrace i&#x27;ve ever seen. FAR from the developper experience of vanilla Rust.
 
 Overall for such a great language with so many features, it just feels broken as soon as you put your finger in the async business. I ve been looking at the async improvement proposals but apart from async fn traits, i just don&#x27;t see anything revolutionary that would make the experience better. 
 At some point, shouldn&#x27;t it just be part of the language if async Rust is to improve in a major way ? 
 Disclaimer: I am not a Rust expert, but i ve been programming for 25+ years in many different languages.

                              <span>This isnt technically rust related, but Gleam is a language written in rust and it&#x27;s very much inspired by rust. 
 As far as I know, it appears to be using rusts type system but with a GC. It might be a good fit for small projects where rust could be overkill. Or maybe as a scripting language.

                              <span>Why is this a problem? There are times when I am play testing a prototype and I can’t tell if what I am playing is fun or what I need to do to make it better. I thought this was perhaps just something that is exclusive to the games I am making. So I boot up some games in my backlog, games I haven’t played yet. No luck there. So I boot up some games I played in the past, games that I loved, no luck either. I am a solo game developer, so there’s no escaping the play testing phase. Does anyone else have this problem? Did you ever manage to figure out how to solve this? If you didn’t I would love to hear what you pivot your career to.

                              <span>I created a mod and run a server for a game and just received a DMCA takedown from my server&#x27;s hosting company on behalf of a company which runs a similar, standalone game. The DMCA takedown request has images of the &quot;infringing works&quot; but all of the claimed assets are from different mod from the same game that my mod is for, none of those assets are in my mod or hosted on my server.
 My hosting company has given me two options: 1) remove the infringing content or 2) reply with a valid DMCA counter-notice and wait 10 days. My problem is that I have no infringing content to remove and I don&#x27;t want to wait 10 days to bring my server back online.
 Has anyone dealt with false DMCA takedown requests? I would like to be transparent and publicly post the full DMCA request and evidence for my community so they can know what is going on and see that we have infringed on nothing. Is this worth getting a lawyer for? This is a hobby project that doesn&#x27;t take donations so paying thousands of dollars for a lawyer isn&#x27;t an option.
 Thanks.

 I&#x27;m 7 years into this. I want to exit at 10 years to do something else after paying off my home - paying off the home so that I can afford to go down in income. 
 Right now I&#x27;m balancing my full time job with my side gig that I&#x27;d like to eventually transition to a full time gig. 
 Anyone else doing this? So many people want to transition into tech that I feel like I hear fewer stories of seasoned tech employees transitioning out of tech, though I know it must be a thing and I am not the only one.
 (And if there&#x27;s a subreddit/community where people like this gather and chat, please drop me a link.)

 I&#x27;m gonna have a system design round with a company that boasts that they expect their EMs+ to be technically as good as a Staff+ Engineers (only from system design ability POV). I know this might seem weird but please kindly ignore this. I&#x27;m not worried.
 Now that brings me to the title. 
 If you&#x27;re someone who does system design interviews for Staff+ positions, what are the reasons you reject them? 
 Assume the scenario where the candidate thinks it went well. Yet you looked for some important things and you reject them. Why?

                              <span>I just went to start our biweekly meeting on a major branch of our product, and a coworker juts in and kicks it off themselves instead, saying everything has been reprioritized. They apparently had a random in-person meeting with the superior behind my back where they talked status and prioritization. There was no outreach or status inquiry on my end as the lead.
 I don&#x27;t really know how else to take it. Seems not random to me, and it feels like I&#x27;m getting edged out for some reason.
 Have you guys had something like this happen before? Should I position one way or another in response to this?
 I&#x27;ve always ran the meeting in the past, and we&#x27;re ahead of schedule. It just seems weird that they&#x27;ve taken the reigns and spoken in my place when I was the lead on it. Maybe I&#x27;m reading into it but it seems pretty blatant.

                              <span>Hello fellow programs! 
 tl;dr some revisions to the rules to reduce low quality blogspam. The most notable are: banning listicles (&quot;7 cool things I copy-pasted from somebody else!&quot;), extreme beginner articles (&quot;how to use a for loop&quot;), and some limitations on career posts (they must be related to programming careers). Lastly, I want feedback on these changes and the subreddit in general and invite you to vote and use the report button when you see posts that violate the rules because they&#x27;ll help us get to it faster.
 r/programming&#x27;s mission is to be the place with the highest quality programming content, where I can go to read something interesting and learn something new every day. Last time we spoke I introduced the rules that we&#x27;ve been moderating by to accomplish that. Subjectively, …</span>

                              <span>I would like to have and idea of how much harder an emulator for the original GameBoy is compared with the Space Invaders arcade. Is the GameBoy too hard as project after chip8? Or is Sapce Invaders the way to go? What are the main issues I might encounter? 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I am writing a C64 emulator as my first real emulator project after CHIP 8. As of now I have implemented the CPU, bank switching and rendering the screen memory. 
 I loaded up the character, basic and kernal roms and it expectedly didn&#x27;t work right away. I fixed a couple of bugs but it still doesn&#x27;t work and I feel stuck.
 The code seems to execute normally but at some point it enters this section of code and it is stuck in this loop infinitely: 
 ramtz1 inc tmp0+1 ;move index thru memory ramtz2 lda (tmp0),y ;get present data tax ;save in .x lda #$55 ;do a $55,$aa test sta (tmp0),y cmp (tmp0),y bne size rol a sta (tmp0),y cmp (tmp0),y bne size txa ;restore old data sta (tmp0),y iny bne ramtz2 beq ramtz1 
 It seems to me that the bne size instructions are the only way out of the loop, but I dont get how they would ever trigger. It stores the accumulator value into memory and then just compares the accumulator against the the memory location the accumulator was just stored in. How are they ever not equal?
 I must be missing something.

                              <span>In a regular cgb game, can I rely on the fact that there should be a return for each call? or are there circumstances where the code manually pushes an address to the stack in order to use it as a return address? Because I&#x27;m currently counting the different calls and returns during execution and there sometimes seem to be more returns than calls (??)
 The occurrences I&#x27;m counting are:
 RET, conditional RET and RETI
 vs.
 CALL, conditional CALL, RST and whenever an Interrupt Handler gets called

                              <span>Hi, 
 I am very new to emu dev and this is my first C++ project, and I am having some trouble getting the basic IBM CHIP8 rom to work. I&#x27;ve linked the repository below to see if someone can tell what is wrong. If you simply compile the program then run &quot;./build/debug/emu roms/ibm.ch8&quot; it should run and show the output. Some of my code is from other projects on the internet and some I wrote myself, but I&#x27;m trying to identify what is not allowing it to work correctly. In my execute cycle, I am only running the opcode functions that are required for the IBM rom to make debugging easier. Thank you to anyone who can help.

                              <span>I am working on a cgb emulator. It has some minor issues but many games are playable. What do you guys think? The name is a bit weird, and didn&#x27;t really think about a better one. I also have some features in mind, that are currently not implemented. It was my first larger project ever, and the first emulator I made (besides a chip-8 to get a better idea about the internal workings of a cpu).

 I am open to any suggestions!

                              <span>This is my first emulation based on real hardware, and I&#x27;ve been leaning NES emulation from OLC&#x27;s video series. I made my implementation in Rust.
 I&#x27;m having multiple issues, specifically in the PPU. Ice Climber is the most obvious with the title screen demo. But Donkey Kong has a broken main menu with a bunch of blue 0&#x27;s. The demo has a bunch of magenta 0&#x27;s at the bottom, and the screen shifts a ton randomly.
 Baloon Fight is the best one, with no obvious glitches.
 This is what I currently have: https://gist.github.com/TaromaruYuki/5c3821a024b6e44a733bf3f67bb6673a
 I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s a scrolling issue, or even a nametable switching issue, but I can&#x27;t find anything.

                              <span>So I recently bought an electronics set which had a joystick module, and on the request of my senior in college, I&#x27;m thinking of making an emulator which runs on a raspberry pi module with the same joystick. But I&#x27;ve never made an emulator in my life, so do you have any resources which a beginner like me could refer and learn from to build this emulator.

                              <span>I want to get in to emulator development. I started to learn c++. What else should I learn before trying to make emulator? I&#x27;m planing on making a chip 8 after im done with c++ but I would like to know what else I should learn before diving in.
 Thank you

 Hi again! Last time i posted here was in 2019 I think with my chip-8 emulator. Now I have a created an Intel 8080 emulator!
 It started out as a space invaders emulator but I got more interested in creating a disassembler/debugger and implementing all the instructions instead :)
 For those interested in creating an intel 8080 emulator i have modified the (common?) test cpudiag.bin rom since it assumes the start address is 255 and not 0 which makes all the jumps/calls go to the wrong addresses.
 Links to source code and test rom:

 cpudiagFixed.bin

                              <span>I&#x27;m positively surprised by the performance. It struggled to keep framerate at 10fps. I&#x27;ve refactored bunch of places which had sub-optimal code, but what really done wonders is moving from usage of emscripten_set_main_loop to Emscripten&#x27;s Asyncify.
 Next steps:
  
Addressing some graphical bugs in other games (I&#x27;ve found some minor ones in Tetris in Excitebike)
 Implementing Controllers
 Implementing other common mappers other than NROM which is implemented at this moment.
 Implementing APU.
 UI tweaks (Right now, the thing that is buzzing me is the label of file input, that cannot be changed and it depends on browser language; Polish in my case, so I&#x27;m thinking about making custom one)
