I am trying to intercept the communication between me and the app. So i am using Kali as a virtual machine and i have bettercap inside. However i cannot see the request when i send it to the app. I can see everything else but the app.
 I hope someone can help.

                              <span>For starters: I think it&#x27;s a coinflip whether or not this post is against the rules. So mods, if you delete this post, I would appreciate anyone letting me know a more appropriate place to post this.
 For background: I initially learned Java 8 years ago and it got me hooked on computer science. I&#x27;ve gone down a traditional path for the most part as I now do back-end IT work focused on cloud migration, though have done a number of ad hoc projects that go beyond that and worked in a more data-analyst-esque position before I ended up in this job 8 months ago. I have professional experience in Python, R, SQL (Redshift, SQL Server, MySQL, and MS Access for whatever that might count for...), VBA, and some familiarity with bash and PowerShell to the extent that I could use the internet to help me automate some recurring processes.
 I discovered ethical hacking recently and I think it&#x27;s something I want to pursue. But, if I&#x27;m being honest, learning this feels pretty daunting and I&#x27;m not really sure where to begin (I&#x27;ve got a Linux VM booted up at the very least). 
 More or less, I&#x27;m looking for someone with experience that I can learn from and get support from. If anyone is interested and wants to chat, I&#x27;d be more than happy to compensate with my own hourly wage if it becomes long-term (my hope) .
 Really, I&#x27;m just looking for quality resources for a complete beginner because, while I can code, I&#x27;m definitely lacking in the knowledge required here.

                              <span>So printf() is not safe, so Bjarne decided to use cout and cin and overloaded &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; to fix that problem. But I was wondering why he just used regular functions. 
 ​
 I was looking at this comment
  
You couldn&#x27;t really in C++98, not at least with printf-style functions (there were some macro solutions to sort of make it work in a limited way, but it was painful to write and impossible to debug if something went wrong).

 Now you can have type safe functions. So what changed since then?

                              <span>So I have this class template (which you might recognize since I already had another question related to it 2 days ago, I must admit the whole template-taking-pointer-to-member-function fell pretty far into a level of template mastery I apparently don&#x27;t have yet)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; template  class LogWrapper { T* obj;
 public: LogWrapper(T* obj_): obj(obj_){} std::ostream&amp; operator()(std::ostream&amp; os) const { return (obj-&gt;*F)(os); } 
 }; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It works completely fine, until I want to use it with a const member function (same problem if I change the template parameter to pointer-to-non-const-member-function and use it with a const member function). 
 GCC gives me :  src/Platform.cpp:46:62: error: could not convert &#x27;((const Platform*)this)-&gt;DepthfulEntity::displayInfo&#x27; from &#x27;&#x27; to &#x27;std::basic_ostream&amp; (DepthfulEntity::*)(std::basic_ostream&amp;)&#x27; 46 | Debug::out (this) &lt;&lt; &#x27;\n&#x27;; 
 I could &quot;solve&quot; this by making two different classes, but their code would be exactly the same, and I&#x27;d like to avoid this kind of duplication. 
 Does anyone know how I could make such a template accept both pointers to const member functions and pointers to non-const member function ?

                              <span>I have a class that implements the operators for equality
 bool operator &#x3D;&#x3D; (const CNumber&amp; rhs);
 bool operator !&#x3D; (const CNumber&amp; rhs);
 Microsoft has a unit test framework with a function that tests equality
 template static void AreEqual(const T&amp; expected, const T&amp; actual, const wchar_t* message &#x3D; NULL, const __LineInfo* pLineInfo &#x3D; NULL) { FailOnCondition(expected &#x3D;&#x3D; actual, EQUALS_MESSAGE(expected, actual, message), pLineInfo); } 
 I try using it like this
 CNumber N3, N4; // Assume these get initialized with values Assert::AreEqual(N3, N4); 
 This causes a compilation error of
 error C2678: binary &#x27;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x27;: no operator found which takes a left-hand operand of type &#x27;const T&#x27; (or there is no acceptable conversion)
 In the function signature, both template arguments are const T&amp;. I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t compile. I&#x27;m sure it is me and I am missing a &#x27;const&#x27; or &#x27;&amp;&#x27; somewhere or need multiple versions of the operators. Help would be appreciated.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m making an interface with Windows.h with letters W and S, that returns a value when you press K. The problem that I&#x27;ve got is that I need to keep reading input but I can&#x27;t clear the buffer with all the W and S already pressed. Is there any way to solve this? Am I using cin.clear() or cin.ignore() wrong? The 100 was just a placeholder, I just need to delete until k is pressed.
 Code:
 include include using namespace std; int Interface(int min, int max, int distan); int main(){ int a; cout &gt; a; return 0; } int Interface(int min, int max, int distan){ bool n&#x3D;1; int height&#x3D;min-1; while(n&#x3D;&#x3D;1){ HANDLE handle; COORD coordinates; handle &#x3D; GetStdHandle(STD\_OUTPUT\_HANDLE); coordinates.X &#x3D; distan; coordinates.Y &#x3D; height; SetConsoleCursorPosition(handle,coordinates); while(1){ if((GetKeyState(0x57) &amp; 0x80) !&#x3D; 0){ if(height&gt;min-1){ height--; Sleep(180); } break; } if((GetKeyState(0x53) &amp; 0x80) !&#x3D; 0){ if(height&lt;max-1){ height++; Sleep(180);} break; } if((GetKeyState(0x4B) &amp; 0x80) !&#x3D; 0){ n&#x3D;0; Sleep(180); system(&quot;cls&quot;); return height-min+2; break; } }} cin.clear(); cin.ignore(100,&#x27;k&#x27;); }

                              <span>I have derived classes that are singletons. But when I try to cout one of its members the program ends without errors. I&#x27;ve checked the memory and it seems to be uninitialized. I tried making the member static but ended up with some errors I couldn&#x27;t understand. This is my repository:

 Can someone tell me what is happening?

                              <span>Hi all, Are there tools out there that can scan through projects and identify platform-specific code? I want to see if I can port some small/mid-sized projects built for windows to Linux/macOS. If there is no such tool, I might try to make one myself (although I&#x27;m not sure how much of a challenge that would be at this point)

                              <span>I was wondering if anyone could help me - whilst I do eventually get a new project all set up how I want it, it&#x27;s always a hassle and always seems to take me hours. Is there a workflow anyone has to create a C++ project for visual studio code or visual studio and I would like to also be able to add raylib, imgui and rlimgui and also know how to add other projects - this is getting to the point where I am considering to another language and I really don&#x27;t want to do that. Right now, I have the premake visual studio project for raylib which works fine, but I also want rlimgui functionality in it too, and I added the rlimgui and imgui directories to my project directory and added them to the compiler include directories, which means they are recognised as I can use  to enclose them without the red underlines in visual studio. however, I get linker errors and whilst I know where to link libraries, I cannot see where the libraries are for imgui/rlimgui (if they even exist).

                              <span>Hi all!
 I wondering why I should ever return a function by reference. If the object to be return is large I can just rely on the RVO of the compiler and return it by value.
 What am I missing here?

I want to develop games just as a fun hobby and projects I can showcase but I don&#x27;t know where to start or what resources to use to learn. And what game libraries are there for C++.
 I tried to follow online guides but most of them use Visual Studio, I never used it as I am on linux (manjaro) and dont know anything about VS.

 I&#x27;m looking for good documentation or tutorials or githubs to learn building my own webserver in C++
 I want to learn how to parse headers, implement GET - HEAD - POST - DELETE etc..
 And also serve text files, html, json etc..
 And i have no idea where to start so i&#x27;m asking on reddit, thanks !

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say we have the following struct:
 struct Position { int X; int Y; int Z &#x3D; 5; }; 
 Have I understood correctly that
  
1) By writing Position pos; X and Y will be initialized with random values while Z will be 5?
 2) By writing Position pos{}; X and Y will be zero-initialized (aka equal to NULL aka 0) while Z will be 5?
 3) By writing Position pos{ .Y &#x3D; 3 }; X will be initialized to 0, Y will be instantly initialized to 3, while Z will be 5?
  
Now let&#x27;s say we have the following code snippet:
 Position pos1{}; pos1.X &#x3D; 1; pos1.Y &#x3D; 3; pos1.Z &#x3D; 7; Position pos2 { .X &#x3D; 1, .Y &#x3D; 3, .Z &#x3D; 7 }; 
  
4) Will the compiler understand that there is no need to first give all members of pos1 default values before immediately assigning new values? I.e., will the compiler immediately initialize pos1.Y to 3?
 5) Finally, is there a standard in how professional C++ coders want code to be written when comparing pos1 and pos2? What is your personal preference when comparing how pos1 and pos2 are created?

                              <span>There is no subreddit for make, and it&#x27;s highly related to CPP, so...
 I tried to write a Makefile for my cpp project and encountered a bug.
 foo: @echo foo &gt; foo %: force @echo force force: ; 
 when I run make bar, I got the following output:
 $ make bar force force 
 It printed force twice. Do you know why?
 Edit: I found Reddit somehow messed up with my code, I re-edited it.

                              <span>I&#x27;m thinking it would be nice to have a library that provided a integer type template that the user would specialize with upper / lower bounds and the correct width / signedness would be selected automatically, as well as implicit bounds check assertions on change. Does such a thing exist already?

                              <span>So we upgraded at work from gcc 8 version to gcc 11. Now we have check in makefile to remove unused include files. All it does is remove the include lines one by one and if the source file still compiles after removing a line the we give error that include not needed. And we remove the include line.
 Okay so all is fine here but another person tries to compile on gcc 13 which changed some of the include locations so they got errors compiling which I suppose is expected. To fix we had to add back some include lines.
 But just wondering if this is some problem with language in that it is not totally backwards compatible in that you may have to change source to get it to compile with later version of gcc.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use CURL in a program and this requires me to add the following include statement in my program:
 #include  
 However my compiler is telling me there is no such file or directory. 
 I have updated my include path with the location path for curl\curl.h
 I downloaded the curl repository straight from github and thought it would be instantly ready to be used in my programs.
 I am using Visual Studio Code.
 Is there additional steps I need to do before using the curl library in my project? Is downloading the .h files for curl not enough?

                              <span>I am currently reading the book &quot;Move Semantics&quot; by Josuttis. I cannot follow one of his arguments about rvalue references. So we have the following function declaration:
 void foo(X&amp;&amp;); 
 Now we have another function that is defined as follows:
 void callfoo(X&amp;&amp; arg) { foo(std::move(arg)); } 
 He argues that since arg is a name it is treated as an lvalue and so even if arg binds to an rvalue reference, we have to use std::move() whenever we try to pass it to a function that requires rvalue reference. So that means that arg suddenly changes its type from rvalue reference to an lvalue?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently enrolled in a technical course on System Development, and last year we covered the basics of C++ and C. For the rest of the course, we&#x27;ll be diving into other programming languages such as Java, Kotlin, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and some SQL.
 I have a strong interest in continuing to learn C++, particularly for creating games and simulations. However, I&#x27;m unsure if I should prioritize C++ right now or focus on more in-demand programming languages to increase my chances of landing my first job. I have about 1.6 years left until the course ends.
 Is it difficult to find a junior position or internship in C++?

                              <span>Hi,
 a few years ago I had GTA V running on my Debian installation but then I got a new PC and on that I failed to make it run.
 I am now making another attempt and again I am not getting very far...
 I have installed lutris and with lutris I have installed the Epic Games Store. Now I need to log into the Epic Game Store but I cannot do it: When I enter my email I get a captcha and after that ann error &quot;please turn on javascript and reload&quot; - I never even get to the point where I could enter my password, so before I waste a lot of time now my questions:
 1) can you nowadays run GTAV on Debian testing
 and
 2) if you can how do you install it?

                              <span>I know quite a bit about C, and I&#x27;m an average user of Linux, however sometimes I get stuck on things that look esoteric to me despite having some knowledge in the matter.
 For instance, I found this C code here:
 #include  #include  #include  #include  #include  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { struct addrinfo *result &#x3D; NULL; int rc; struct addrinfo hint; if (argc &lt; 2) { printf (&quot;Usage: %s hostname\n&quot;, argv[0]); exit(1); } printf (&quot;Resolving \&quot;%s\&quot;... &quot;, argv[1]); memset(&amp;hint, 0 , sizeof (hint)); hint.ai_socktype &#x3D; SOCK_STREAM; rc &#x3D; getaddrinfo (argv[1], NULL, &amp;hint, &amp;result); printf (&quot;result: %d\n&quot;, rc); } 
 The code looks quite simple, the problem comes to its compilation that seems to require a special kind of compiler, like so:
 ./toolchain-mips_34kc_gcc-4.8-linaro_musl-1.1.2/bin/mips-openwrt-linux-gcc getaddr.c -DNEED_PRINTF -o getaddr_tplink 
 Here is where I don&#x27;t know what to do, do I install this with the typical sudo apt install? Or do I download it from some server? Can I use the common gcc command installed in Linux? And if so, with which flags? I simple don&#x27;t know what to do!

                              <span>Hi folks, I have a problem.
 I have to program a quiz in C and I have the problem that the printfs are not displayed after an input.
 I don&#x27;t understand why.
 So, sometimes everything works and then after trying again it doesn&#x27;t work again.
 If you understand German, don&#x27;t be surprised, the questions and answers are meant to be fun and not really do anything negative. 😅

                              <span>Title. I know that the Standard allows for NULL to not be represented as all-bits-zero, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find many examples of it that aren&#x27;t historical. Zeroing the bytes of a pointer and getting NULL out of it is really convenient and I won&#x27;t give it up unless there are modern real-world C implementations (conformance testing ones like TenDRA don&#x27;t count) where it doesn&#x27;t work. Thanks!

 so iam wondering which IDE i should use. thanks.

                              <span>Very memory conscious applications may consider cramming data into (usually the highest bits of) pointers. Most 64 bit systems support 48 bit virtual addresses, leaving room for a 2 bytes of data. This obviously comes at the cost of portability.
 However, if the program is aware at compile time of its maximum memory requirement (and assumes some fragmentation overhead), it should be able to restrict its virtual address space via setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS, &amp;rlim) , ensuring a program defined number of bits in pointers are usable.
 For example, say I know my program will never use more than 6 GiB. Then its VA space could be confined to 8 GiB (33 bit addresses). This ensures I get 31 bits for data in my pointers:
 unsigned long long MAX_ADDR &#x3D; (1ull&lt;&lt;34) - 1; const struct rlimit { rlim_t rlim_cur; rlim_t rlim_max; } r &#x3D; { MAX_ADDR, MAX_ADDR}; setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS, &amp;r); 
 One specific application (that prompted the idea) are bitmap tries, where the alphabet size imposes whether the bitmap of a node can be stored within the pointer or has to be a separate field (also taking up memory due to alignment).
 Thoughts? Is this a decent idea for making tagged pointers portable or squeezing more memory?

                              <span>Ok so I am totally new at this please help me
 Since my college will be starting at mid of July thought of learning C Lang atleast basics.....and I didn&#x27;t even started yet and have some doubts ....so the thing is I had just started to learn from yt From a channel called neso academy.....the code that she showed went like. 
 include 
 Int main()
 { 
 pintf(&quot;hello world&quot;)
 return 0;
 }
 [The code was prewritten on the app he used called code blocks i installed same but mine one went like
 include 
 include 
 Int main() { pintf(&quot;hello world!\n&quot;) return 0; }
 So why is there extra !\n and include 
 Please someone explain 🥲

                              <span>The way I&#x27;ve seen finite-state machines work is instantly being able to determine their next state based on input. I heard once that switch statements compiled to code capable of this, but is it really? I&#x27;m also fairly new to function pointers but think they might be more suitable. I only really got into use of function pointers when I moved away from C++.
 Update: As luck would have it I also just thought of a kind of table, actually more like a tree, which simply fetches the successive indices at each state/input intersection within an array; index 0 and every nth one after it being a &quot;state&quot; and all other entries being &quot;inputs&quot;, which simply store the virtual addresses of the next state to enter. Bear in mind I&#x27;m test running this as means to parse and assemble assembly language.

                              <span>Hello, new to C here. Ive set up VScode to compile with UCRT. Just downloaded SDL2 minGW x86 and put in a dev folder. 
 I have my template folder open. Include and lib went into the source file. The tutorial im watching says to use makefile which ive never used until now. Seems like when i try to build my code it acts like i didn’t define the path for SDL2. 
 If anyone could let me know what makes this process easier i would greatly appreciate the time. 
 Main.c runs #include stdio.h and #include SDL.h

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;ve been coding a terminal text editor in C purely for the learning experience of low level programming. However, I&#x27;ve run into a problem that I can&#x27;t really wrap my head around. If I try moving the cursor to the end of a line with tabs, the cursor will stop too early. Therefore, I thought maybe I should replace the tab characters for each line of the file, but then I remembered Vim. Vim can change the &#x27;shiftwidth&#x27; of the tab character (i.e 8 spaces get turned into 2 spaces according to the shiftwidth variable) without directly affecting the line itself! So I&#x27;m wondering how I can implement this in my own program and allow the cursor to adjust to the tab size?
 For reference, here&#x27;s the source code for my program if anyone&#x27;s interested: https://github.com/MoolsDogTwo/Centi
 Buffer &amp; cursor functions are in their respective c &amp; h files. This program is by no means functional yet, but it&#x27;s better something than nothing.

                              <span>In Go, string is basically just an alias for []byte with the biggest difference that using range to iterate over a string yields rune which represents a Unicode code point (whereas iterating over []byte naturally yields the bytes).
 So that means that a string does not actually conceptually represent (valid) text at all. You can very easily store &quot;invalid text&quot; (as defined by an invalid UTF-8 sequence) in a string. For example: https://go.dev/play/p/rkzxctJBxsK
 package main import ( &quot;fmt&quot; &quot;unicode/utf8&quot; ) func main() { s :&#x3D; &quot;Pok\xE9mon&quot; fmt.Printf(&quot;Is %s valid? %t\n&quot;, s, utf8.ValidString(s)) fmt.Println(&quot;Runes:&quot;) for index, rune :&#x3D; range s { fmt.Printf(&quot;Rune %d: %c (%d)\n&quot;, index, rune, rune) } fmt.Println(&quot;\nBytes:&quot;) for index, byte :&#x3D; range []byte(s) { fmt.Printf(&quot;Byte%d: %c (%d)\n&quot;, in…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve tried learning lots of languages from python which i quit because i felt i was lost in libraries and frameworks and it stopped appealing to me when that happened same situation happened with javascript between the frameworks and updates (frontend web dev is a headache) i really wanted to learn rust because it caters to my goals but it was too hard for me to grasp and i found go which kinda caters to my goals but is easier than rust. should i learn and commit to go eventhough i haven&#x27;t fully grasped easier languages? and if so is there a certain roadmap to follow or specific way to go about learning go that are different from js and python? and where to make friends or find mentors in go?
 edit: I’m not saying that new technology scares me (I get it it kinda sounds like that) I really gave JavaScript and python my all and built lots of projects for a span of a 5 months but I felt like I wasn’t getting closer to my goals and felt more like a chore I just wasn&#x27;t enjoying it since I’m truly not interested in web dev nor data science I’ve always been interested in operating systems and backend more than anything

                              <span>I will be blant. I hate web development. It almost feels like a bunch of docs and scripts running on a server. It is super tedious (Backend stuff is a bit more tolerable, but still not my cup of tea).
 In general I am a desktop app and mathematical programming kind of guy. I like ML stuff. I like image processing, signals, etc.
 I also know assembly, even tho I generaly don&#x27;t do low level stuff. I am currently trying to learn audio programming and 3D. The resources on these things are *very* limited, and kinda difficult to find something that breaks down things in ways I can understand. (I do not necessarily ask for resources btw. It is just my observation)
 I said all of this to explain my overall &quot;style&quot; of programming
 Every tutorial, discussion, even memes related to programming, is very webdev oriented. Hell, whenever I say that I am a programmer to other programmers, sometimes I get asked about the web apps I&#x27;ve built. It is ridiculous!
 My overall question is: Should I move forward with my niches, or give web development a bit more attention?

But I&#x27;m learning to code and I&#x27;m trying to pick a specialization and and In trying to gather some feedback but be it any field, everybody&#x27;s just crying everywhere on how the market&#x27;s bad and there&#x27;s so much saturation whether you&#x27;re learning Web Dev or breathing Oxygen.
 I know that saturation exists in everything and in every-field almost but internally it&#x27;s stopping me from learning anything. It&#x27;s disturbing me mentally.
 I just want to code interfaces. That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s what I love and that&#x27;s something probably I can do for life. And with Interfaces I mean every interface, Web, Mobile, TV, Watch etc. etc. 
 I know it will take time and and will happen gradually and I don&#x27;t mind that. But people saying things like Frontend Developer is obsolete, or Android Development has no jobs has idk why but made me worried mentally.
 I have only want one of two, either a remote job (My country has a lesser pay, plus I hate the work culture here) or a career in freelancing (same reasons)
 I just want some honest optimism (only give me hopes of there&#x27;s any) and some ways how can I achieve what I want.
 Thanks &amp; Peace.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m trying to figure out some resources i can use to learn to code. I just started college for a cs degree, but I&#x27;d like to start learning on my own as well. Any websites/youtubers/books you guys would recommend? also I am trying to focus in AI and game development, any advice would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I do a lot of work with .NET and have always favored using VS over any other IDE. Obviously I cannot get this on Arch, but was curious as to better/as good free alternatives?
 UPDATE:
 After reading all your comments, I have decided to go with NeoVim as my IDE of choice. Thanks for the warm welcome into the Linux community reddit!!

                              <span>Why can&#x27;t it just work like a normal device? I avoid it like the plague. The one time I want to use it in a blue moon, surprise, it doesn&#x27;t work as expected.
 I have a Sony 1000XM4. It connected fine over Bluetooth, but the audio device doesn&#x27;t show up as an option. Thanks PipeWire..
 I am getting too old and tired of this. I can&#x27;t spend hours every time I want something simple to work to troubleshoot and find a solution. Maybe it is true that arch is for someone who has too much free time. I sure did at some point. 
 I expect to get downvoted and blamed for user error, and sure, maybe it is. But at what point does it become an OS/distro issue? for arch probably never.

                              <span>I&#x27;m refactoring some code that uses WPF mouse click event handlers.
 The issue is that the use of the event handler introduces misdirection, i.e. I connect the event Control.MouseMove +&#x3D; on_MouseMove which is not an immediate return. It&#x27;s more like a &quot;promise we will detect a mouse move&quot; in the future. Instead I need something like var inputresult &#x3D; Control.GatherInputs() switch { } where I can switch on the next user inputs.

                              <span>I was trying to make a simulated banking system for educational purposes.
 (just a educational project, please never save passwords unsafe like in this example)
 I planned to use .json as filetype to store the users their balance etc.
 This is the formatting I want:
 {
 &quot;userid&quot;: {
 &quot;username&quot;: &quot;username123&quot;,
 &quot;password&quot;: &quot;password123&quot;,
 &quot;balance&quot;: &quot;320030&quot;,
 }
 Because now I can say json[userid] ... and get the selected users values directly.
 but instead it will give me this:
 {&quot;userid:&quot;username123&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;password123&quot;, &quot;balance&quot;: &quot;320030&quot;}
 And with this I cannot search for the user directly, or at least I don&#x27;t know how.
 I tried with newtonsoft already, also tried with indented formatting both didn&#x27;t deliver the wanted result.

                              <span>I am trying to add functionality to a listview so i can interact with it in a mvvm manner. I want to be able to long press an item in the listview, this should enable multiple selection mode so i can select multiple items. After i am done i want to press a button that saves that selection.
 How would i approach this, do i need to make my own listview? Can i just add the behavior to the existing listview?
 Any suggestions or ideas?

There was one a few days ago, again about someone working years on a game and somehow they can&#x27;t figure out the most obvious. That it never was the marketing or the fanbase. But that the game just wasn&#x27;t something people wanted to play.

 People need to stop thinking of marketing and fanbases as reasons why people want to play your game. It&#x27;s a multiplier, a catalyst to the existing product. It can only do so much to your game. The amount of time before a great game is discovered by the masses can be greatly re…</span>

                              <span>I am the only developer at a company thats in the tech space kind of but not in software industry. They wanted to have an in house developer that could work: - on consulting on client projects for which the software development will be done by a partner - Product R&amp;D - Internal stuff
 I only took this job a month ago because I moved to a different city and was looking for 3-4 months and couldn&#x27;t find another one because of some other reasons rather than there being no jobs. 
 I did tell them that we have to manage our expectations regarding the timeline of the project since there are a lot of components that are going to take time and I&#x27;m the only developer on this. 
 Then a few days ago this guy says that he wants me to give a timeline for this which is understandable i guess. I am also starting to work on another project with a partner and I have to do both at the same time. 
 What would be a good way of saying that it will take 1.5 to 2 months, I am the only developer on this doing the work of multiple people and even if you find another guy that will create this product MVP in less time, he&#x27;s definitely not going to do this for the same salary. 
 Not sure about the last part. I have 3 YOE working at a startup and another company with amazing folks who understood rushing features and projects doesn&#x27;t end up well.

                              <span>Has anyone dealt with a developer who is out to get you on PR reviews? She will create discussions for every tiny thing with often little benefit. For the sake of an example variable naming causing lengthy discussions. Every approach i take she will argue for almost the exact opposite and its tiring. I realise that this brings benefit, and rubber stamping them without thought is also bad but has anyone been in a similar situation before or can offer some guidance? 
 She does this to other devs often not backing down on minor disagreements where either way would work and im sensing its causing the team morale to suffer. 
 Im 15yoe working in a startup environment.

                              <span>Ever since AI has hit the scene, we have been having issues where developers blame mistakes they are making on the AI generating the wrong code.
 I have people saying &quot;oh well chatgpt generated it wrong&quot; when a bug reaches prod instead of being accountable to their own work. And they can&#x27;t debug their own work because they don&#x27;t understand how it works either, so I have to troubleshoot it as well.
 Another issue I have is during code reviews, people cannot explain why they wrote their code a certain way. They just say &quot;that&#x27;s what chatgpt output&quot;. And it&#x27;s usually just several long functions with minimal thought going into the design or how it will work in the bigger picture. One project is using 3 or 4 different libraries for making http requests at this point because chatgpt isn&#x27;t consistent in which it uses and devs arent checking to see what is already in place. 
 The other thing people started doing is responding with a copy paste from chatgpt explaining the design when answering my PR comments. Even if the explanation feels nonsensical from my perspective, they just copy paste spam clearly generated replies until I give up and pass the review over to someone else.
 Ive talked to my boss but hes drunk on AI hype and thinks this is the future. I explain these issues but he thinks I am just trying to force people into doing things the old way. His favorite thing to say is that people originally opposed using compilers and wanted to hand write assembly for a long time, which i find pretty annoying. How can I get people to start using their brains again and stop abusing this program? I feel like I am going crazy.

                              <span>We are migrating to OTel and reviewing our current observability vendors for potential replacements and/or consolidation. We have a combined 7 figure bill and have substantial metrics/logs (but no traces yet) volume. While we migrate and set up POCs with vendors, I wanted us to also have something hosted on our infra we can use internally (probably internally only on my team while we navigate the OTel implementation).
 There seem to be so many observability tools now, which is a good thing. I&#x27;d like to find one that is OSS, easy to set up and maintain, and supports OTel. Features are a simple UI that we can use to easily query and that can clearly show the data. Also, we don&#x27;t use k8s, mostly EC2 VMs and ECS containers. Any recommendations? Thanks!

                              <span>BACKGROUND
 I&#x27;ve been a (Windows) software developer a long time (decades) and now work, by choice, in DevOps
 My responsibility has been a set of important corporate legacy apps running on Windows (.Net/IIS/SQLServer)
 Everything is on AWS and deployed via Jenkins/Terraform/Ansible/PowerShell scripts, all under source control
 I&#x27;m dealing with Linux systems more and more as components of the old system are rewritten/replaced
 CURRENT ISSUE
 I&#x27;m finding writing Linux BASH equivalents of Windows PowerShell scripts frustrating
 BASH feels like Windows Command line (BAT) in comparison to PowerShell. Ancient, arcane, not a proper &quot;language&quot;
 Having learned Groovy through its use in Jenkins it seems like a great option. Modern, proper &quot;language&quot;. How can BASH compete with the power of {closure}.delegate?
 But it looks like Groovy has had its day and other than Jenkins isn&#x27;t widely used. r/Groovy is nearly dead
 (I also have the prospect of our DevOps stack being moved to GitLab in future)
 What would you suggest is a way forward that maximizes my learning effort? (And my learning becomes my teaching for juniors in the department)
 A) Learn BASH. It IS a proper language once you understand it. Its never going away, the skill will always be in demand
 B) Use Groovy. Rumours of its demise are greatly exaggerated.
 C) Get PowerShell on the Linux nodes It&#x27;s cross-platform for this exact reason. It&#x27;s &#x27;widely&#x27; used (in both Windows and Linux world) The Linux DevOps might roll their eyes but f&amp;*k those insular assholes
 D) Learn &quot;XYZ Language&quot; (eg PYTHON?) - that&#x27;s the thing that fills this gap you&#x27;re describing and will remain so for a decent amount of time. How did you not know this?
 E) Something else... tell me, eg &quot;Stop thinking like a developer... DevOps coding is different to Application coding&quot; (we&#x27;re gonna have an argument about this are we? ;)
 Because this is Windows v Linux I&#x27;m expecting trolls, but I really appreciate any serious replies

                              <span>I work at a big tech company. I have 2 YoE at this company. This was my first and only SWE job. Over the last few weeks the internship program at my company has started, and our team got one as well. They did a short introduction with the team, and it surprised me to find out he had more YoE than I did at our company. He had previously gotten a Bachelors degree in his home country and worked at the local branch of our company for 3 years. Then he came to the US to pursue a Masters degree, and decided to apply to the internship program with the US office. 
 I guess this is what recruiters mean when they post intern job postings with 1+ YoE required.

                              <span>With the introduction of the Recall feature for Windows, there is renewed interest in the Linux desktop. With that renewed interest, comes renewed hate toward the Linux desktop by people who feel personally confronted by the privacy + freedom oriented philosophy most Linux users subscribe to.
 &quot;Privacy doesn&#x27;t matter to me&quot; is the common response.
 That is fine. What should matter to users is reliance. Plenty of potential Linux users forgoe the switch because their favorite big tech software doesn&#x27;t run on Linux.
 &quot;I have built spreadsheets that don&#x27;t open in LibreOffice/OpenOffice&quot;
 &quot;I need Adobe to edit pictures/create music/read my DRM protected books&quot;
 These are statements that should give you pause. Is it acceptable that you are reliant on a piece of software to the extent that it ties you to an operating system and set of apps that could be taken away from you at any second? Let us focus on the first statement; how much will you pay for Excel (either in cash or your privacy) so that you can continue editing your favorite spreadsheet? Is there a point at which you would force yourself to learn how to program or translate these spreadsheets into LibreOffice?
 You may not care about Privacy or Freedom, but Microsoft and Apple will at some point set a price that will have you wishing you were Independent.
 No one who switches to Linux should expect the transition to be easy. There will be quirks on your system that you will have to iron out and there are just fundamental differences between Windows and Linux that you will have to get used to. In other words you will need to learn. If you think that is a waste of time, that&#x27;s fine. In my eyes, and in many others&#x27;, learning a new skill is never a waste if time.
 I hope this provides a useful perspective.

                              <span>I have an internship and it&#x27;s great. We develop software systems for automated vehicles. I am learning so much about CS and programming. They have me fixing bugs: there&#x27;s a bug tracking system and I have access to the proprietary bug list, then I try to fix the code. It&#x27;s super interesting. Obviously we don&#x27;t make this public or use some open source tracker because there&#x27;s a lot at stake even if it&#x27;s just a simple thing like going over the speed limit once in a while. One time the system was turning on the windshield wipers in clear weather and turning them off in rain. We thought that was hilarious. 
 So, we have this restricted area where there&#x27;s a test track. We have to test the vehicles in a controlled environment very very thoroughly. A little while ago the test engineers became very stressed and agitated. We tried to find out why because they were mostly really smart nerds who left us alone. I was processing the bug list and I found a system video from a video where the test car ran over a kitty cat. I asked around and that was why the test engineers were so upset. It obviously wasn&#x27;t their fault: after I studied the logs I figured out how a particular function misidentified the cat and failed to avoid it. The function had several logic errors in the way shapes and movement were processed. Now I have to decide what to do about it. I can fix it quietly, like I usually do. I could tell my boss or make an entry in the bug tracker that the function was programmed wrong. That could get back to the AI Vision Manager and she could be really mad. Someone could be fired over it. I don&#x27;t want to make people mad at me. The bug is fixed. I think I should forget about it so I can have a good relationship with my coworkers and no one gets fired. I want to get an offer after I graduate.

I use emulators and I love them, but I want to make a emulator that can emulate pc hardware. Like a 5th gen i5 and simple gpu to run pc apps/exe files. Is there a way on how to do this.

                              <span>I had trouble signing into a Hotmail account with Evolution from the repo. Hotmail now requires Oauth2. And that option wasn&#x27;t available in Evolution in the repo.
 So I got a Flatpak instead. https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Evolution
 After you&#x27;ve set up your account, make sure it is on Oauth2. Right-click your account-name/Mail-address-&gt;Properties. Receiving e-mail, on the left. Botton right, Authentication. It should say Oauth2 (outlook) and NOT Password.
 This might work for Google mail too. Came across some threads on Oauth troubles on that subject too. Couldn&#x27;t really find anything that would fix it for Hotmail.
 So if you suffer from having to create new passwords every couple days, can&#x27;t login via Evolution etc, now you know why.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to build myself a router/firewall based on Debian, with the usual: nftables, dhcp, dns, ...
 The IPv4 part isn&#x27;t a problem, done it a few times before.
 However, it&#x27;s the first time I want to implement ipv6 too, since I recently started to use some dedicated servers in the cloud which only have an IPv6 address, so need to be able to access them.
 I&#x27;ve been reading up and googling, but can&#x27;t seem to find a comprehensive overview of what I would need to do to achieve what I want.
 I know Kea DHCP has a DHCPv6. I know radvd is often used to work with router announcements etc.
 I&#x27;m in the position where I can use prefix delegation with my ISP.
 ​
 So basically, what would I need to do to implement the following:
  
I have VLAN&#x27;s on the lan-side, I want to make sure that some have IPv6 addresses, others don&#x27;t.
 I want to be able to work with fixed IPv6 addresses, so that I can configure nftables rules like &quot;this whole vlan has no internet access, however IPv6 address A.B.C.D.E.F in this vlan does have internet access&quot;. Basically, I need to be able to pin hosts to the same addresses every time and use those in nftables rules.
 I would prefer something which isn&#x27;t depending on my ISP who might change their prefix delegation at some point in time. I&#x27;m aware that IPv6 has a range for internal addresses, fc00::/7 address block. If I would need this, how would I implement this? Is this in combination with IPv6 NAT, which doesn&#x27;t seem recommended?
 If the outcome is that I do need IPv6 NAT&#x27;ing: what would be needed to implement this?
  
​
 Looking forward to your feedback, I hope there are people on here who have done this before and provide some guidance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to do a minimal Gnome install, so I installed gnome-core. However it includes a few packages I don&#x27;t care about, such as totem, gnome-sushi, yelp. But uninstalling those also tries to uninstall gnome-core.
 My first thought was to create a new deb package called gnome-core-overrides that includes those 3 packages in the &quot;provides&quot; field, but that didn&#x27;t work. Neither did including it in the &quot;replaces&quot; field. This reddit comment implies this is possible, but it&#x27;s not working for me. I also followed the steps from this tutorial.
 I also tried creating blank packages called totem, gnome-sushi, yelp, but when installing them, apt tries to be smart and tells me it&#x27;s going to install the repo version rather than my local .deb file. I didn&#x27;t try installing it directly with dpkg though, maybe that&#x27;s worth a try (but even then, this wouldn&#x27;t be my preferred way since then I would have to create a dummy deb for each package I don&#x27;t want).

                              <span>I think I&#x27;ve done something very stupid. I was trying to configure a backup server so that when powered on it would automatically backup another computer and then shutdown. I created a systemd command to run on startup that would run an rysnc command and then poweroff. Unfortunately whenever I turn on the server it does not run the rsync command and just shutdowns after around 15 seconds. The server no longer stays on long enough to ssh in. Have I screwed myself?

Was trying to shrink a windows Ntfs partition to make room for an ext4 partition and this happened. Is all my data going to be ok and I just have to wait (it’s been about 2 hours) or am I just gonna have to wipe my SSD?

                              <span>I mean art styles like in the below album. I love graphics like this and I always wondered, were these graphics hand drawn, or were they the result of photos imported at low resolution?
 Was this art style popular by choice, or was it influenced by the technical limitations of the engines at the time?
 Was there a specific popular engine or rendering software responsible for this style similar to how Unity is used today?
 Can this art style be replicated with modern tools? If so, what software?
 Are there any contemporary games that use a similar art style?
 Here&#x27;s an album with some screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/late-90s-early-2000s-pc-graphics-pISFrYA

                              <span>Hi! I wrote a dc clone, but my code kinda sucks. I&#x27;m starting to refactor it, and I&#x27;d like to hear some tips from experienced C programmers on how to write better code.
 https://github.com/distobs/dc/tree/rewrite // this is the refactor branch, I started it yesterday and there&#x27;s still a lot to go. the master branch is worse.
 Thank you for your time!

                              <span>Libimobiledevice is a open source program Witten in c language. It can be installed on Mac using &quot;brew install libimobiledevice&quot;. When brew does is installs precompiles bimaties for this and all it&#x27;s dependencies. And these are linked with each other via information stored in .dylib files. But problem is that brew compiled code is outdated, and I need to recompile it each time using &quot;brew install --head libimobiledevice&quot;. What my problem is that whenever I want to run this on another Mac I have to install all the dev tools and after that I can install it. I want a way to compile these ao whenever I copy binaries to another Mac they work out of the box. I have tried to understand how autogen.sh, make and make install work. But I am just succeeding in spinning my head. It will be very helpful if someone can leave a tip or point to resources I should look at.

                              <span>Hi, I read about aliasing rules, but I&#x27;m confused about compatible types. So I wonder, is this code UB and why?
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;C struct IpAddr { unsigned char a, b, c, d; } struct IpAddrWithPort { unsigned char a, b, c, d; int port; } void print_addr(IpAddr&amp; addr) { .. }
 int main() { IpAddrWithPort addr &#x3D; { 127, 0, 0, 1, 8080 }; print_addr((&amp;IpAddr) (&amp;addr)); } &#x60;&#x60; It seems like it isn&#x27;t to me because logically memory address ofIpAddrWithPortwould always be validIpAddr&#x60; address and there isn&#x27;t second reference, so it isn&#x27;t aliased at all. But what is the formal way to think about it?

 -- Findings of a Die Hard C programmer.
  
TL;DR: The standard should outright disallow the use of register keyword if an object (or member of a nested sub-object) can be accessed as an array; doing so should cause a hard constraint violation, instead of just undefined behavior.
 The register storage-class specifier prohibits taking the address of a variable, and doing so causes compilation error due to a constraint violation. The standard also contains this informative footnote (not normative):

                              <span>hi!
 I want to use open gl to draw a graph according to the year of manufacture of some cars. The problem is that when, in the console, the user enters the car he wants to buy, the code opens the graphic window, and after closing the graphic window appears the rest in the console! I think it&#x27;s from the break instruction, but I don&#x27;t know how to fix this, can someone help me? I use eclipse and the code portion is:
 printf(&quot;enter the car you want to buy:&quot;);
 fflush(stdout);
 scanf(&quot;%s&quot;,marcac);
 if (marcac[0] &gt;&#x3D; &#x27;a&#x27; &amp;&amp; marcac[0] &#x3D;2014){
 printf(&quot;Congratulations! You bought the %s car from the year %d for the price: %.2f&quot;,m[i].marca
 ,m[i].an_fabricatie,m[i].pret);
 }
 else{
 fscanf(parcauto_out,&quot;%s %f&quot;,m[i].marca,&amp;m[i].reducere);
 printf(&quot;Congratulations! You bought the %s car from the year %d for the price: %.2f&quot;
 &quot;,iar pretul final:%.2f!&quot;,m[i].marca,m[i].an_fabricatie,m[i].pret,m[i].reducere);
 }
 break;
 }}
 if(i&#x3D;&#x3D;nrm){
 printf(&quot;%s it is not in the car park!\n&quot;,marcac);
 } printf(&quot;\\n\\tbye!\\n&quot;); 
 fclose(parcauto\_out); 
 fclose(parcauto\_in); 
 glutInit(&amp;argc, argv);
 glutInitWindowSize(320, 320);
 glutInitWindowPosition(50, 50);
 glutCreateWindow(&quot;Histograma OpenGL &quot;);
 glutDisplayFunc(display);
 glutMainLoop();
 return 0;
 the program only displays: &quot;enter the car you want to buy:&quot; and then the graphic window opens and after closing the window, what remains to be written continues

                              <span>I used to DESPISE coding because I joined CS for the money. (keeping it real)
 Literally would sit down and try to learn languages like Java, Python, HTML/CSS.
 Couldn’t do it because it was so boring.
 What I did to fix this was literally hop on structured learning platforms like Sololearn (free) and Codecademy ($150/year).
 Then of course it still wouldn’t work. 
 Same thing would happen, I would just continue to procrastinate and feel bored.
 To combat this, I simply screen recorded myself coding and explaining what I was doing.
 Then I uploaded those videos onto YouTube.
 Knowing that I was being recorded made me focus more and building an audience on YouTube doing this (you would be surprised) kept me motivated to keep coding.
 This is also something you could eventually monetize, but even if your YT doesn’t grow, you’ll learn how to code and program.
 I hope this helped a few of you. I wish someone introduced this to me a long time ago.
 Good luck everyone!

                              <span>Hello! I am looking for any suggestions involving the code for my final project for software engineering 1. The goal of this project was to create a boolean expression solver. Any comments, suggestions, critiques are welcome. I did everything except for the abstract syntax tree class (ast.cpp and ast.h) therefore I am not interested in any critiques involving the code in those files, but everything else is fair game (including the readme and the cmakelists.txt). This was my first time using cmake.
 I do have one question, though. We received a 98/100 on the project, with two points being deducted. The TA stated that using a makefile instead of cmake would be better, and that it would &quot;greatly simplify and improve the build process&quot;. Do you guys agree with this statement or have any thoughts on it? Thank you very much for any responses.

                              <span>For me, it was how to overload operator&#x3D;, operator&#x3D;&#x3D; and copy constructor.
 Before I learned how to properly overload those, I would often write methods such as Foo::SetEqual(const Foo&amp; other) , Foo::Equals(const Foo&amp; other) and Foo::CopyFrom(const Foo&amp; other), and then call those instead of using operators.

                              <span>C++ Quiz question 287 highlighted a very confusing design choice in the C++ standard. 
 constexpr basic_string( const basic_string&amp; other, size_type pos, const Allocator&amp; alloc &#x3D; Allocator() ); constexpr basic_string( const CharT* s, size_type count, const Allocator&amp; alloc &#x3D; Allocator() ); 
 The first constructs a string with the substring [pos, end).
 The second constructs a string with the substring [begin, count).
 Why do these two constructors for basic_string have such different meaning for nearly identical format?

                              <span>Many C++ programmers refer to Rust as a &#x27;&#x27;religion&#x27;&#x27;or &#x27;&#x27;cult,&#x27;&#x27; but from what I&#x27;ve seen, whether on YouTube, Reddit, or Google, there&#x27;s a strong consensus that Rust excels in various aspects, such as memory safety, concurrency, and promoting more careful consideration of memory usage and pointers. The only advantage I currently see for C++ is its libraries and frameworks. As a C++ programmer, could you tell me why you stick with C++ instead of switching to Rust, given that Rust outshines it in many areas? (If it&#x27;s because of job prospects, you don&#x27;t need to comment.) i just wanna know your opinion.

                              <span>I’m at my first job, already a year in. I’m currently not liking it. I just don’t like that they don’t use stls or even c++ features and instead it’s mostly written like c++98 or C really. I like working in c++, python, and even rust. How are the opportunities in those languages, especially in c++?

 std::cout.imbue(std::locale(&quot;en_US.utf8&quot;));
 But I keep getting this error:
 locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid
 I&#x27;ve tried other locale names like en_US, en-US, en_US.UTF-8, en_US.UTF8 but the error persists.
 Also I&#x27;ve previously used
 infile.imbue(std::locale(&quot;en_US.UTF8&quot;));
 in another project (infile here is an std::wifstream), and it worked fine.
 How can I fix this?
 Edit: I&#x27;m on Windows

My game code isn&#x27;t relevant to the problem so I won&#x27;t publish it here; it&#x27;s in a near blank state.
 P.S: I use msys2 in ucrt64 mode in Windows 11 if it matters it probably does not.
 P.P.S: If it would be helpful I can share the make output with -d
 The error:

                              <span>I am a (pre-)junior developer. My question is whether cpp will still be used in the future or whether it will soon basically become esoteric compared to rust? Otherwise, what is the point in trying to really learn ol’ cpp in 2024? I quite want to learn cpp but have been multiple times increasingly warned about the risk of focusing too much on any non-rust(-ish) language due to high risk of becoming legacy code imminently since rust integrated into Linux kernel, for one…
 EDIT: for clarification, what I am seeking I guess is some reassurance as to whether there is any hope for cpp continuing to exist as an employable language for much longer given the features described to be available in rust such as safe memory management, crates, thriving community, innovative style and so on?

 Somehow, my reversedpart function changes the reversedhead value to the end of the reversed list rather than to the start of it. The tail logic should be fine though. When I put in the test case in example 1 (the one above) the value of the reversedhead pointer changed to 2 rather than 4. Any idea why? Help is much appreciated.

 The only difference i could find was the preprocessor statements. in his Hazel project it said &quot;_WINDLL&quot; while mine said &quot;_DEBUG;_CONSOLE&quot; and inside the Sandbox project his says &quot;_MBCS&quot; and mine: &quot;_DEBUG;_CONSOLE&quot;
 Also I&#x27;m using VS2022 and i think he is using VS2019 but I&#x27;m not sure.

 SYNOPSIS gcc [-c|-S|-E] [-std&#x3D;standard] [-g] [-pg] [-Olevel] [-Wwarn...] [-Wpedantic] [-Idir...] [-Ldir...] [-Dmacro[&#x3D;defn]...] [-Umacro] [-foption...] [-mmachine-option...] [-o outfile] [@file] infile.. 
 Shouldn&#x27;t I put all my .cpp files at the end of the command line?
 PS: I use WSL under Windows 10.

 To support me in reaching a wider audience, my wife developed an app featuring free quizzes and paid blogs on C++20 for iOS devices, including iPhone, iPad, and Vision Pro. You can download the app here: C++20 Quiz and Blog App.
 The Long Story
 Some of you may know me from my blogs on Medium and my YouTube videos about modern C++. For over two years, I’ve been creating content focused on C++20 features, driven by my passion for teaching and modern C++. However, despite my efforts, the financial return has been minimal due to high competition and the need for consistent content posting to meet monetization thresholds.
 Living with my wife in a metropolitan city in Germany comes with substantial monthly expenses. Like many developers, we work full-time jobs, and I dedicate my free ti…</span>

                              <span>Hi, I am a Software Engineering Undergraduate going into my final year at University in the UK.
 I cannot get myself to code any projects outside of uni assignments at all. It is a mix of not having an idea of what project to take on, and then motivation to actually do that project.
 I just gave up on an alphabet game designed for toddlers where you have to click the correct next letter in the alphabet to finish the game (at ‘Z’) because I got extremely bored as I knew I could do it, and knew I wouldn’t really get satisfaction from it being finished.
 I know that to go into the industry I need a portfolio of projects I have done to show my future employers, so I’ve come here for advice - what should I do about this issue?
 I am open to suggestions on a) project ideas, b) motivation ideas, and c) anything people can give about their own experiences with this.

                              <span>Every good software engineer or tech lead I have taken advice from has given me the same recommendation: Instead of going through video tutorials and replicating them, choose an idea and build it. Go through the documentation, browse Stack Overflow, and struggle to build your project. It&#x27;s okay to write subpar code in the beginning. Build the project first, then fix and optimize the code later. This process will help you become a better engineer.
 Expert engineers, what are your thoughts on this advice? Is it good? Is there anything you would like to add?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I am new--on chapter 5 of automate the boring stuff. I ran into an issue where my code was producing unexpected results, but not crashing.
 I considered adding print() statements in my code, but I thought it would be hard to toggle all of them on and off using individual comments. Then I thought I might use a Boolean variable, and if that variable was True, it would allow all the print() functions to fire. But this adds a lot of lines of code to a project, 1 line for the if statement and then another line for the print. So that&#x27;s 2 lines every time I want to check, and if I have 50 things I want to check that&#x27;s 100 extra lines of code.
 I don&#x27;t know what this is called but I feel like being able to print out the precise steps a program is executing is important information and I haven&#x27;t seen it discussed in the book yet. 
 My IDE is Notepad++. I am specifically using Notepad++ because it doesn&#x27;t have any autocomplete and it forces me to type everything out by hand--but I&#x27;m wondering if another IDE might have something that allows this print() debugging thing to be easier for me.
 Thank you.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m slowly looking into getting into web development using C#. I&#x27;m a C# beginner but trying to learn how to apply my current knowledge into web development (any advice or pointers would be appreciated :) ). The one issue that I&#x27;m struggling with is understanding the difference between Blazor and ASP.NET and when should I choose one over the other. It seems like ASP.NET is the older and battle tested framework while Blazor is the new(er) kid on the block. Blazor seems (I might be wrong) easier to learn and has more eye candy/UX type stuff in it.
 I&#x27;m cautious about picking it up because it seems like the big thing that I got out of reading this sub is that Microsoft has a habit of releasing a new technology/framework and then abandoning it if it doesn&#x27;t get enough traction. Is that something that I should be concerned about with using a newer technology like Blazor? Or has Blazor received enough traction that the chances of that happening are low? Or does it not even matter because the skill sets and code are transferable between the two?

                              <span>So am I correct in my understanding that entity is a framework which makes things easier however it runs on ado.net the same as how blazor runs asp.net? Is there any other key details I should know about what the difference between the two are? My understanding is that entity is used for crud apps and may be quicker than ado.net but a bit of less control.

                              <span>I want to access (read and write) data to our company&#x27;s sharepoint site (document libraries for a start). We are a small company that uses the standard sharepoint that comes with M365. 
 The mvc app already uses the M365 authentication (AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp) which is also the way to connect to sharepoint. So I thought, this should not be a problem...
 I&#x27;ve been digging around the internet for some time on how to integrate/access sharepoint from my app, and tried graphservice client without any luck. It is so hard to find good examples for my case, due the various versions of the technologies over time. So you spent hours with an example from the web just to learn that is does not work with .net core.
 Can you guys point me in the right direction on how to establish the connection to sharepoint? What technology should I use (graph, rest api). What works best for you?

 I renamed the grid to mainGrid already but it still gives me an error. I also have no idea what&#x27;s wrong with the InitializeComponent(). It works fine when i start it

                              <span>I&#x27;m running .NET 4.8 WinForms Net Framework with an uptodate VS 2022 Version 17.10 on an uptodate Windows 11. I have a ListView with two columns and two rows and it&#x27;s showing details view. I&#x27;ve set FullRowSelect &#x3D; true and MultiSelect &#x3D; false.
 I&#x27;ve got an event triggering on SelectIndexChanged. This is the code for the event handler.
 private void listView1_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
 {
 var count&#x3D; (listView1.SelectedIndices.Count);
 MessageBox.Show($&quot;Count&#x3D;{count}&quot;);
 }
 Nothing else except the Form constructor which does InitilizeComponent as you&#x27;d expect.
 When I run it and first click a row it pops up a Count&#x3D;1, as you&#x27;d expect. If I now click another row it pops up a Count&#x3D;0 then when I close the MessageBox it immediately pops up a Count &#x3D;1. I did not expect the Count&#x3D;0. I also get the same behavious with SelectedItems.Count.

Only answers I can find for knowing when a stream&#x27;s end is reached is related to NetworkStreams, but I&#x27;m working with a FileStream, and none of the answers seem to work with the base Stream class. I would assume there&#x27;s some way to know when no more data can be read from a file.

                              <span>At the Microsoft Build event a couple days ago, a presentation suggested that for Win32 development, your choices were WinUI 3 and WPF. I had always thought that for Windows desktop development (which is what I&#x27;m interested in), WPF was for C#, needed .NET, and needed a Pinvoke every time you called a native Win32 function. 
 I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s my own fault, but I had a hard time understanding the presenters, and I am still not clear on whether something has changed to allow you to use WPF for native C++ Win32 applications. Can anyone clarify this?

                              <span>Hey! Hope you’re all well. Coming out of college and not really wanting to pursue a career in regard to my A levels, I decided to pursue a career in programming given that I’ve always been a computer guy despite not having any previous programming experience.
 I feel I understand the gist of how to go about learning programming and doing in such a way that irregardless of the language I use/end up using I can problem solve and program well (or relatively so). From what I have seen/heard from self taught devs on YT and other places, a lot of problems arise from not understanding the underlying principles of programming and people end up falling in the false sense of security knowing that a piece of code works and not why it works. Or trying to rush their way through and finish and quick as …</span>

                              <span>The main issue with Rust is that it&#x27;s not fast to iterate - when it compiles it runs, but your logic may be wrong, and then you may need to change your stuff and make it correct again. However, the performance is over the roof and it&#x27;s memory safe - performance and memory-safety are two hard to combine features
 Clojure is in a completely different place: it&#x27;s BLAZINGLY fast to iterate, but - and now, this is probably because I&#x27;m a total newb in Clojure - it&#x27;s pretty weird to try to squeeze super performance out of it. It&#x27;s performant alright, but it&#x27;s no Rust/C++, and can probably never be, since it&#x27;s garbage-collected and has some decently costed abstractions
 So I think where I want to be is to have good mastery of both languages: using Rust for anything that needs to have high-performance or for low level stuff, and Clojure as the day-to-day tool to jack-in and hack away
 Now, I don&#x27;t have enough knowledge of language design to understand how viable it would be, but it&#x27;d be pretty neat to have Clojure doing interop with Rust - you jack-in into a Rust program, invoke and break Rust functions in the REPL, iterate adding stuff; when you&#x27;re done you compile the experiments into Rust code and make it Rust-compilable. That&#x27;s a dream

                              <span>Hollo, Rustacians! 
 I&#x27;m a backend developer, and I mainly use Go. I had read the Rust Book multiple times before, as I find it be insightful and interesting. Last week I had some free time, so I decided to work on my first actual project in Rust. It was a simple HTTP server. 
 Overall, it was a fun experience. The type system is powerful. I felt at home with defining types and attaching methods to them. Enums are great as well. The Option type for gracefully handling null values and the Result type for more flexible error handling. It was satisfying to refactor my code to remove cloning or to use ? for early returns.
 Although, I found the compiler to be too much in the way. At some points, my speed grinded to a halt, trying to understand what I did wrong and how should I fix it. Granted, I&#x27;m new, and it&#x27;s only natural to face such problems. But in many cases, I had to alter the solution I had in my mind to match what the compiler expected of me, which required so much mental energy. It was challenging in a fun way, but my productivity plummeted.
 Now that I&#x27;m fairly done with the project, it feels like I&#x27;m missing something about Rust. Surely, I&#x27;ll continue to use it for my side projects, but I don&#x27;t get the hype around it. What makes it so great? Is it just the challenge of writing more idiomatic code and constant refactoring, or is there something that Rust does that I&#x27;m not appreciating?

                              <span>Hey r/rust community,
 We&#x27;ve been working on an exciting project reverse engineering Nier: Automata using Ghidra and Rust. Here are some highlights:
 Project Highlights:
  
Ghidra Integration: Utilizing Ghidra to decompile and analyze the game.
 Rust Bindings: Creating automatic bindings from Ghidra to Rust.
 Vtables Exploration: Examining and manipulating virtual tables to understand the game&#x27;s object-oriented components.
  
This project offers a deep dive into game mechanics and engine architecture, translating low-level code into safe, high-performance Rust code.
 We use that to add Online-PVP to the game which never had that planned!
 Getting Involved:
 If you&#x27;re interested in contributing or discussing further, feel free to reach out. We&#x27;re open to collaboration with enthusiasts experienced in reverse engineering and Rust.
 Looking forward to your thoughts and potential collaboration!

                              <span>I&#x27;m beginning to use Rust for my PhD research, which I hope to take and form a company with. As I&#x27;m porting Python code that I&#x27;ve written in numpy, opencv, and ONNX, I have been running into some missing methods and packages. I&#x27;m using ndarray, twistedfall/opencv, and ort. With this set, I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m missing fairly low level functions, like bilinear interpolation, calculating eigenvectors and similar. I know that some of my issues can be addressed by pulling in nalgebra. I&#x27;m concerned that Rust is not mature enough for this kind of work. What are other people&#x27;s experiences/recommendations in this space?

Then the secondary board which is also where the power socket plugs into and lastly my absolutely destroyed tweezers from removing the RF shields. I don&#x27;t know what I expected but I overestimated myself. I can not identify any pads or places to solder anything to. If you have any suggestions, let me know and I&#x27;ll try them!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently been interested in possibly loading a custom firmware on my Alexa as I started caring about privacy. The issue is, this is the 3rd gen Alex echo show 5 which runs their custom OS instead of Android like their old ones. I&#x27;ve been searching online but haven&#x27;t seen anything and most people said that there isn&#x27;t a fastboot menu in this thing. After playing around with it though, I found this! Done by pressing all 3 buttons on startup. However, I couldn&#x27;t find anything else from here. I&#x27;m not nearly proficient enough in programming and stuff to port android or Linux on this thing so I was hoping to at least get the information out there that there is a fastboot menu on these newer Alexa devices (I literally found nothing on the newer gen devices)

                              <span>That&#x27;s me again with yet another discussion provoking thread. Hopefully, based on the upvotes, this is fine :) 
 I have finally read all the responses in that thread about the tips for writing better code. A lot of people mentioned testing, but the opinions themselves were really different. 
 My recent project proved to me that unit tests are very tricky to get right. It&#x27;s very simple to write them and increase the coveted code coverage so that fellow devs can applaud and be confident that something good is happening. That said, a lot of tests are either meaningless in that they pass whatever what, or so flaky that maintaining them becomes such a burden that you just want to delete them. 
 Recently, it has happened several times that I just ditched all unit tests and mocks and fired testcontainers with a real PG instance. 
 Of course, unit tests have their place for business logic where no external dependencies are involved. In such cases, it also helps to use fuzzy testing and property-based testing. 
 Now I am rereading the wonderful article by Fowler on tests, but I am sure some of you might have a lot of insightful things to say on the topic.

 So far, I have not found much use for AI tools, but also didn&#x27;t really look for possible applications beyond letting ChatGPT create a starting point or so. However, a recent discussion in another sub made me think - am I missing out on some productivity boosts? So, fellow devs, which AI tools do you use in your daily work, and for what?

                              <span>I’ve been working as a jack of all trades in a startup in the battery field for the last 1.5 years. At first it was a good experience as I was able to work with both software and hardware, having a degree in mechatronics, managed to improve the product and got a semi-promotion (just title, no money, it was promised to arrive later) The honeymoon soon ended after 8 months when the business model revealed its flaws and new incompetent management stepped in and everything started to go downhill. 
 Now the situation is that 80% of our small software team has quit, nothing of what they had promised me materialized and the company is completely stuck and going backwards rather than forwards with R&amp;D. 
 I was severely frustrated and burnout so I handed in my notice period and I will be traveling for 6-12 months in the fall. I’m 26, I’ve 3 years of total work experience and no debt, hope this choice of traveling won’t backfire, but I need a break now. 
 After the traveling I want to work for a bigger company where there is more structure and hopefully a better career path, but as I’ve never worked for one before I hear contrasting experiences on what to expect. 
 Has any of you started their career in startups and then switched to bigger companies ? How was your experience?

                              <span>I have experience with huge corporate codebases in frontend only roles.
 I just started a new job at a more medium sized company and it’s full stack. I went in expecting my fundamentals and general programming skills to just transfer over, as well as many years of freelance experience where I spin up my own small backend projects. 
 Well it hasn’t gone well. This level of backend engineering is completely overwhelming to me and I’m expected to perform as a senior there. 
 I tried just taking tasks but it’s been a month now or really trying to learn that way and I don’t think it’s the way. I was thinking of watching videos online but I don’t know how well they can truly prepare you to a huge backend project. 
 What would you do? I

                              <span>Hi Folks, 
 Some time ago I wrote here on r/devops about my Google&#x27;s SRE, System Engineering Interview experience and questions they asked.
 For past month I was scraping interview questions for Amazon, Google, Meta, Netflix, Yahoo, Cloudflare, Accenture etc.. in various sources, filtering useful questions (imho) and rewriting them in more details with solutions. 
 publishing it here: https://prepare.sh/engineering/devops (if you&#x27;ll have issues with login please clean cookies)
 Also I will keep adding companies/question to have around 50+ top companies with their interview questions, so its work in progress.. If you find this type of content useful and want to help me with code/content/etc pls dm me :)

                              <span>Been out of market for sometime and applied few roles. But havent heard back from recruiting team yet. 
 Want to find out how the current DevOps market is right now? I know as a whole things are really slow, but some development roles are opening up a bit around the country.

                              <span>scenario:
 1)starting merging components into prod from staging/qa branch
 2) discovered conflict in one of the components in prod &gt; stging.
 3) reverted the merged branches to not break prod.
 4) revert doesn&#x27;t exist on github portal, need to create a new branch based on previous commit-then push it onto dev/stg, to be merged into prod. since prod is protected and i couldn&#x27;t push a commit into.
 5) then after conflicts resolved, could merge sqaush from stg to prod with the newest version.
 now, I&#x27;m guessing what i should have done(junior here, first time doing this), to avoid the revert part, is just using the drafted/review of PR(pull request), on all components to see if there are conflicts, and then I didn&#x27;t need to revert at all.
 any critical stuff i should avoid? 
 also is #4 common practice in such cases of protected master?
 general critic is welcome.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to wrap my head around the idea of struct types. I want to clarify something: a struct alone isn&#x27;t a type, right? Just like how there&#x27;s no array type but there is the int array of size one type or the string array of size two type and so on. For so long I&#x27;ve been thinking that a struct is a type and then there&#x27;s just different versions of it... and yeah these might be their own types but it was never a conscious thought in my mind... they both just blurred together.
 Here, https://imgur.com/a/UTUpZcN we can see that I&#x27;ve got the part highlighted. I&#x27;m declaring it in the long var way just to be clear about how the type is on the left of equals and the literal is on the right. The type sentient is simply a named type for that struct. But of course this makes a whole new type. Just like how I can have two floats be different types (one Celsius and another Fahrenheit) to keep them conceptually different. They couldn&#x27;t be combined. But really this is a convenience... structs in the end are all unique types based on the properties given... right?

I have no problems with understanding pointers itself and why they are used and what they are helping to achieve in code. However the moment syntax problems, really stops me, as right now I dot not have good understanding where to place * and where to place &amp;. Is there any tips or advices regarding it ?

                              <span>So I often think about this one time when I was installing Linux as a dual boot on my new computer. The installation would go smooth, but after logging in I couldn&#x27;t for the life of me get anything to show up. For example I was able to fire up a terminal, execute commands perfectly fine, no errors at all. But starting some applications wouldn&#x27;t work, they would show up in htop but I couldn&#x27;t see them. I spent a day debugging this and installed ~5 different distros but still found no solution.
 Being done I got up from my computer, turned on my TV and saw my desktop on the TV. The computer was connected to the TV via HDMI and would make it a primary display despite it being turned off... Having 5 years of experience with Linux I started exploring drivers, looking into logs etc. and it didn&#x27;t occur to me to check the connected displays.
 Do you have any stories with Linux where you turned out to be a complete idiot when in reality the solution was as simple as unplugging a cable?

                              <span>I wanted a quick refresher on Debian vs Ubuntu, and this is from one of the first results on Google.
 This probably seems only slightly Linux related, but I wouldn&#x27;t have expected it for articles about Linux. If the writers find these articles convincing, they don&#x27;t understand the topic, and if they don&#x27;t understand it they shouldn&#x27;t be writing about it. 
 I know real information is still available but this has really made the internet a garbage heap.

                              <span>Hi people, I recently saw some code that use hibernate mapping file, for mapping their domain entity directly without creating a JPA entity and I thought that was awesome.
 So here my question is a good idea use the old XML files for that?
 I think that is awesome but you are forced to use XML for that configuration.

 Anyone else have this issue? Any tips on dealing with it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a bootcamp dev. Everyone said after a few YOE the degree wouldn&#x27;t matter.
 I&#x27;m slowly finding out that is not true.
 I submitted hundreds of apps in the last few months. The last 500, I submitted a bogus app with an identical resume but different name / CS degree from UC Irvine.
 The bogus app already received 6 responses and I&#x27;m still sitting at 0. Just feeling really frustrated and mislead.

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting an error with a Pointer-to-member-function template parameter and I don&#x27;t understand why.
 I have this class
 template  class LogWrapper { T* obj; public: LogWrapper(T* obj_): obj(obj_){} std::ostream&amp; operator()(std::ostream&amp; os) const { return (obj-&gt;*F)(os); } }; 
 which works completely fine ; and this wrapper function :
 template  auto lmf_wrap(T* obj, std::ostream&amp;(T::*F)(std::ostream&amp;)){ //decltype(F)::foo &#x3D; 1; dirty trick I used to check F&#x27;s type return LogWrapper(obj); } 
 So, when I try to construct a LogWrapper, it works :
 LogWrapper(&amp;obj) //no errors cool 
 BUT trying to use the wrapper function instead
 lmf_wrap(&amp;obj, Object::method) 
 gives me this :
 include/Util/LMFWrapper.h: In instantiation of &#x27;auto lmf_wrap(T*, std::ostream&amp; (T::*)(std::ostream&amp;)) [with T &#x3D; Object; std::ostream &#x3D; std::basic_ostream]&#x27;: src/Display/GameGraphics.cpp:21:75: required from here include/Util/LMFWrapper.h:21:12: error: &#x27;F&#x27; is not a valid template argument for type &#x27;std::basic_ostream&amp; (Object::*)(std::basic_ostream&amp;)&#x27; 21 | return LogWrapper(obj); | ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ include/Util/LMFWrapper.h:21:12: note: it must be a pointer-to-member of the form &#x27;&amp;X::Y&#x27; 
 Which I don&#x27;t really understand, because I checked and in lmf_wrap&#x27;s body (right before the faulty line 21), F&#x27;s type is std::ostream&amp; (Object::*)(std::ostream&amp;) and I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s exactly what the template needs ? 
 Anyone has any idea ?

                              <span>Greetings to all r/cpp members! First of all, I would like to say that I’ve been in software development for a decade and haven’t used C++ as a main programming language. Been working with PHP for a pretty long period of time. Let’s start with the task I am working on and what problem I have got and want to tackle in the best way possible.
 Recently, I have reminded myself a project I have been working in university - Trains Schedule. Main functions had to be: - Show trains schedule - Search among various filters - CRUD
 So I have decided to rework on that using Raylib with a GUI instead of console. Wanted to fancy fonts, SFX and stuff.
 Problem came from place where I didn’t though of - Config class. Because config file contains fonts settings, sfx settings, misc, etc.
 How do I properly do a Config class to be able to be used among various classes without a need of re-reading a config file?
 Would really appreciate some constructive feedback on this matter.
 Regards.

                              <span>I was rereading the wording for  and assuming I am reading this part correctly, instantiating std::uniform_int_distribution is just flat out UB.
 Am I reading the requirements correctly? Because if so, the wording is absurd. If there was a reason to avoid instantiating std::uniform_int_distribution (or one of the other places with this requirements), it could&#x27;ve been made just ill-formed, as the stdlib implementations can check this with a simple static_assert, rather than technically allowing the compiler to do whatever.
 If the goal was to allow implementations to make choices that wouldn&#x27;t work with some types, UB is still terrible choice for that; it should&#x27;ve been either unspecified or implementation-defined.

 i&#x27;ll be happy with a supervision or collaboration in this project or just help me with one of those problems this is my project&#x27;s repository : https://github.com/AbdelhakBen922/SchoolManagementSystem

                              <span>I recently started learning programming (started about a month ago). I chose C++ as my first language and currently going through DSA. I don&#x27;t think I know even barely enough to love or hate this language though I am enjoying learning it. 
 During this time period I also sort of got into the tech/programming &#x27;influencer&#x27; zone on various social media sites and noticed that quite a few people have so much disdain for C++ and that &#x27;Rust is better&#x27; or &#x27;C++ is Rust - -&#x27;
 I am enjoying learning C++ (so far) and so I don&#x27;t understand the hate.

I still need help with basics but where am i supposed to start i look at a question with a blank mind. Its time to put my heart and soul in these two weeks to study but im so stuck on how to do the question if im clueless of whats supposed to be in the syntax. Thank you.

                              <span>Hi,
 I hate to ask this question, but I need help. I need to learn C++ for a project that requires me to implement a function into existing code. I know I&#x27;ll need to use classes for this. While the function itself isn&#x27;t too difficult, understanding where it belongs, what inputs it needs, what it should output, and how it all fits together is the challenging part.
 I&#x27;m not an expert in programming; I&#x27;m more of a beginner. I know basic concepts like loops and data types, and I understand the idea of pointers, classes etc.. My main problem is applying these concepts correctly in different situations and internalizing them.
 I&#x27;ve been using learncpp.com, which I like, but it seems too time-intensive. Maybe I&#x27;m approaching it the wrong way? I read, make notes, and then try the examples. This takes a lot of time. I am on part three &quot;Debugging&quot; part. 
 I then switched to studyplan.dev, which offers shorter lessons. However, it sometimes feels too superficial and lacks practical exercises. Here, I also completed Chapter 3 about classes. 
 I recently discovered Codecademy&#x27;s free C++ course. Would you recommend it, or do you have other suggestions? Or should I stick with learncpp and force myself to learn it this way?
 I also saw that there are some YouTube videos, and I like the concept of watching people explain things. However, I&#x27;m not sure if there are very good series on C++.
 I would appreciate any advice you can offer.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m am looking for information on the way you handle your project&#x27;s build targets, the best practices, what worked the best for you and your teams.
 Specifically, other than debug and release targets, do you maintain other build configuration when releasing software ? Personally, I rarely only maintain those 2 targets: I have at least a RETAIL/FINAL build, and sometimes, a test build. More than 4 targets is a pain to deal with, so I never go there. Here&#x27;s the differences between them, the features they have:
 Debug build: should be for development only, not for testing. Debug version will include debug info, and no optimization;
 Release build, more specifically &#x27;development release&#x27;: does contain liited debug information (generated program database files, pdbs) but also has some degree of optimizations. The rationale of this build is that the debug build often is too big, bulky and slow to be practical when testing or reproducing a bug.
 Final/Retail : here the build has zero debug information, full optimization and for example, in visual studio, WholeProgramOptimization and link-time code generation to perform whole-program optimization. Leveraging optimizing compilers : OCs take the code that you have written and re-write parts of it in order to minimize the memory footprint, maximize execution speed, or both. Making it very hard to debug.
 Sometime, a QA build is maintained because our QA have specific needs in regards with what they need to test the software.
 What are you guys thoughts oon this ? If you also maintain a &#x27;production&#x27; build in addition to the release buid, how to did you name it ? retail ? final ?
 Thanks!

                              <span>So, I&#x27;m struggling to follow the discussion. In the May mailing there is what I can only describe as... a few very passionate view points that are all in conflict with each other. The papers all seem to refer to various bits of the contracts proposal and I feel like I&#x27;m missing some key context as to what is going on over there.
 Can someone tl;dr whats up with Contracts?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to go through this new book, and there&#x27;s a few support header files that you&#x27;re supposed to use with the code in the book. Here is a link to where they can be downloaded: https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html
 I&#x27;m using Visual Studio 2022 with C++ set to the latest version. Whenever I use them, I get a few errors from one specific part of the PPP_support.h header file. I took a screenshot of the errors. Any help would be appreciated.

 Update:
 I fixed it by adding std:: in front of string and cerr as a commenter below pointed out, but now I&#x27;m having a different issue. I can actually get the code to compile now, and the program runs. I&#x27;m still getting 4 other errors, but at least they&#x27;re not stopping me from compiling and running the program successfully. Does anyone have any idea what is causing these errors? I don&#x27;t want to run into bigger issues later because of these errors:
 Code
 Error type 1
 Error type 2

                              <span>Hello everyone. I am reviewing the textbook Accelerated C++ . It was my textbook of the OOP course. It does give me a lot of knowledge of writing OOP code in C++. 
 Chapter 11 told me to write a simplified version of STL vector called Vec . It is just something like follows. 
 /Joyounger/accelerated_cpp/chapter11/Vec.h
 I find this .h file mixes the definition and declaration. I know it is a valid code. However, may be separated into vec.h and vec.cpp better? So I tried it with CMake as follows
 cpp-learn
 I put the definition of Vec in src/vec.cpp and the declaration of Vec in include/vec.h. And I write a simple code to init a Vec class in main.cpp . However, it can not be compiled with mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build &amp;&amp; cmake .. &amp;&amp; make . The error is as follows
  /usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/cpp_learn.dir/main.cpp.o: in function &#x60;Vec::Vec()&#x27;: main.cpp:(.text._ZN3VecIiEC2Ev[_ZN3VecIiEC5Ev]+0x29): undefined reference to &#x60;Vec::create()&#x27; /usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/cpp_learn.dir/main.cpp.o: in function &#x60;Vec::~Vec()&#x27;: main.cpp:(.text._ZN3VecIiED2Ev[_ZN3VecIiED5Ev]+0x18): undefined reference to &#x60;Vec::uncreate()&#x27; collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/cpp_learn.dir/build.make:98: cpp_learn] Error 1 make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:100: CMakeFiles/cpp_learn.dir/all] Error 2 make: *** [Makefile:91: all] Error 2 
 It seems that it can not find the definition I wrote in src/vec.cpp . I also tried use g++ manually as follows
  g++ -Iinclude include/vec.h src/vec.cpp main.cpp -o tmp 
 It returned the same error. What&#x27;s the problem with my code?

                              <span>I tried to built my C++ program in Visual Studio 2022 with /MT instead of /MD to be independent from the Visual C++ Redistributable. I use OpenSSL, libz, and Boost. I have only updated Boost to the latest version because my old version didn&#x27;t include the necessary .lib files for some reason. And it works now. I expected having to rebuild the other libraries as well.
 The Internet says I shouldn&#x27;t use it with DLLs, but there are DLLs it depends on, namely libcrypto-3-x64.dll, libssl-3-x64.dll, and zlibwapi.dll.
 So, is it really working or is it just a coincidence and will break on the next computer or the next Visual Studio update?

                              <span>Imagine a function that returns a reference to something within an argument (e.g. an element within a vector). You probably don&#x27;t want to allow the user to pass in an rvalue reference for that argument because you&#x27;d be returning a dangling reference, right? What&#x27;s the proper way of preventing this rvalue references? My initial thought was to accept rvalue references but then static_assert() a failure if you see it. But, I&#x27;ve seen more projects just overload for rvalue references but leave the overload unimplemented.
 What&#x27;s more appropriate / correct?

                              <span>I think a lot of us at somepoint started questioning their art style choices and if a specific art style was was hard to learn or hard to produce for your abilities as an individual dev 
 Im kinda in that position right now because i started learning pixel art and relised that it is time consuming to make something that stands out , and i just don&#x27;t really believe i have an artistic talent 
 So what did you guys do when you were in the same spot ? What art style did you end up choosing , should i start learning 3D models instead ? And what engine i should use for these models Or maybe i should head to something like 2.5 since i dont see a lot of games adapting that style recently so maybe it could be a good choice

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I have a game, and I want to save the game state in a json file. I don&#x27;t particularly care when the file finishes being written, and I can use semaphore to put saving commands in a queue so there is no multiple file access at the same type. So... I&#x27;d just not await the task (that&#x27;s on another thread) and move on with the game.
 Is this a bad thing? Not the save game thing exactly, but the whole not awaiting a task.

                              <span>I saw Microsoft touted they made a lot of improvmenets in the latest VS2022 update. I tried the GH Copilot trial and it&#x27;s actually auto completing stuff and making good suggestions finally. Anyone else notice this?
 EDIT: For context I opened the trial a week or two ago and the Visual Studio functionality previously was awful. Now it seems to be decent.

 func1();
 func2();
 func3();
 And in EACH func_i, I have the following code
 if (a) {...}
 if (b) {...}
 if (c) {...}
 Is there a better way to organize this code to simplify the 3 if statements per function? 
 Only one of a, b or c can happen at one time. So if (a) then we will always select the a path in all functions etc

 This article explains how to run .NET C# code in Browser via WebAssembly. Several example are given - describing calling C# from JavaScript, calling JavaScript from C# and running C# Program.Main(...) method from the browser. Finally it provides an Avalonia sample showing how to run Avalonia visuals built in C# in the browser.

                              <span>tl;dr - performance problems could be memory from bad code, or thread pool starvation due to Task.Run everywhere. What else besides App Insights is useful for collecting data on an Azure app? I have seen perfview and dotnet-trace but have no experience with them
 We have a backend ASP.NET Core Web API in Azure that has about 500 instances of Task.Run, usually wrapped over synchronous methods, but sometimes wraps async methods just for kicks, I guess. This is, of course, bad (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/best-practices?view&#x3D;aspnetcore-8.0#avoid-blocking-calls)
 We&#x27;ve been having performance problems even when adding a small number of new users that use the site normally, so we scaled out and scaled up our 1vCPU / 7gb memory on Prod. This resolved it temporarily…</span>

 The output of this little test is
 True, False, True on my PC and this online compiler but False, False, True in this online compiler. I asked GPT about this and it pointed to the second results being true as well. 
 If I understood correctly, s1 creates a new string object on the heap (which is automatically registered in the intern pool) and holds the reference to that string object. i1 checks the VALUE of s1 to see if it exists in the intern pool, and since it does, i1 takes the reference from the intern pool, making s1 and i1 reference the same string object.
 Similarly, s2 creates another string object with the same value as s1 on the heap (although I&#x27;m not sure if it is immediately added to the intern pool). i2 checks the VALUE of s2 in the intern pool, finds that this string object has already been created, and thus takes the reference from the intern pool. As a result, i1 and i2 reference the same object, so they return true.
 I&#x27;d be glad if someone could explain how the intern works and why the results differ?
 PS: I&#x27;m running it in .net 7 in local and 8 in online compilers.

                              <span>I need help connecting Omniverse Isaac Sim camera outputs (frames) to a Raspberry Pi camera option in a desktop app - C# project. I attempted using a TCP socket where the client sends Isaac Sim outputs to a server running on the local IP (e.g., &#x27;127.0.0.1:8080&#x27;). I have verified the connection through a web browser by running Flask on &quot;127.0.0.1:5000/video&quot;. On the web browser, it works fine by displaying when sending a video file, but after changing the source of the frame, namely editing #VideoCapture(0) to a webcam it doesn&#x27;t work. 
 However, in my C# project, when I set the IP to 127.0.0.1 and the port to 8080, there&#x27;s a second port number. (is it optional or not?). I don&#x27;t actually have a physical Raspberry Pi camera module; there is just an option in the C# project to select a Raspberry Pi camera. Is sending frames from Isaac Sim to this option in the C# project equivalent to sending frames from a Raspberry Pi camera module to the C# project? How can I achieve this through a TCP socket to display frames on a C# desktop application? 
 Thank you for your assistance.

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I&#x27;ve been working on a pure c# FFT implementation tuned for SIMD. It seems to perform really favorably compared to other well known .NET implementations.
 I decided to open-source it under the MIT license: Aelian.FFT on GitHub
 It is also available as a NuGet package
 I realize it&#x27;s a rather niche project that will probably only appeal to folks doing DSP in .NET, but I hope this post will get it some traction, and any feedback is welcome.
 Cheers!

                              <span>Brisk is a tool for running Continuous Integration tests, think CircleCI, but much faster.
 Instead of building the test environments on each run we pre-build the environment so that your tests run as fast as possible. Combined with enough workers this gets test suite run times down to seconds (https://brisktest.com/demos).
 I&#x27;ve had a lot of requests for people who want to run Brisk in their own infrastructure and so I&#x27;ve gone ahead and open sourced it all. You can now run Brisk yourself both locally (for development/testing purposes) and in your own cloud for free.
 Currently we have dedicated support for Node JS, Ruby, Python and Go test suites and we integrate with Github Actions, CircleCI etc, Bitbucket etc. Adding additional test runners for other languages is also straightforward. 
 We also integrate with your IDE so you can access the full power of your CICD pipeline from your local machine after each save. 
 Let me know what you think.

                              <span>Hey people.
 Senior SRE here with several years of experience developing and managing k8s clusters. I&#x27;ve been studying for the CKA cert, however after thinking about it some more, CKAD is starting to make more sense to me.
 The continuous trend in k8s administration is through managed services like EKS and GKE. Rarely do I see job openings of bare metal or administrating a cluster through other means. While yes there are still cases where you need to debug the control plane, it&#x27;s extremely rare and 99% of the time, the associated cloud provider has support. 
 And yes, it&#x27;s extremely important to know how the control plane component works. But, I find that my personal experience with K8s is more in the development and application architectural side, than it is in debugging etcd or the api server.
 Does anyone else feel the same? Or is CKA still the recommended cert to get?

                              <span>I should say the demand for kubernetes is going day. Have been working in start up for around 2 years, unfortunately still doesn&#x27;t use kubernetes actively. How should I develop my skills particularly in kubernetes and helm. Is completing a course from platforms like KodeKloud validates my skill on social media? I genuinely feel I&#x27;m stuck at my current company and wanna switch for more exposure. But this job market..... Aghhhh.... is not the only problem. The technical interviews, somehow, are always under the belt. 
 Any advice? Please share your experience for starting as freshers in the field of DevOps.

                              <span>Probably not in a traditional sense but who knows. Perhaps they do have QA practices and SDLC practices, PRs and the like.
 I imagine it’s not just individual contributors writing software solo for their own purposes but maybe it is. Thoughts?

 Like, is it possible to just create a new character from nowhere and use it or would that crash the ”platform”?

                              <span>I have about 7 years of experience as a software engineer. But what&#x27;s interesting about my resume is that I have exclusively worked for Cybersecurity/Software Security companies in the past (some big names in the industry) but worked there exclusively as a software engineer. The thing is, I&#x27;ve been exposed to security stuff more than the average software engineer, but in no way am I a security engineer or an expert in anything security. So I&#x27;ve been casually applying to new jobs just to test the waters and see what&#x27;s out there, and I&#x27;ve set my LinkedIn to &quot;open to work&quot; (hidden, of course), and I&#x27;m surprised by the number of companies wanting to interview me... as a software security engineer. I am NOT qualified for any of those roles and have not used any of the tools listed, but they still want to chat. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve applied to a number of pure SWE roles and nothing but rejections. If you&#x27;re a software engineer with a cybersecurity background, the market&#x27;s probably hot for you. Just my observations.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a software engineer at a relatively small fintech, and we&#x27;ve been trying to hire a Principal engineer to help us with some of our funkier apps as well as general tech vision. I&#x27;ve run quite a number of coding interviews over the past couple of weeks. It&#x27;s a pretty simple problem, requiring basic knowledge of how to use a dictionary/hashmap, with a few different steps along the way that build on one another. We offer it in your choice of any major language, but 99% of candidates pick Python. The test is completely open book and the interviewers provide coaching as well. 
 My issue is that over the past couple of weeks, we&#x27;ve interviewed THREE different developers from Capital One, all Senior+ level, and all of them have very clearly had absolutely ZERO coding exposure. In 45 minutes, none of them could fulfill a single unit test, such as throwing an error if a parameter was None, or throwing an error if a value wasn&#x27;t in the dictionary. All of them were performing below what I would expect from a first year CS student, yet 2 claimed to have Masters in CS. 
 What the hell is going on? Is Capital One some kind of complete joke organization? Surely not, right? Are these people lying about working there? If so, why did all three have Capital One as their current employer? Is there some kind of conspiracy? Anyone else experienced this?

                              <span>I’m 27 and got my masters in 2019 and after about 8 months of being in office before Covid began, I’ve since primarily been working from home for over 4 years and find it so depressing. I live alone and apart from the occasional day in the office I spend almost all my time alone staring at a computer screen working on something that I ultimately feel is pointless. Sometimes I’ll go into the office even when no one else is in just to get out of the house, which is definitely better but still very lonely. I just want to do something real and physical, I feel so sad and stressed all the time and I keep getting sick. 
 I don’t think it’s the job itself because I’ve worked for 3 different companies in the past 5 years, all with very nice people, but just hate the software developer lifestyle. I truly only came into this profession for the money and now I think I’m ready to leave.

                              <span>I have 2 years experience at a fortune 500 company in the south and just recently landed a new job in the public sector. I&#x27;m completely surprise by just how much of a gap the tech stacks are. I was always told that the private sector is efficient, leaner, and decades advance. Man I could not be more wrong. My old job did not use git (internal decades old version control that was a nightmare using between just two people), the senior developers insisted on using notepad ++ (complain whenever they saw me using vs code), and I just started learning React and Spring boot (seniors insisted in vanilla JS and in house low code backend language). My mind is blown. Whenever I ask this multi billion dollar company why, the responses I always got was that &quot;new&quot; tech is for over hype FAANG companies not &quot;real&quot; companies that make products. 
 I had so many issues with how navigating the ancient tech stacks with no documentation that made me feel like an idiot. We would spend months building an application from scratch and custom developing everything and I got so many complaints whenever I pointed out a limitation that our products were doing that was solve decades ago with new stacks. I was told that if I ever went anywhere else they be even more behind and there no point learning these skills. My Team didn&#x27;t even code. They were all engineers with decades of outdated experience that they even admitted are so behind they could not work with modern stacks and just waiting for retirement. I was the only engineer under 40 on my team and could not aks anyone for help because they didn&#x27;t even understand html. Honestly I&#x27;m at a loss for words right now.

                              <span>Currently interviewing for a new position, and they told me the salary range upfront.
 Assuming I get the offer, and they don’t offer me 95k-100k-ish, do I always negotiate until I hit their upper range? I’m less than 1yr out of college and didn’t negotiate anything for my current position, and also didn’t know the salary range so I’m unsure the best way to ensure I get the most amount of salary out of this position.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;ve been learning Rust for the last couple of years and it&#x27;s mostly been a great experience - by far the best programming language I&#x27;ve used.
 But I have to wonder - why on earth does Rust have multiple different data types for strings? Is there any objective reason for this?
 I honestly think it would be easier to simply have one type - String - and get rid of the str type. We could then have string slices as just borrows of the String type (&amp;String).
 Is there any objective reason for having multiple string types in Rust? It seems to just lead to having to write lots of .to_owned()s, String::from()s and .as_str()s, as well as defining my function signatures as this:
 rust fn funcname&gt;(string_param: S) 
 Instead of just this:
 rust fn funcname(string_param: String) 
 I thought it would be interesting to discuss the positives and negatives of having many string types in Rust, as for me I honestly don&#x27;t see the positives!
 Any information is appreciated, Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been coding c++ for about 5+ yrs now, that&#x27;s how I get most of the work done, plus some python, shell, JS and what not. I started going through the rust book and then the rustlings exercises, which seem quite easy and the behavior of language constructs is very intuitive so far.
 Things I&#x27;ve liked so far:
  
A+ documentation, amazing really. 
 Delivery: I have all the documentation (book + reference + RustByExample) on local storage, so just spin up a python server and its there on any browser on my local network. Having to run this server b/c I have a flatpack mozilla which keeps copying index.html to a temp directory and breaks the experience.
 Content: Again, I&#x27;m impressed by the thought put into the documentation, I&#x27;ll lean more towards RustByExample compared to the Book as it get…</span>

                              <span>One day after many years of telling people I&#x27;ve never had real issues with arch it nuked my setup(removed kernel during update and refused to mount the image(skill issue I acknowledge)). Regardless of the reason, I realized I had to be able to get this brick up and running quickly(now and in the future) or people would yell at me. So I went with the least of evils I could find, the arch installer. However, after employing this tool I&#x27;ve ecountered some oddities(it works, but some config properties did not persist an update(e.g. keyboard layout for LUKS)) would this be the place to share, or are you only interessted in systems that have gone through the trials of the wiki?

                              <span>I just bought a new GPU from AMD, and since i had Nvidia til now, i can&#x27;t log into Gnome, i need to purge the i think kernel modules and all that.
 Do i also need to install something for the new GPU to work? Or is there some other process.
 Cause right now, it goes up to GDM, but logging in just brings me back to GDM. Do i just reverse steps what i did to install the driver and that&#x27;s enough, or do i need something else?
 I can reinstall Arch if need be, it&#x27;s fine, but i don&#x27;t think i have to, just not sure what to do exactly.

                              <span>Hello - new to this subreddit, as I am new to Arch. Long time Linux user here. I started off with Mandrake way back in the day and have hopped distros very little. When Ubuntu came out, I jumped on it and ran with it for many many years. I slowly became disenchanted with the direction of development and the decisions being made, so I switched to Mint LMDE last year. Of course I heard of Arch, but had never tried it. This weekend I loaded Arch up into a KVM/Qemu VM and was blown away on how freaking fast and customizable it was with only the pittance of resources I gave the VM. Long story short, Arch is now the host.

                              <span>I have a random value between 0 and 1 called rand, an exponential called prob_exp and something that must happen if rand 0, if b 1.
 Is it better to leave 1 if and a mandatory exponential operation, or adding one if, like in the following:
  if (b0 there is an additional if.
 I know I can easily just test it out, however I wonder if someone has even the insight on what theorically is better.
 The if statement on b is nor likely nor unlikely. The if statement on the rand ranges from cases where it&#x27;s nor likely nor unlikely, to cases where it&#x27;s unlikely. This latter info can change a bit what you might suggest

 I wrote a prime number generator in C that uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes. It comes with a bitmap library that I also wrote from scratch. I&#x27;m looking for some recommendations/fixes/improvements that I could add to my code. Can be anything from code quality/clarity to error handling (which I&#x27;m especially not confident about). I&#x27;m also trying to make my program as fast as possible. It can currently generate the first 1 million primes in about 0.1s. Might look into multithreading or maybe SIMD if it can help make it faster, but I&#x27;m really not familiar with either so any advice is welcome!
 I&#x27;ll be updating my code along as I get feedback!

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently writing some multi-threaded code with a client-server model-- initial thread is the server, which spawns client threads, and all interthread communication is done through the server. All threads share some global variables which are primarily used for signaling, the simplest example being a boolean flag which signals a global shutdown. Only one thread (the server) will ever write to this flag, and once set it remains set until all threads return, but many threads will read it many times in a hot loop before this happens, so I&#x27;d like to optimize those reads as much as possible.
 I&#x27;m fairly new to multi-threaded programming, but from what I&#x27;ve read, data races are primarily caused by one thread reading after the write has begun but before the write has finished, causing partially written data to be read. However, in this case it is a single byte being written, only one thread is the writer, only the transition from 0 to 1 needs to be detected, and that detection doesn&#x27;t need to be perfectly synchronized between threads because the value will stay the same until all threads have reacted to it.
 I can&#x27;t see a way that anything bad will happen if I just use a non-atomic bool, but again, I&#x27;m new to this and I don&#x27;t want to introduce a subtle bug that might bite me suddenly down the line; every relevant search result I&#x27;ve found says to always use atomic operations by default, but they&#x27;re using more complex data types. I can&#x27;t imagine how a bool can ever be in a partially updated state so I feel fairly safe using a non-atomic bool, but is there something I&#x27;m missing? And if a non-atomic bool is safe, at what point does a non-atomic one-writer many-readers variable become unsafe? I imagine that depends on architecture (data bus size, etc.), so should I just assume anything larger than a bool requires atomic accesses only?

                              <span>Hi, this is my first time using C. To learn C I decided to build an image to ascii art converter. I want to convert the image to grayscale and then map the brightness/luminosity of each pixel to a character in a character map.
 This is what it looks like: https://imgur.com/a/F9Vbwtd
 What am I doing wrong?
 Code: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;c #include  #include 
 int main(int argc, char **argv) { VipsImage *in; VipsImage *out; if (VIPS_INIT(argv[0])) vips_error_exit(NULL); if (argc !&#x3D; 3) vips_error_exit(&quot;usage: %s infile outfile&quot;, argv[0]); if (!(in &#x3D; vips_image_new_from_file(argv[1], NULL))) vips_error_exit(NULL); if (vips_scRGB2BW(in, &amp;out, NULL)) vips_error_exit(NULL); g_object_unref(in); if (vips_image_write_to_file(out, argv[2], NULL)) vips_error_exit(NULL); g_object_unref(out); return 0; } 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Edit: using vips_colourspace(in, &amp;out, VIPS_INTERPRETATION_B_W, NULL) gets my desired result. But what&#x27;s the difference between that and vips_scRGB2BW(in, &amp;out, NULL)?

                              <span>Notice how C and C++ aren&#x27;t even from the same country, yet they can do all of the same things? Regardless of their origins, because C++ was built on C, you need to write libraries in C to support the functions of C++, if you don&#x27;t have the standard libraries already. Even then, some older systems with separate I/Ospace don&#x27;t let you too easily write interactive (or reactive) programs for them in C; luckily you can include assembly files for them to fit your hardware.
 One key difference in C functions from their C++ counterparts is how C++ replaces the target object of a function with a pointer named &quot;this&quot;. That&#x27;s its actual name; the indefinite demonstrative pronoun fits for being the object of which the function is a member in C++.
 Templates aren&#x27;t exclusive to C++ either; in C you can imitate them with macros, that while they may destroy type safety, can still be used for dynamic dimensionality or objects whose size is dependent on a parameter. These are, of course, object-like macros. Sadly, most folks tend to forego both object-like and function-like macros and only define simple values or even just dummies whose only purpose is to satisfy preprocessor conditions and compile code within. In fact, using object-like and function-like macros in C, I do recommend the practice of adding types as arguments for as many different types are in your functions. You can actually do that as it&#x27;s only ever the preprocessor that sees them.
 C can do encapsulation too, but requires objects to be in separate files included by a &quot;root&quot; file for it, whereas C++ has classes. Members in branch files are &quot;private&quot; if instantiated and &quot;protected&quot; if static. Members in the root file are &quot;public&quot;. Trouble is that even C++ hasn&#x27;t a type of class whose members are &quot;protected&quot; by default.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been delving deep into the intricate behavior of pointer arithmetic in C, specifically when it intersects with the issue of integer overflow
 #include 
 #include 
 int main() {
 int arr[5] &#x3D; {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
 int *ptr &#x3D; arr;
 ptr +&#x3D; INT_MAX; // This line is the crux of the issue
 printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, *ptr);
 return 0;
 }
 increment a pointer by INT_MAX, a value that far exceeds the bounds of the allocated array. According to the C standard, this results in undefined behavior. However, the exact implications of this are rather nebulous and dependent on several factors, including the underlying hardware and the compiler optimizations.
 so my question is How do different compilers (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC) handle such extreme pointer arithmetic? Are there specific flags or settings that can mitigate the undefined behavior in such cases?
 and How does the C standard address integer overflow in pointer arithmetic, and what are the recommended ways to detect and handle potential overflows?

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I have the following Makefile:
 main: mylib.o libmyshared.so gcc -o main mylib.o main.c mylib.o: mylib.c gcc -c mylib.c libmyshared.so: myshared.c gcc -fPIC -shared -o libmyshared.so myshared.c 
 In my main.c file, I use the dlopen suite of functions to dynamically load symbols from libmyshared.so. I do this to implement &quot;hot reload&quot; for those set of functions. It did not work at first, because myshared.c referenced functions from mylib.c, and it obviously does not have the location of those symbols when it gets hotloaded (myshared.c was not a shared object at first. It was just a standardly linked object, linked in the main step).
 As an experiment, I modified the above to be the following:
 main: mylib.o libmyshared.so gcc -o main mylib.o main.c # Made the code position idependent mylib.o: mylib.c gcc -fPIC -c mylib.c # ADDED mylib.o as dependency libmyshared.so: mylib.o myshared.c gcc -fPIC -shared -o mylib.o libmyshared.so myshared.c 
 I was surprised to see that the program &quot;worked&quot; properly (though it may only be working &quot;by accident&quot;). My thought was that both main and the libmyshared.so binary would have their own in-memory copy of mylib.o and the program wouldn&#x27;t work properly. That said, all of the memory is owned by the main.c code, so mylib.c and libmyshared.so does not have any state of its own.
 My questions are: 1. In this configuration, are there two copies of mylib.o at runtime (e.g. one owned by main and the other owned by libmyshared.so)? I guess the symbols are just compiled into the binary, so there is just duplicate code. 2. Would making mylib.o into a shared object remedy that problem (i.e. make it only use one copy)?

                              <span>To clarify, I did do homework, but that&#x27;s pretty much all the mental exercise I got in regards to subject matter, most of the time I just absorbed the concept as the teacher was teaching it, so it wasn&#x27;t really all that hard to execute it when the time came
 So not sure if it still exists, but it was through a program at Rutgers where I took classes at NJIT, so I guess it&#x27;s technically NJIT? But basically I was a lazy student and pretty much just chose Comp Sci since I thought it was one of the majors people took, when they didn&#x27;t care, so I pretty much just graduated with a Comp Sci degree having never studied, and didn&#x27;t learn until later that Comp Sci is actually considered one of the harder majors. GPA wasn&#x27;t spectacular or anything, somewhere in the 3.0-3.5 range IIRC. I&#x27;m curious if this is the standard situation or if mine was unique

                              <span>I got lucky in that my schools focus on compsci is very low and I took AP compsci principles (there were literally five kids in it) I was the only one who had significant prior experience therefore the teacher who is also the tech department leader took interest and offered me a internship this summer. It will probably mostly just be mundane IT tasks and I won&#x27;t be paid (most likely) but I&#x27;m still happy about it and just wanted to share, thanks.

                              <span>So many technologies all at once, the part of the project I was hired for and am more prepared for is scrapped, my main contact is in meetings all day, my 1 on 1 is just kind of around but mostly doing his own work all day.
 Anyway, I managed to get some stuff installed and I almost have access to everything. Missed 6 objectives today though. Idk, place is chill and everyone seems happy with me though. But I’ve done nothing productive despite trying so hard to figure out what to do from everyone.
 Anyway, I’m grateful for the experience, but this is kinda stressful with how I have no idea what’s going on
 Thought I’d share idk

                              <span>I decided to make the switch from MX Linux to Debian 12 only to realize that there are no drivers available for my network card
 I proceeded with the following method which did not yield any results as the wifi did get enabled but no networks are visible 
 https://easylinuxtipsproject.blogspot.com/p/realtek.html?m&#x3D;1#ID9
 Then continued with https://github.com/HRex39/rtl8852be.git which gave me some errors upon using make so I decided to skip it in favor of maybe working with the kernel
 So from what I see the Linux kernel 6.2 has my drivers supported but debian 12 is on 6.1
 So I have a question:
 If it&#x27;s viable to update my kernel either using the original version or liqourix/xanmod/zen and if that would fix my driver issues (I know debian is against going with the newest kernels but what am I to do) if so what kernel should I use?
 And a request:
 How could I undo what I did with the first driver method
 If it&#x27;s of any help MX Linux worked out of the box with my network card with AHS(which apparently uses liqourix) and Kali Linux bare metal also worked(which from what I know uses a proprietary kernel)
 I&#x27;m going on a work shift so I won&#x27;t be able to answer messages but I&#x27;ll respond as soon as possible and I&#x27;m grateful for any answers, thank you in advance.

                              <span>I just updated my ThinkPad Trixie installation and mid update it stopped saying libscrypto.so.3 wasn&#x27;t installed. I&#x27;ve an encrypted home partition btw. Last time this machine was updated was about 4 months ago. I&#x27;ve used Debian for 20 years btw. I tried installing it from command line but couldn&#x27;t ... The command line just kept reporting it&#x27;s missing. I knew a restart was hopeless, and of course it was. 
 So, I&#x27;ll throw it out there: bite the bullet and reinstall from scratch or maybe cp a pretty much identical system over using sysrescue or.... ? 
 Btw, recovery mode doesn&#x27;t boot either.
 My first #splat# with Debian in a decade. My other Trixie ThinkPad also with encrypted home is fine, but I updated weekly. 
 Any hints and tips appreciated.

                              <span>When I using JPA I don&#x27;t use relations on entities. Specially @OneToMany collections. At my previous job they used abusively that single entity fetch selects mapped entity collections and each of them mapped other entities and so on. Persitsting or deleting mapped entities also makes confusions on cascade options. It feels much cleaner for me to persist or delete without mappings. When I&#x27;m querying I just use join statemen. I use @OneToOne on some cases for easy access. Is there anyone like me.

                              <span>Azurite is an open source emulator of Azure Storage API. Wrote an article demonstrating how it can be used with Testcontainers to test Azure Blob interactions in Spring Boot. 
 In the AWS world, LocalStack is widely used to emulate services like S3, DynamoDB etc. I think it&#x27;s pretty cool that an emulator exists for writing integration tests involving Azure blob storage as well.

 Vtuber style logo master SAWARATSUKI has made icons for Arch Linux and Ubuntu but there is nothing yet for Linux Mint so I decided to make one myself. Please tell your feedback about what I can improve.

                              <span>It seems more and more people are considering Linux, in light of all the nonsense elsewhere. It seems a good time, too: Nvidia should finally start working decently well, features like HDR are getting real development, and proton support for games seems to work for almost everything that doesn&#x27;t involve an invasive anticheat system. For average home users, Linux, collectively, seems to have reached a point where it has everything they need... but when I come to try to recommend a distro to these potential new users, instead of having one or two just solid, uncontroversial options I can hand them and be the end of it, I end up with a long list of &quot;maybe this one, unless...&quot;

 This has been bugging me for a LONG time!
 The 80186 PUSH immediate byte instruction wasn&#x27;t sign extending the immediate before pushing to the stack. Such a simple bug causing such a big problem.
 Star Trek: 25th Anniversary always crashed after the Interplay logo. Now it&#x27;s good. Gonna try a play through tonight, great game. One of my favs as a kid!

                              <span>I work on a team that builds distributed systems, mostly message driven micro-services with some React UIs. 
 My coworkers are experienced (10+ years) but mostly in Java and Web. 
 I’m the only developer who has knowledge on infrastructure components (Kubernetes, Linux Config, SSL certs, Ansible, etc)
 I have mentioned to my manager that we should have a backup. However when those tasks get assigned to my coworkers they struggle and it eventually come to me.
 Part of the problem is that my coworkers lack basic knowledge (ex: Linux) so given them a task to develop an automation playbook will likely not go well.
 Any advice? I have already created extensive documentation that walks the through existing processes. I had 0 docs when I joined and just read the source &amp; config files.

                              <span>I have a tech lead who seems to be unabashedly anti-DRY. I&#x27;m of the mind that if you have 2 variables or sets of data that should ALWAYS be the same, that you SHOULD (assuming some huge hurdle) that you should have a source of truth that feeds both or one passes it to the other.
 For example, if you click a button (&quot;foo&quot;) and need to call a method (&quot;bar&quot;) that passes that button&#x27;s value to somewhere else, you should change the code so &quot;foo&quot; is in a variable somewhere and passed to &quot;bar&quot; as opposed to hard coding &quot;foo&quot; inside &quot;bar&quot;
 But this can obviously end up with writing more code so that the foo variable is getting passed around.
 So this tech lead seems to be of the mindset that you should always change the least amount of code possible regardless of anything else. I mean I get this perspective, but it seems insanely short sighted.
 Am I the crazy one here? I feel like doing so is going against everything I&#x27;ve been taught and what the community says.

                              <span>We work in a fintech company, in charge of a rather critical system. There&#x27;s currently no on-call for anyone on the team.
 The team lead has been kind of open about wanting to do on-call and has set a team meeting about it for sunday morning. I&#x27;ll be very surprised if it&#x27;s not going to be about that.
 Strictly speaking - this is a huge downgrade to the WLB at work, even if statistically nothing happens at weekends that will require me to work, even just the mentality that I can be called during the weekend is just not okay for me. I am not okay with this, and I&#x27;m probably going to voice my opinion on it. If I&#x27;m not mistaken it&#x27;s downright illegal to just suddenly make the work conditions worse like this.
 So having said that...has anyone had to fight against this kind of thing? how did you do it without butting heads too much? did you do it but get compensated somehow for it?

Earlier I was pretty much give me a problem and off we go kinda guy. I do know this is normal. But then, why do I get so paranoid when I am spending time thinking I am not productive? If I go to sleep a day without pushing any code, why does it give such a sinking feeling of not doing anything productive? I am well respected in the team (I think, lol) in my current role and had good career trajectory so far. I tried to &quot;just be okay&quot;, its not really working. Any advice?

I don&#x27;t need any html view components as that will be taken care of by a separate front-end component.
 I have worked on rails before and for those who can relate, I&#x27;m looking for something like devise.

 Project layout context:
 We have grpc backend that does database crud operations following MVC-REPO. This is traditionally for front-end apps, but brief overview of the pattern as follows:
 M (Model) - represents the data, a struct
 Repo (Repository) - abstraction layer between the model and controller that does the database operations for the given model.
 C (Controller) - handles the input, grpc requests in this case, interacts with the repository for the db operations and returns back the response.
 V (View) - omitted, but would take the response from the controller and send it back to the client that invoked the grpc request.

                              <span>Obviously using comments is important. I use them constantly as I forget pretty much everything if I don’t. I am pretty new to coding, and have been doing two courses these last two or three months and am now doing projecta from Big Book Small Python Projects. I am having a LOT of fun, and learning a lot I didn’t know I could do. 
 Anyways, I am struggling with shite memory sometimes and just wanted some input on what level of ”forgetfulness” is ”normal” and if you feel it has improved with practice. 
 When I write a project that is a bit longer (for me that is maybe 200+ lines) I always make extensive docstrings, doctests/examples of use and write comments next to most expressions. I might be doing this too much, but if I don’t I just forget how the expression or loop or whatever works. 
 I often look at something the next day and think (why the hell does it say (x + y + 1) here? Is it the index position or why did I need that +1 again. Or for example, ”what data type was this variable now”? (Well maybe not the last one but it is just an example) If I am working on something during friday I will keep working one or two hours during the weekend too or come monday I am so out of the mindset I just have to basically relearn my code.
 I am not really looking for a guide on when and how to comment your code, I could google that (but it is still welcome if anyone feels like sharing their process) but more input on what level of forgeting the project and how the code works is normal, and how you have developed this ability over time or if you rely almost entirely on comments. 
 What do you think about this? 
 Edit: the use of x + y is just an example. Don’t worry, I am not actually naming variables stuff like x or y.

                              <span>Been studying programming on and off in my spare time for a few years now. I&#x27;m in my early 30s. Never really progressed past tutorial hell and courses. Couldn&#x27;t begin anything for my CS50P final project because I was aiming too complex and just becoming discouraged. 
 Wrote a Python program for my job -- nothing too crazy, formats things that I use every day according to the formatting required for a bunch of security controls, and man, when I was testing and the output was coming out perfect I finally understand why this is so addictive. I thought I was too dumb to do anything; started too late, blah blah blah. The satisfication I feel from 200 lines of WET code that I can now reformat into something polished is awesome.
 Now I&#x27;m looking forward to submitting my final project and moving onto another language (probably via CS50x) to continue learning. I&#x27;m just stoked that I finally wrote something myself from scratch and wanted to share :)

                              <span>At my previous job every DEV had their own dev environment which mimic&#x27;d our entire architecture. This feels prohibitively expensive to me, I am wondering how this would compare to an architecture where there was a shared environment with traffic and data isolation; so that my dev traffic didn&#x27;t touch my colleagues dev traffic (if I choose for this to be the case).

                              <span>We were aiming to renew out CI/CD platform license when we got hit with the new May 1st prices https://octopus.com/pricing/overview . Our env is not even that massive, we have about 100 endpoints and a couple dozen projects. It went from a couple thousand dollars for a perpetual license a few years back to now 20-30k with a not much bigger installation. Is there anyone else here with my on the same boat? what have been your options and what are your take aways so far? 
 We have spent years building our projects in Octopus and it will be a pain to uproot but we are measuring up out costs vs time. Azure DevOps no longer feels like a bad move but wondering if there are free options that could compare. I am aware of https://www.fdeploy.com/ project which is a bit of middle finger to Octopus for what they did but I have very low hopes in that ever being a thing, its not even ready to play test.

                              <span>Disclaimer: not a Red-Hat employee nor an OCI foundation member.
 TL;DR: Skopeo is great for Air-Gapped Container Registry syncs and image management.
 I am currently working in the Industrial IoT sector where a lot of Cloud-Native products are seeping in. The only issue is customers of Operations Technology despise Internet Connectivity. Without Internet Connectivity, working with Cloud-Native technologies like Containers is a massive pain.
 So as a common way to solve such a problem I was working with Ansible to setup systems with a Docker Registry and then using container tarballs to do the following:
  
docker pull images from registries
 docker save to create tarballs
 docker load to extract them on the main gateway
 docker tag to make sure I rename it for making it compliant with the registry
 docker push to registry
 cleanup etc.
  
This works well for a single architecture system e.g. amd64. Now I have devices which also are arm64 based and the registry isn&#x27;t smart enough to generate manifests to let devices determine which blobs to pull based on the underlying architecture.
 I tried Skopeo today and in the lab I was able to sync an Image from Docker Hub to a testing registry in 10s.. No docker gymnastics involved.
 If i need to create tarballs - Skopeo can do that. If I need to push tarballs to a registry it can do that too. Cherry on Top, no need to have docker installed on your local machine where some development is needed.
 I will combine Ansible and Skopeo to get a large leap on the product I am working on.
 The only thing I need to figure out is to generate a Manifest List for multi-arch container images available on Docker Hub
 Amazing tool, would recommend for air-gapped scenarios.

 tech stack is aws, ecs, lambdas, some eks(migrating).
 ci/cd is jenkins.
 we have a one in a time chance to refresh the stack, 
 The big elephant in the room is still using jenkins.
 We are accostumed to it, but some of the comments we got were that new CI systems are easier to maintain in scale over EKS.
 consider that we may use backstage for the UI and develop all of the missing support ourselves....what CI would you use? github actions, tekton? Maybe something else?

                              <span>My company is choosing OTel as the telemetry framework we are going to adopt. I&#x27;ve been reading about the Otel SDK and Grafana Alloy, and a bit about Prometheus and Loki and I&#x27;m trying to understand how these elements reasonably work without any practical experience with them and would appreciate any feedback you have.
 Application w/ SDK --- Collector --- Data backend &#x3D; This seems to be the recommended components.
 Application w/ SDK - Can push to Collector which will transform the data to export to the data backend.
 The recommended configuration for an Application w/ SDK is to host an agent, which is basically a Collector, on the same host as the application, to handle transmitting OTel to the Collector. 
 Q. How bad is it really to run the Application without the agent, and just push with the SDK?
 Q: Is the push model much worse than the pull model? At what level of scale does pull make more sense?
 Q. Does it make sense to mix and match pull metrics, and push traces and logs? The service discovery for pull seems like just another thing to deal with.
 Collector - Can be configured to pull metrics , can it pull logs and traces too?
 Q. Is it as simple as putting a load balancer in front of Collectors, and just have everything blast things to Collectors?
 I would really appreciate any answers to this. Thank you

                              <span>I have two functions. Function A generates data and saves it in a new line in a file. This function runs for a long time and generates multiple datasets. Function B performs a calculation on the dataset (one line), which takes longer than the data generation process.
 Currently, Function A saves the data, and I calculate the results by reading each line from the file and save them in a different file. However, this method is not efficient in terms of multithreading and retains all previously solved datasets in the original file, which will grow to a few hundred GB.
 I am considering using a database where Function A writes the data and Function B appends the solutions. I am unsure if there are better approaches to optimize this process.
 The challenging part is that I need to perform these tasks in parallel and run Function A about 20 times with different arguments. The execution time of Function A varies, so I aim to utilize all CPU cores for different solving functions once Function A completes. 
 I am not sure what the best approach is. 
 Additionally, I need to initiate everything with SRLUM, but this shouldnt be a problem, I hope.

                              <span>Numberphile&#x27;s latest video with James Grime looked at Pollock&#x27;s conjecture that every positive whole number is the sum of at most five tetrahedral numbers. They think that 343867 is the last (&#x3D;biggest) number to require five terms, it should be at most four after that. The conjecture nor the suspicion have been proven, yet.
 I made a multi-threaded C program for Mac and Linux that analyses any given number from 1 to 232 -1. It is not specifically geared towards disproving (or confirming) the conjecture; it only looks at the single given number and calculates all its tetrahedral sums of up to five terms.
 For example: tetrasum -q 12345678 completes in about 2.3 s on an 11 year old Mac. On a Raspberry Pi 5 with 4 cores at 2.4 GHz, it took a little under 3 hours for my program to calculate that there are 863 tetrahedral sums of up to four terms for the number 232 -1, and another 377968 sums of five terms.
 Compilation command that worked for me is specified in the comments: gcc -std&#x3D;gnu17 -Ofast -march&#x3D;native -Wall -Wextra -o tetrasum tetrasum.c -lm -lpthread on Linux.
 Just having some fun. Let me know how to improve it!

 My team at work is moving towards using UML for formal design documents. We&#x27;re looking at training to get everyone on the same page. A good bit (not all, but likely a majority) of our software is written in C. I know that most, if not all, of UML can be used to design software written in C but UML training typically has an OO bias. 
 Is there good training to learn UML which includes how to use it outside of an object oriented paradigm?
 Edit: our C code is not especially OO, nor is there any plan to change in that direction. My question is about training to use UML for how we currently write software, not how to write C to match UML.

 and according to their docs there are 2 types of messages queued and non queued
 while i do understand how the queued messages are dispatched to the window procedure,
 i&#x27;m very confused at how the system can randomly call my window procedure with a non queued messages, is it called from a different thread ? could there possibly be data races involved since the procedure modifies the window data.

                              <span>[Design related question]
 I am creating a shell program which has 2 functions with mostly similar code, little part of code is different based on the argv count. I want to reuse the code as much as possible. 1 approach would be to create different function for common parts and different function for different parts and call them both from a single function. But the code is already pretty modular and this solution will make it ugly.
 what other options do I have? I was thinking function pointers but the number of arguments are different
 void function() {
 /* common parts of code in both func1 &amp; func2 */
 /* different parts of code in both func1 &amp; func2 */
 /* common parts of code in both func1 &amp; func2 */
 }
 Thank you

                              <span>In my attempt to make the program, I always run into includePath errors in my VS Code. I can only import standard libraries like stdio.h, stdlib.h and such header files only. In case I try to import a custom header file, say gtk-3.0, I run into includePath errors. Even for files that were installed with msys2 like openssl. I need your help to learn more and fix this issue. So that despite using any header file (in-built or external) without running into includePath error squiggles in VS Code forever.
 Here is what I have done:
 I am trying to build a simple project with gtk-3.0 which validates phone numbers. My setup is Windows 11 with Visual Studio Code. I have installed C development environment using MSYS2 from here: https://www.msys2.org. After installing MSYS2, I ran the following com…</span>

 That&#x27;s what my son said. I was just simply playing around TileMap and pathfinding. Somehow prototype developed and I created this. You are the horse that wants to return home, to do this you need to solve the main task by transferring goods between workshops. What do you think should I abandon it or is there any potential in it?

                              <span>I have finished my game that is on the steam store, but have been pushing back the release date for months. I can&#x27;t continue with coding my new game until I deal with this mental hurdle !
 Viewing some posts in this sub I understand people are frustrated with how much &quot;low effort&quot; stuff is on the steam store. My tower defense game doesn&#x27;t have any new never before seen mechanics. I know not every game is going to have that. It just leaves me with a feeling of &quot;would anyone pay for this?&quot;. Is this a normal feeling that devs have? doubting your work? feels like I am charging money for something that isn&#x27;t perfect or ground breaking? 
 I have about 130 wish lists, I am thinking of releasing at $3.99. I just don&#x27;t want to release for free because it seems like steam doesn&#x27;t push free games at all ( 30% of $0 is $0 ).
 Does my game look worthy of being on steam or should I just try another game? Trailer was made by fiver.

                              <span>One of the problems I have is not that I am not artistic, it&#x27;s that it is not my strong point, I am a programmer, and I would rather use art assets and commissioned work to get my project done, especially since I have some really good quality sources. AI is definitely not something I want to look to, I enjoy buying and hiring artists, and many of them I maintain relationships with and they do custom alterations and give other guidance and feedback for my game for free from time to time.
 However, one of my fears is that someone plays my game, notices assets or tilesets from a particular artist, and suddenly my game looks cheap and lazy, when in reality I have been putting all my heart into it.
 Am I overthinking? Do people really care if they notice some of the scenery on the maps come from asset packs?

                              <span>By &quot;social media power&quot;, I mean a large following on platforms like youtube and twitter. Or at least the attention of people with large platforms.
 Without that, you&#x27;re a nobody just screaming into the void. And like I said, you&#x27;d be doing gamedev on nightmare difficulty.
 Social media is at the very core of indie game marketing. If you don&#x27;t have social media power, your attempts to market your game are mostly futile.
 &quot;Social media power&quot; can conceal shortcomings in the game. Or hype up an average game into something really special. 
 Ultimately, it&#x27;s your game that needs to speak for itself. But with &quot;social media power&quot;, you can reach more people and give game more chances to speak, which in turn would translate to more sales.

                              <span>Hi,
 Last month I released my first indie game, and it only had 2000 wishlists, a number very far from the minimum of 7500 recommended to get the launch boost, but it has performed better than I though selling almost 2200 copies during the first month, mainly because it was covered by youtubers and streamers with millions of suscribers during the firsts weeks.
 And I have made a video talking about how I experienced the launch from my point of view and how each of the videos and streams had an impact on the sales: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Y1YRN7RqOwI&amp;pp&#x3D;ygUHYWRyaWJlaA%3D%3D

                              <span>If you are a solo dev, what&#x27;s the reason you don&#x27;t want to add manpower to your project(s)?
 How can you possibly manage to do everything in game development yourself without compromise a few things? Is it expected to be good at everything? 
 To hire contractors or outsourcing e.g. voice acting, testing or marketing, then you&#x27;re still a solo dev, right? Is there a limit on how much you can outsource to still be a solo dev?

It&#x27;s a tough listen because the host often seems condescending and dismissive of others&#x27; opinions. I get this vibe from many podcasters, and it&#x27;s really frustrating.

                              <span>I am working on a game that has turn based combat and currently I hide the mouse from players when it is not their turn. The thinking is that they can&#x27;t take any actions so the mouse is a distraction. Removing the mouse also helps them to understand it&#x27;s not their turn and they can&#x27;t do anything.
 I&#x27;ve had some mixed feedback from play testers.
 I haven&#x27;t had much luck finding anything relating to mouse behavior best practices. Any suggested reading or known best practices for hiding/showing the mouse to PC players?

 Been working on a personal project and this program is among other things designed to either take a vector or a pair of vectors and send them to subroutines that pick an element at random from it or them then give back that element and the remaining vector or vectors with that element removed. My code doesn&#x27;t appear to do that last part correctly as changes made to the vector within the subroutine don&#x27;t seem to persist.

                              <span>Hi !
 Today I was messing around with std::format and std::source_location to create a log function for my debug build. My goal is to make a function which expects a std::format-like message (and eventual args), as well as a std::source_location instead of __LINE__ / __FILE__ and others implementation-defined macros for function name.
 At first, I achieved this:
 cpp log(&quot;Hello {}, {}&quot;s, 42, &quot;world&quot;);  Then I wondered if I could avoid specifying template types when calling it, but simply removing it fails to compile because the function has a default std::source_location as last parameter.
 So I decided to directly pass a std::format_args to the log function, here is the code: https://godbolt.org/z/dTbThPK1x Surprisingly, it successfully compiles on GCC 13.2, clang 17.0.1 and clang 18.1.0, but not in GCC 14.1, and I didn&#x27;t get any warning.
 Is there some C++20 constraint which wasn&#x27;t implemented in GCC 13.2 ? Is there something I wasn&#x27;t aware of ? Is this a compiler bug ?
 Thanks to everyone who will take time to read this, have a great day.

                              <span>I rarely code lately and have never worked as a CPP dev professionally. But when I do some CPP code, depending on the problem, I often want to use a bunch of lambdas with [&amp;] inside of larger functions instead of making separate functions with a longer list of reference arguments being passed back and forth.
 Like  this here which is a little exercise my friend gave me regarding filling a grid. In my fillGrid() function I am using 3 lambdas inside of it. What are the drawbacks of doing things this way?

                              <span>Unfortunately for C++ programmers all over the world, there doesn&#x27;t exist a std::string constructor that simply takes a char, so you&#x27;re not able to do something like std::string test(&#x27;A&#x27;) (does anyone have an explication for this?).
 Of course, this leads to super frustrating / non-intuitive behavior and introduces tons of hidden bugs, but it is what it is.
 However, I recently discovered the following code snippets, and for the life of me I cannot understand why this works this way, and I was wondering if someone could explain the rationale behind this (tested of both gcc and clang).
 If you write :
 std::string test &#x3D; &quot;STRING&quot;; std::string test2 &#x3D; test[0]; 
 You, (of course, anyone would have guessed I&#x27;m sure) get a compilation error, because test[0] returns a char which cannot be converted to a string.
 However, if you write :
 std::string test &#x3D; &quot;STRING&quot;; test &#x3D; test[0]; 
 I would expect the same result, because, well, you&#x27;re still trying to convert a char to a string. However, to my surprise, this actually compiles and works exactly the way you would expect (test &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;S&quot;).
 Could anyone explains this...?

                              <span>Hi, in the initialization of a class let&#x27;s call Foo, it populates a member unordered_set using a shared pointer to another class Bar. Essentially, I want to expose access of the class member to Bar, which shouldn&#x27;t extend the lifetime of nor own the member. What&#x27;s the best practice for doing this? Should I be passing a shared_ptr or a weak_ptr to Bar? I saw this thread on the subject but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s fully relevant to this instance. Thanks for the advice in advance!
 The rough code outline looks like this.
 class Foo { shared_ptr &gt; my_member; Foo(shared_ptr ptr) { my_member &#x3D; make_shared &gt;(); ptr-&gt;populate_member(my_member); // should i pass weak_ptr? } } class Bar { ... void populate_member(shared_ptr &gt; member) { member-&gt;insert(...); } }

                              <span>Hello,
 im following the learncpp course.
 and on the first lessons we had to make this code :
  #include  int main(){ std::cout &quot;/tmp/Microsoft-MIEngine-Out-zto1kj0k.w21&quot; 
 and on the debug console I see this :
  Stopping due to fatal error: InvalidOperationException: No handler registered for request of type &#x27;send-stopped-event&#x27;! 
 How can I solve this ? Or can I better use something like code::blocks on Windows 10.

 If I remove module:private;, it builds well. However, I can&#x27;t understand why declaring private module fragment in module partition interface is forbidden. Can private module fragment only be declared inside a module declaration TU?

 Firstly, https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/data_members#Standard-layout states:
  
A pointer to an object of standard-layout class type can be reinterpret_cast to pointer to its first non-static non-bitfield data member (if it has non-static data members) or otherwise any of its base class subobjects (if it has any), and vice versa. In other words, padding is not allowed before the first data member of a standard-layout type. Note that strict aliasing rules still apply to the result of such cast.
  
Is this relevant to the above? I.e. does dereferencing int_through_a violate strict aliasing because a given standard layout type is not generally similar to its first member? https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion#Similar_types ; https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reinterpret_cast#Type_accessibility ; or is it fine because we know there is an object of type int at this address even though the pointer is obtained from a reinterpret_cast? 
 Secondly, is it correct that skipping the line (i.e. initializing int_through_b) is UB?

                              <span>Hey guys. I am C++ beginner. I have finished basics of C++ such as pointers and OOPS. I need help regarding projects as it is difficult to find project ideas for C++ compared to other languages like JS. Can you guys please suggest some projects and also libraries or frameworks used.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Recently started a role in a company that has a moderate sized C++ codebase (embedded) and while browsing the code on day one I found some things that have frustrated me so badly that I&#x27;ve started dreaming in code (again - yes we&#x27;ve all done it at some point but I thought those days were long gone).
 I&#x27;d love to hear the community&#x27;s feedback on the following items that stood out to me...
 The entire system is instantiated by including header files in to main.cpp - in those headers there&#x27;s a huge number of global variables being defined. i.e: (not actual code but conveys the point).
 system.h
 #ifndef _system_h #define _system_h #include &quot;board.h&quot; #include &quot;...&quot; // all the various classes. ClassA global_a(); ClassB global_b(global_a); ClassC global_c(board_global_a, board_glob…</span>

 This is what I have now:
 class Entity
 {
 [..]
 Light myLight; // this is used for few entities only
 }
 Instead of allocating it for every Entity, I thought about doing this:
 class Entity
 {
 [..]
 std::unique_ptr myLight; 
 }
 So when I instantiate an entity, I look if I need the light or not and only if I need I create the unique pointer. Does this make sense or there is a better way of doing it? I&#x27;m not doing straight ECS because it&#x27;s my first project

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m working on a C++ library implementing a heuristic algorithm for the Set Covering Problem: github.com/c4v4/cft
 The SCP is a classic combinatorial optimization problem that asks, given a set and a collection of subsets, to find the minimum-cost group of subsets that covers everything in the original set. You can find SCPs in crew scheduling or test selection, for example.
 Currently, commercial MILP solvers like Cplex or Gurobi are often the go-to option for SCPs. But, while they are powerful, well-designed heuristics can often achieve even better results (especially when the available time is tight).
 Our implementation is based on the work of Caprara, Fischetti, and Toth. It was originally developed for a research project, but we&#x27;ve decided to clean it up and make it publicly available as a free, high-performing alternative.
 We also hope the library serves as a helpful companion to the original paper, which can get a bit technical at times.
 Since this is our first real open-source contribution, any constructive feedback is welcomed. We hope this library will prove helpful.
 Thanks!

I have worked with sockets in both C# and Java for different kinds of applications ranging from game servers to web servers. So I am quite familiar with it at this point. One of them is on GitHub: AdvancedSockets. Also, while I work on both Windows and Linux I primarily use Linux desktop.
 This month I decided I like to learn more about doing socket programming in C++ as a project I am working on could benefit from this. A quick research pointed me to some SO articles and tutorials. But all of them are using the socket API in C. Not once did I find anything about a high-level socket library in C++.
 Okay.. no prob right? I decided to give C sockets a try. Surely it isn&#x27;t that hard? After all I got experience already! And sure enough it didn&#x27;t take m…</span>

I tried calling friend function using ::fun(Class obj) to check whether it was accessible globally but it&#x27;s not.But it&#x27;s not possible to call using object as well.What actually is happening here??

                              <span>Hi everybody.
 I&#x27;ve tried searching for a term that may answer this question but couldn&#x27;t find such example.
 here&#x27;s what I hope is a brief explanation:
 I have a variable that is used (via reference) across different threads, but it&#x27;s not accessed concurrently due to the flow of execution, if the variable itself is not guarded with a mutex or some atomic mechanism, is one of the threads allowed to assume it has the latest value, and &quot;skip a read&quot; on the next access?
 thread1 and thread2 holds a reference to an int.
 thread1 is requested to print the int to console (so we assume it goes to memory and read it).
 thread2 increments the int.
 thread1 is requested to print the int once again to console, while still holding the same reference as it did earlier.
 My question is, can thread1 assume the value was never changed, and use the older value instead of reading from memory again? or can it hold some cache about this variable and read from it&#x27;s cache and not see the update thread2 did?
 I may be overthinking it, but I want to use an atomic_int and justify my decision rather than going blindly over the safer decision. an atomic_int, I believe guarantees it will go ahead and read the latest value, is that about right?
 if there&#x27;s a specific topic in memory access/thread safety that speaks about this kind of situation I&#x27;d be happy to learn more.
 Thanks!

 I have this piece of code which creates a random linked list of n elements and then reverses it. I am confused about the reverseLL function. I call this function and pass ptrToFirstNode as a parameter. Once, we are inside the function do I specifically need to assign another pointer p&#x3D;ptrToFirstNode ? Can I not just instead do the following because struct node * ptr is replaced by ptrToFirstNode ? Thank you.
 void reverseLL(struct node * ptr){ struct node * q&#x3D;NULL; struct node * r&#x3D;NULL; while(ptr!&#x3D;NULL){ r&#x3D;q; q&#x3D;ptr; ptr&#x3D;ptr-&gt;ptrToNextNode; q-&gt;ptrToNextNode&#x3D;r; } ptrToFirstNode&#x3D;q; }

                              <span>I&#x27;m running into an issue when comparing numerical results between an x86_64 based Linux machine and an arm based Mac. The code boils down to
 double e &#x3D; 12; double d &#x3D; 0.024; int j &#x3D; 44; double start &#x3D; e + j * d; 
 When I do that arithmetic on the x86 machine in the debugger I get

 I get the same number when I do that arithmetic in the debugger on the Mac, but when the start variable actually gets assigned the value ends up being

 It&#x27;s a tiny difference but obviously it compounds with every further calculation (especially later when std::floor gets called when one machine has something like 10.99...9 and the other has something like 11.00...1). I get the concept of floating point precision errors in calculations, but can there be precision errors when assigning a variable? Does this difference seem like it&#x27;s from the compiler or the hardware itself? Or maybe I&#x27;m missing something.
 I have to explain to a group of scientists why they&#x27;re getting such different results on different machines, and as far as I can tell this is where the numerical differences start. So I really want to understand why the difference is happening in the first place.

                              <span>Actually curious. From what I’ve learned over the years, especially during peak covid of 2020- the wfh, 2 hour work weeks and high salaries made everyone want to be a SWE. I had friends constantly boast about sleeping in, playing games during work, and travelinng whilst making 200k+

                              <span>After a long driven search for a summer internship as an international student, I got accepted into a program at a govt. firm in the US. 
 Unfortunately due to me being away from the US, could not submit my documents in person on time (requested for alternative measures but in vain) The role was not technical though, but I chose it as I thought it would help me step into the company and later explore opportunities to go into the tech side but ALAS not anymore ;-;
 Now I feel devastated as I lost this opportunity. Just one day later, I received an email saying I got selected into an AI startup (which seems like a business) where they ask us to pay ~$30 a month to work in their AI labs and they would assign us some work and consider it as an intern opportunity.
 I am confused on what to do? Suggestions? 
 Edit: Researched some and found it’s a big scam! The company is Radical AI and this thread helped:

                              <span>So recently, I&#x27;ve been searching a Linux engineer position. I notice a good portion of listings mention rhel so I ended up installing it on a VM no problem. I get in, I&#x27;m looking around, activate the OS with my trial and learn about it&#x27;s YUMmy package manager.
 I search the documentation, I look at a couple of courses for the rhel certifications and everything turns up fairly basic. The only thing I could really find that was different was the package manager. Now I&#x27;m sitting here thinking what even is the point of rhel? Why do so many companies work with Red Hat? What am I missing here?

Many modern alternatives to Unix CLIs have appeared in the past several years, could there be a successor to tools like ripgrep, lke ripgrep is to grep? Or have we done the best we can for a CLI that searches for text inside files?
 Would they be better of 70s Unix machines or would they lots of rewiriting? How much of the improvements in modern tools are the results of good ideas? Could those ideas have been applied to AT&amp;T Unix utils?
 How much of the success and potential longevitiy of modern Unix tools are due to being hosted online and worked on by many programmers?
 Could computer architectures change significantly in the future, perhaps with ASI designing hardware and software, RAM as fast as CPUs, or photonic chips?

                              <span>So I recently learned that the default gnome web browser actually uses webkit, and I was wondering why this isn&#x27;t more of a thing on linux? I know a huge portion of the linux community has their heart set on gecko, but I feel like linux users hate the chromium monopoly even more than they love gecko. I&#x27;m not a developer so maybe there&#x27;s a good reason why there aren&#x27;t many webkit browsers on the market. Any information on this would be appreciated.

                              <span>Are there any recommendation for an cross platform gui library in c# that does not use xml or an dialect of it or html.
 cross platform in this case means (windows, linux, mac)
 there is no interest in mobile crrently but support for it would be appreciated.
 I have already looked into gtksharp and recently discovered qtdotnet.
 I find it a bit frustrating that even after having c# be cross platform that there is no direct tool to build guis with it. Except for the microsoft developed windows only stuff.

                              <span>This year I&#x27;ve learned WPF, and it&#x27;s been quite an enjoyable development experience (for the most part...). Having reached the end of a work project that had me design a product filtering and sales quote app, I&#x27;m looking for my next project.
 My main thought has been to design a cross platform mobile application that serves as a calculator/utility library that contains useful domain-specific helper programs relevant to my industry. 
 I&#x27;ve been reading about MAUI and Avalonia, but I&#x27;m unsure which one would best suit my simple-ish usecase and require the least amount of up-front learning to get going. 
 Also, any suggestions for resources or inspiration repos would be much appreciated.

 but also this:
 new GetDictionaryResult(); //Id should be int here

 Is it possible to write an app without reliance on winforms and Visual Studio? I&#x27;m using Visual Studio Code for Python and C# but I want my app to be theoretically portable to Linux too.

                              <span>Preface this with a) I know winforms is ancient and b) it could well be that I’m new to programming, C# and winforms, so not using it correctly.
 I’m having a really hard time wrapping my head around doing anything with datagridviews beyond displaying some simple objects. It feels way more complicated/clunky than it should be, but maybe I’m missing something?
 I’m pulling data from a postgres database, wanting to do reporting and have things like a totals row anchored to the bottom, merging objects (joining?). Even properly setting up combobox columns is escaping me. I’m worried that doing anything non-trivial (connected objects where an upstream change should trigger a cascade of changes across other objects and their binding sources/datagridviews?) will be a nightmare to setup.
 Is this just a winforms thing? Is it easier in more modern ui frameworks? Do I just need to learn how to implement them properly?

 I am trying to use the “.NET 5+ and .NET core” debug option but the only option VS code is giving me is “C#”.
 Can someone please explain to me what I am missing?
 Thank you so much

                              <span>Hey guys, after learning java for about 8-9 months, I&#x27;ve tried to apply for some jobs, but I&#x27;ve got a fast reality check. I could see that I don&#x27;t know a lot of theory and I believe that my problem is that I only know &quot;practical&quot; java. So I&#x27;ve wanted to ask you guys, is the book &quot;thinking in java&quot; still relevant? The last release was in 2017, so maybe there is a better book to learn the theory that you can recommend for me. Also if you would have some other tips (what should projects contain, what tools should I learn etc.) for someone like me who is trying to find his first tech job, I would be grateful.
 Thanks for every response, and I hope everyone reading this has a wonderful day!

                              <span>Okay, let me clarify. In the thread about overrated concepts, several people mentioned Uncle Bob and clean code. Again, the principles behind the rules are very useful. After all, software engineering is fighting complexity almost by definition. 
 That said, because of the tone and Uncle Bob&#x27;s authority, those out-of-nowhere rules like &quot;methods can&#x27;t be longer than 5 LOC&quot; or &quot;methods can&#x27;t have more than one parameter&quot; became associated with clean code. 
 A much better book on writing great code is A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout. What I like the most is that John has a very nuanced view on software design, and instead of magic numbers and prohibitions he comes up with useful ideas like deep/shallow modules. This single chapter made me rethink how I write code and think about complexity. 
 As for less philosophical rukes, there&#x27;s a favorite of mine that in my opinion tremendously improves average code. It&#x27;s guard clauses or, simply speaking, early returns. I know, there used to be the opinion rooted in old programming languages that a routine must have only one return. This is fortunately no longer true, and in the language I use 99% of the time (Go) , returning early is one one of the common best practices. 
 What are your favourites?

                              <span>I find since (literally, as in the title changed) becoming a senior dev I&#x27;ve found myself in significantly more &quot;managerial&quot; discussions and doing more of that kind of work (project planning, delegating work, chasing people). 
 I have no issues with doing this, I totally acknowledge that being a more senior engineer means you have to deal with realities of the &quot;business&quot; of software engineering aka staffing, timelines, getting people to agree to help you. 
 But that&#x27;s not all there is, there&#x27;s also just doing technical work and being &quot;close to the ground&quot;. I&#x27;m trying to figure out a balance. How often do you folks find yourselves doing this kind of stuff?

                              <span>I’d like to recommend this book I’ve read a while back (Chip &amp; Dan Heath - Decisive). Many things I&#x27;ve read there continue to echo in my head.
 So this is a book about decision making. The authors researched business decision making primarily, but many of the findings make sense in the context of decisions that developers, especially lead devs regularly make.
 The book mentions common known biases in decision making, such as the famous sunk cost fallacy or loss aversion. But what I like really about the book is that it goes way beyond that and focuses on the process of decision making.
 One of the recommendations is to apply a wide context. For example, instead of asking whether the team should do a certain refactor and discussing pros and cons, a better question is: what can the team do in the X engineering hours granted to code maintenance.
 Another interesting advice was that decision makers should actively reach out for opinions that oppose their preferred choice. If you don’t see any disadvantages with the decision, then chances are you didn’t spend enough time to discover your blind spots, and efforts should be made to at least give a chance for counteropinions.
 Another practice mentioned is preparing for failure: what happens if the decision doesn’t bring the expected outcome? If we start this refactor, what do we do if it gets more complicated than we anticipated? When do we stop it? Do we have a clear way of undoing changes, if necessary? What if our changes designed to improve performance turn out to have a catastrophic effect in production?
 I also really like the pragmatic approach they’ve taken: they collected and analyzed hard data to see what decision making practices correlate with better outcomes.
 Have you read other books that are not really focused on software engineering, but contributed to your practices?

 I have been working for a database company for the last 6 years. This company designed its own proprietary database system and since I had experience working with distributed systems (Paxos algorithms) from grad school, I inherited the DB&#x27;s rudimentary backup and recovery system. Over the years, I took ownership of this product and turned it into an actual product complete with documentation, monitoring, a clean (CLI based) UX, etc. Think something similar to Snowflake backup and recovery.
 The problem though now is that (1) I am bored, and (2) I disagree with the direction the leadership is going. This is an American company and leadership is overseas. The overseas leadership is basically taking a step back and asking us to re-engineer everything to use an older tech stack becaus…</span>

While many posts aren&#x27;t even job-related, virtually every other post is AI-generated rage/click bait. It&#x27;s not useful for referrals, looking for jobs, asking of jobs, etc. 
 I think they are probably on the last leg of money, they aren&#x27;t profitable of course, but I imagine the team is likely a handful of people, 5-8 people tops. CS students, former and current, this reddit board has been more reliable overall.

I do real work for maybe 5 hours a week. Most of the job is tracking the general objectives/milestones for the team and putting it into pretty presentations for the higher-ups. I get bugged occasionally to do this and that, but most of my time is spent doing diddly squat. Why didn’t someone tell me this was a thing before? I am never going back to slaving away as a SWE.

                              <span>I am located in Germany and have been working as a backend developer (C#/.NET) since 8 years now. I&#x27;ve checked out some job listings within the US for fun. Holy shit ....
 I thought I&#x27;ve seen some crazy listings over here that wanted a full IT-team within one person. But every single listing that I&#x27;ve found located in the US is looking for a whole IT-department.
 I would call myself a mediocre developer. I know my stuff for the language I am using, I can find myself easily into new projects, analyse and debug good. I know I will never work for a FAANG company. I am happy with that and it&#x27;s enough for me to survive in Germany and have a pretty solid career as I have very strong communication, organisation and planning skills.
 But after seeing the US listings I am flabbergasted. How do mediocre developers survive in the US? Did I only find the extremely crazy once or is there also normal software developer jobs that don&#x27;t require you to have experience in EVERYTHING?

                              <span>Edit: to clarify, I’m referring to when Mark Zuckerberg in the Social Network dilutes his friend’s shares from a sizeable amount of the company to effectively nothing. 
 As the title says, I recently got an offer from a startup and have a discussion with the founders tomorrow to talk about the offer and go over equity options.
 Are there things I shouldn’t go for? Like certain kinds of stock options or types of equity grants that raise red flags? 
 I’m early enough that I think I could get a general equity percentage but don’t want to ignore other good equity packages.

                              <span>Pretty much the title. I am extremely confused about this.
 I have seen people claim online in articles that it is possible to overwrite GOT entries using format string vulnerabilities even if ASLR is on and the binary has PIE capabilities.
 However, GOT is in the data section of the binary, and afaik, the strongest ASLR setting in Linux (randomize_va_space &#x3D; 2) randomizes the stack and data segments separately. So it is not possible to get the GOT entry addresses via printf format string vulnerability. But this is supposedly a well know exploit method as explained here
 I did not understand the explanation in the article. Can someone help me out on this? If answers are different for 32 bit and 64 bit architectures please tell me their differences as well. Thanks!

                              <span>I have recently installed arch linux and faced a &quot;ping: Temporary failure in name resolution&quot; error. To troubleshoot it I need some packages that i did not get during the installation of the system (for some reason I have internet connection during the installation). Is there a way to install new packages without internet access, because it is very exhausting to reinstall the system every time I find out that I need some other package
 UPD: Turns out the problem was with the network I was trying to connect. Connect to a different one via nmtui and everything fixed

 I see now in Egypt the gov is celebrating the opening for the first time data center in the new capital for sure
 I think that&#x27;s why we need to support Open Souce projects for sure in our region It will help young people like me to do great things by learning how things work
 waiting for your answer
 BTW I don&#x27;t trust the gov but the way we take technology is good for us and people

                              <span>yesterday this post by u/Thereareways had a lot of traffic, and I think it deserves a part 2:
 I have read through all 243 comments and gained a whole new perspective on rust in the process. I think the one key point, which was touched on in a lot of comments, but IMO never sufficiently isolated, is this: Rust is bad at imperfection.
 Code quality (rigor, correctness, efficiency, speed, etc) always comes at the cost of time/effort. The better you want your code to be, the more time/effort you need to invest. And the closer to perfection you get, the more it takes to push even further. That much should be pretty agreeable, regardless of the language. One might argue that Rust has a much better &quot;quality-per-time/effort&quot; curve than other languages (whether this is actually true is beside the …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m senior developer / devops / sysadmin, I know my way around systems, both, Windows and Linux. At home I dual boot Debian Testing and Win11. Windows here is only for games, nothing more. I would love to ditch it, but any attempts were unsuccessful.
 I only install games from Epic Store, as they provide some good free games from time to time. But, I have never ever achieved any success installing them on Linux, yet all the world on internet seems to enjoy and say ezpz. How? ELI5 please?
 I have tried Lutris, Heroic launchers, to no avail. I&#x27;m not friendly with Wine /Proton or any other Windows emulating crap, I try to avoid them, but I can live with this exception if I can ditch dual boot. But I simply cannot comprehend the amound of different configs it have with setting names not rrally saying anything to me. I&#x27;m deeply technical when it comes to code, but I&#x27;m a complete noob when I need to understand GPU config parameters, set to default and go.
 Example games I want to launch AoE2, GTA5, LaraCroft series, EU4, ... Hardware: AMD 7900 + AMD 7900XT Again - Debian Testing.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m trying to install the drivers for my graphics card [GeForce RTX 4060 Max-Q / Mobile] on my Debian GNU/Linux 12 (Bookworm) operating system with GNOME environment, and I&#x27;m having some problems.
 My notebook has a &quot;13th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-13620H × 16&quot; processor and the graphics card mentioned above. However, the operating system only recognizes the integrated graphics card &quot;Mesa Intel® Graphics (RPL-P)&quot; as the active one.
 I&#x27;ve tried several solutions, including:
  
Download and install the .run driver from the NVIDIA website.
 Use nvidia-detect to then install nvidia-driver.
  
But none of these options have worked.
 From what I&#x27;ve read, I should use something called &quot;Optimus&quot; to drive the two graphics cards (the integrated one from Intel and the dedicated one from NVIDIA), but I don&#x27;t quite understand what it is or how to configure it correctly.
 Could you help me install the correct drivers and configure Optimus for my NVIDIA graphics card to work?
 It would be greatly appreciated

                              <span>I have been struggling a lot when it comes to what outside resources are good to emulate and learn from, vs when it becomes a crutch that hinders learning. I would have no idea how to make a compiler, but I think if I had a template I could eventually learn it (by searching everything I don&#x27;t know and slowly assimilating what I find out). Do other people use &quot;templates&quot; like this? 
 If I want to do something ambitious I quickly get overwhelmed just figuring out all the unknown unknowns. I guess experience will help with that, but what resources do experienced people turn to? Documentation? How do you find what you need without reading everything? I have had times where something I made was actually done already in a library I was using and I was just unaware of it lol.
 I feel like I am not really learning, just becoming a more experienced pattern matcher or copying machine. I can make hacky solutions sometimes, but I want to write better and I don&#x27;t know how to bridge that gap without basically copying more experienced people&#x27;s work to try and adopt their style/solutions/decision making process etc...

                              <span>Brief introduction about me i am 24 years old i study computer science and i am proficient at python and good at js and worked with other programming languages like c,c#,PHP,go(just a little bit) and i want to teach somoene for completely free . I would like to teach you programming basics preferably in python or js and help you with beginner projects so you apply the concept you learned (learn a little apply a lot) but in return i want you to help me upgrade my teaching skills and soft skills , like give feedbacks about the way i explain/talk... And if we become freinds that s a plus. I made this post because i kinda have social anexiety and i want to stop out of my comfort zone . P.s: i don t know the hours i can do per week but i think it can be bwetween 1-5hours and i can give you ressources if you want to study on your own , and the learning gonna be via voice calls, if there s more then one person that want that it would be very great and we can make like a group but i doubt it a lot , last thing is i really enjoy teaching pepole even if i am not the best at it :)

                              <span>I started to apply a pattern in the services I&#x27;m writing, and find it ubiquitous ever since. I don&#x27;t remember seeing it in the books I read so far (I read the 100 common mistakes and the Effective Go books).
 I inherited some application and had many problems with properly shutting things down. There was always something that &#x27;stuck&#x27; or lived after it shouldn&#x27;t have... After going a few circles I introduced a rule that is summarized as
  
functions should be synchronous
 if they need to start multiple goroutines to do stuff in parallel, they are free to do that
 but they need to wait until those routines terminate.
  
I also introduced contexts where the previous guy was a bit lazy, and this thing emerged as a pattern. I can be sure that things are properly shut down when the function returns to the caller. There are no more &#x27;ghost effects&#x27; from go routines of the &#x27;past&#x27;.
 Since I started doing this my thinking about handling gorutines completely changed, and I often spot the lack of it in others&#x27; code, then immediately see that they don&#x27;t have the same guarantees about ghosts and termination that I have.
 Sometimes this is a bit hard to do, for example when dealing with Reader.Read() in a goroutine. Because Read() doesn&#x27;t have context and can block for unbounded time. But I always have this ichy feeling that this is somehow bad and figure out a way to make the function behave well (to my standards). I tend to follow it especially within our codebase.
 We do mostly backend stuff, my experience with go is limited to that subject.
 I call this &#x27;leave no goroutine behind&#x27;, but it might have a name already. Wdyt?

                              <span>As the title says. I am curious about ways that people have used Go for things that it can do, but generally not really is the first pick for and what their experience was. For example using Go for machine learning, mobile development or something totally different.

                              <span>I am testing my Gameboy emulator against the &quot;lcdon_timing-GS&quot; Mooneye test ROM. I&#x27;m not sure what exactly the expected behavior is supposed to be.
 I&#x27;ve seen multiple sources say that, after enabling the LCD, the very first scanline on the first frame has different timings from other scanlines, but I can&#x27;t find timing documentation for this anywhere.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve gathered so far:
  
The PPU starts in mode 0 (HBlank) after the LCD is enabled. There is no mode 2 on the first scanline.
 After mode 0, PPU advances to mode 3, which is unusual.
 The PPU advances from mode 3 to mode 0, and remains in this mode until the end of the scanline.
 After scanline 0, the PPU resumes normal operation (mode 2, mode 3, mode 0, etc)
 The PPU starts 2 t-cycles &quot;late&quot;?
 The LCD is blank for the first frame after it is enabled
  
What is the timing for scanline 0? How long does the PPU stay in each mode?
 Are any interrupts requested during the first frame after enabling the LCD?
 How is the PPU started 2 cycles &quot;late&quot; if it starts in mode 0 and jumps straight to mode 3? How can it be late if it starts in HBlank?
 Is there any documentation out there that describes this behavior?
 I had a look at Higan, and it runs mode 0 for 72 clocks, then mode 3 for 172 clocks (according to Kevtris this might need to be 173.5), then back to mode 0 until 456 clocks have elapsed. Is this correct?

 Are there tools that automate some of this work?

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m a high school drop out with computer knowledge, and somehow made a career off of it.
 I never really got in to programming, I can&#x27;t really put my finger on why - but that&#x27;s the way I was.
 However, I landed a job within Software Deployment (Not to be confused with Software Development) where the software I&#x27;m deploying is built in C++.
 I read and &quot;configure C++ every day, deal with NuGet packages, our TFS and Visual Studio, but I don&#x27;t actually know the language, or any language for that matter - except for a basic understanding of SQL and Powershell.
 My question is: If I where to learn programming, would C++ be a good choice for someone who doesn&#x27;t know any language, but work with it daily? Or should I start with something easier like Python?
 My thinking goes like this: If I where to learn Python, I would have to sit with it every day after work hours and learn, but If I learn C++ - I can learn a little bit in my spare time, but still interact with it every day and learn some things from my job.
 My goal is not to become a developer, but to work within cyber security. And to be proficient in that field, I need to learn at least 1 programming language from my understanding.
 Thanks for reading, and have a good day!

                              <span>I am looking for projects that are using ASIO under the hood to get to know a bit better how ASIO&#x27;s constructs can be used in real applications.
 For clarification I went through the examples in boost&#x27;s implementation, however I would like to learn a bit more about complete projects, like boost::beast. If you have any recommendations please share them here.
 I would also be interested in real life examples where a custom executor had to be implemented to solve a problem.

                              <span>I have a bit of prior programming knowledge doing some simple unity games, discord bots in python and even some of the ultra-basics of C++. However, my code tends to be pretty messy/inefficient, and I can&#x27;t do anything complex or even intermediate. I tend to learn best through projects, so if somebody has a list of projects (in order of difficulty) that would help me start to pick up the actual meat and potatoes of the language and overall improve my code quality it would be very helpful. Thanks!

 The post is a bit late, but nevertheless I&#x27;d like to advertise the new version.
 Qbs is a build system originated at Qt and now is developed by the community as a general-purpose build system (mainly for c++, but we also have some support for other languages like java).
 In this release we mainly focused on the better integration with IDE&#x27;s (QtCreator fully supports new features, VSCode doesn&#x27;t use them for now). We also did improvements to the mechanism responsible for locating external libraries, as well as general bugfixes

                              <span>The code compiles and runs fine but it shows the sum as incorrect and shows an error message at last as:
 free(): double free detected in tcache 2 Aborted 
 code:
 #include #include using namespace std; class Matrix { private: int *data; int rows, cols; public: Matrix(int r, int c) { data &#x3D; (int*)malloc((r*c)*sizeof(int)); rows &#x3D; r; cols &#x3D; c; } ~Matrix() { free(data); } void insertdata(); void printdata(); friend Matrix operator +(Matrix &amp;, Matrix &amp;); }; void Matrix::insertdata() { cout&gt;data[(i*cols)+j]; } } } void Matrix::printdata() { cout&gt;d1&gt;&gt;d2; Matrix M1(d1,d2), M2(d1,d2), M3(d1,d2); cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Matrix 1:\n&quot;; M1.insertdata(); cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Matrix 2:\n&quot;; M2.insertdata(); M3 &#x3D; M1 + M2; cout&lt;&lt;&quot;\nSum of both matrices-&quot;; M3.printdata(); return 0; } 
 When I comment out the destructor it seems to work fine and also will produce the correct sum as result. But if I don&#x27;t use the destructor to call free() to free up malloced bytes of *data, won&#x27;t it be a memory leak? Am I doing this wrong? Any additional improvements to the code are also welcome :)

                              <span>Hi, I have a device which is has a register list on the data sheet has a 16 bit data section and a 32 bit data section. It’s all 16 bit addresses. I would like to see example of how to manage the 16 and 32 bit data. I’m getting stuck because I visualize the write()/read() to need a case statement to select between which I2C sequence (16 or 32 bit). Problem with that is I don’t really know how to cleanly define the register lists and include the information is ‘16 bit’ or ‘32’ bit.
 Anyone know any example which implement multiple length data and how to flip back and forth?

                              <span>To give some context, I am going into my third year of EE and I have already taken 2 courses on C (Introduction to programming and data structures &amp; algorithms) and time and time again I constantly get lost whenever pointers are involved, and it’s just so frustrating.
 To make it even more ridiculous, I took a computer architecture course which covered programming in assembly and I had no issues working with pointers, incrementing pointers, grabbing the value from a memory address that a pointer is pointing to; the whole nine yards, it all made sense and everything clicked. 
 But no matter how many videos I watch or how long I spend in the compiler messing around with pointers in C, it just doesn’t click or make any sense. 
 Obviously I picked EE and not CE so coding isn’t my passion, but I want to learn embedded systems and unfortunately it’s mostly C, so sooner or later I need to figure out how to work with pointers.
 Can anyone recommend something I can try out to not only learn how they work, but also how to use them in a practical way that would make more sense to me?

                              <span>Hello, as the title suggest i&#x27;ve to write a few functions to use with linked lists, what i wrote seems to work but wondering if ther&#x27;s any improvement i can make or if i missed an error.
 Basically i need to write functions for :
 initializing the list, adding a node at the start, adding a node at the end, remove a specific node, add a node in the right order, remove a node e finally a function to print the list.
 this is my code, hope everything its clear and any advice or tip is welcome.
 Thanks in advance.

 Basically if I can handle malloc faliure by freeing up some memory and trying again does that actually help anything that&#x27;s not embedded?

                              <span>I have been learning C for 2 years, and I have fun coding very small programs in nasm x64, and I was wondering about the register keyword in C.
 I wrote this function below, and no matter where I implement it (in a simple main or in the middle of a large program like tcsh), it shows me the av arguments of the program.
 I understood that register randomly chose an available register, but why would there be a register containing &quot;av&quot; during the entire program without being modified? And do we know how &quot;register&quot; chooses which register to use? 
 void print_arguments(void) { register char **av; for (int i &#x3D; 0; av[i]; i++) { dprintf(1, &quot;%s\n&quot;, av[i]); } }

Many job search websites require at least three symbols. The approach that, for example, Go uses (golang) is obviously not going to work for C (clang is busy already /s). Do you add something like embedded, kernel, asm or something that usually comes with C?

                              <span>This is a totally random question that just popped into my head, by why do we have malloc, calloc, realloc, and then free? Wouldn&#x27;t dealloc follow the naming convention better? I know it doesn&#x27;t matter but seeing the pattern break just kinda irks something in me 🤣
 I suppose it could be to better differentiate the different memory allocation functions from the only deallocation function, but I&#x27;m just curious if anyone has any insight into the reasoning behind the choice of names.

 Don&#x27;t consider the formatting part of the printf function just think that it take a single parameter of const char* and prints it to the terminal. 
 Question 1:
 How it is creating the terminal (stdout)!! how it is created for windows / linux / mac, how it creates the terminal for different OS ??
 Question 2:
 After opening the terminal how it actually sends the data to the terminal? and how does it know that the terminal is printing the data?

                              <span>Recently, I&#x27;ve been working on implementing dynamic data structures in C with a focus to make it into a dynamically linked library I can port with and use in some other projects I am also doing in C. I implemented a generic dynamic array deque/ring buffer (which copies the data directly into the buffer itself, not storing a void * to it which is then returned later, similar to how Stroustrup discusses compact layout). Based on this structure, I can easily implement dynamically-sized FIFO queues and stacks. I mention all of this because I am seeking advice/guidance on multiple fronts:

 So s1 is a 7 byte string, but somehow I&#x27;m able to concatenate another 7 bytes to the end of it and print it out? I would think this would cause a segfault since I&#x27;m writing to memory that s1 doesn&#x27;t own. Also, I&#x27;m confused why the size of s1 is still 7 bytes even though printf shows me more than 7 bytes worth of data.

                              <span>Been a php / web developer as a hobbyist and as a job for quite some time. I’ve built apps in objective c and on android with Java. However, I’m self taught and never really learned about how computers work (memory allocation, assembly, compilers, etc). I would really like to learn more low level information instead of just programming shit and hope it works. I heard I should learn C or C++. Is that a good idea? If so do you have book suggestions on C or other books to help me get a better grasp?

 Some interesting highlights include: - NVIDIA Vulkan driver NVK is now considered ready for prime time. Distro packagers are now recommended to include &#x60;nouveau&#x60; in the &#x60;vulkan-drivers&#x60; list so that their users can have the option of using it instead of the proprietary NVIDIA driver. - Intel Vulkan driver Anv switched to truly asynchronous VM bind, and Xe support for error dump to debug GPU hangs was added. - Apple OpenGL driver Asahi has reached OpenGL 4.6 and OpenGL ES 3.2 support. - Broadcom Vulkan driver V3DV gained support for VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering. - Arm Mali OpenGL driver Panfrost was prepared for Gen10 (Gxxx), and Vulkan driver PanVK was modernised for better Midgard (Txxx) and Bifrost (Gxxx) support. - All Vulkan drivers have gained support for explicit synchronisation on Wayland and X11.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s what I believe Microsoft (and partners) have in store for the future: they are going all-in on pulling an Apple-style switch to ARM on the PC hardware market. This move has several concomitant side-effects:
  
Making AI a mandatory feature on the PC, with all the juicy free data they will be able to harvest from it. Requiring an NPU (i.e. an AI-capable chip) as a standard on all future PCs.
 Herding all the PC Gamer market onto the XBOX (which will still be Intel/AMD based) and possibly onto other upcoming compatible consoles (there&#x27;s been talk of allowing Steam and Epic marketplaces on the XBOX platform, which would be HUGE... also, a Steam console, anyone?) It&#x27;s possible that the x86_64 architecture will remain in wide use as gaming hardware.
 (Possibly) Locking down the ability of booting Linux or any other OS on such ARM hardware. This should be contested with all the Anti-Trust legal recourse available everywhere. (EDIT: disproved here)
 Setting back the advance of the Linux marketshare at least for a while. 
  
This last point is the one I would emphasize the most: currently, Linux on ARM seems to be kind of an afterthought among developers, and most distributions have builds targeted at the Raspberry Pi and such small platforms. To my knowledge, only RHEL (and its community clones) offer an ARM build with full desktop capabilities, but these seem to be targeted at servers.
 How long until the major Linux distributions catch up with the switch to ARM, and become ready to deliver the current level of software reliability onto the new PCs?
 Easy with the downvoting, people!
 I am presenting my concerns here, I believe these issues should be discussed. No point in burying the post if you don&#x27;t fully agree with what I&#x27;m saying. I would appreciate your opinion and insight, thanks.

                              <span>Been unemployed since January 9th, 2024 I know that&#x27;s not a crazy amount of time to be unemployed but im running out of funds and energy with this job search and the way companies are getting away with treating candidates. 
 For Example: last week I had an interview with a start-up for contract role, they told me I could start on Monday but it needed to be corp-to-corp so I needed to start an LLC and a Business account, okay costed about $100 in total and took half a day to get it all figured out. Monday rolls around, I get an email says they got a lot of interest so they are going to hire a junior or two instead so the $65 an hour job is now $45 an hour but they&#x27;d hire me if I would do it at that rate. Okay, I swallowed my pride and said I could do $45 an hour and haven&#x27;t heard back from them since. 
 Im not quite ready to jump ship just yet but im getting close and wanted to get some thoughts on what other industries/jobs I could pivot to as a software engineer with 4 YOE in start-ups?
 EDIT:
 Apparently, they hired someone else willing to work for less.

 Just how much can it change your overall career trajectory down the line?
 How much do you lose out on in your career if you don&#x27;t join one of these companies?
 Is it all over hyped? Or is there really truth to just how beneficial these companies can be to your career?

                              <span>I work for a 5000+ employee company. We are banned from using any AI tooling for anything company related.
 At the same time, the executives are telling the world that we are AI-ready in marketing and client offerings.
 Has anybody else had to deal with near total blackout of AI tooling?

                              <span>I have been working at a startup as a junior dev for about 4 months now. It&#x27;s literally me and the CTO. We need to build fast and often the CTO will give me pretty big tasks that I don&#x27;t think most juniors would be asked to do by themselves. The good news is, currently, he keeps saying how over the moon he is with my work. He says he&#x27;s never seen a junior learn so fast or produce such high-quality work.
 My secret? GPT4. I write really specific prompts, query different aspects if I don&#x27;t understand the logic, prompt more and sometimes manually debug. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am learning. I don&#x27;t just throw in code until I understand what is going on and I also use GPT as my tutor to learn more about the tech stack.
 My worry though is that I&#x27;m not building up the problem-solving skills required by more senior engineers. Some of the logic GPT implements would have taken me ages to get right as a junior - but maybe that struggle is a necessary step for my development?
 Do more senior people here see there being long term issues with my approach? My concern with using GPT4 less is that I&#x27;ve set a standard at work which would probably drop massively without it.

                              <span>Hello there, I&#x27;d like to write here a workaround that worked perfectly for me. I faced a particular issue during an update: the package icu responsible for shared libraries did not update properly and let my system inusable (pacman, yay and many other applications refused to work due to a &quot;missing shared library object file: libicuuc.so.75&quot;, stored in /usr/lib). So after some research I managed to get out from this situation. Since pacman and yay were unusable, I couldn&#x27;t neither install packages locally, maybe importing them from another OS, so I found it difficult to get out. I&#x27;m writing this post because in the last days I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people complaining about the same issue with the same package. So if pacman is working, it&#x27;s enough to perform a full update and let pacman properly …</span>

 Would I be able to install arch linux arm on these laptops? In case I can, what is the difference between arch linux arm and normal arch linux? Are there some applications that cannot run on this distributions? would I notice the difference between vanilla arch? 
 In case I can&#x27;t, what about macbooks with their sillicon chips? I saw somewhere that someone installed arch on one of those but I don&#x27;t remember where or if there was a reliable way of doing it. 
 I would just like to try arch with an arm based chip and I don&#x27;t now if this is possible.

 But when I tried &quot;poweroff -h&quot;, to see options, it powered off my pc. Thankfully no work was open, as I wanted to power off anyway.
 As all commands follow that -h is either help or nothing, shouldn&#x27;t the core util command also follow this, especially when it is this dangerous??

 i want to switch to Arch but theres one question left. Is it that Hard?
 In my Mind Arch Linux is hard and isn&#x27;t for the People that just want it to work, like Windows.
 I Currently Dual Boot Windows and Ubunut and have 2 Linux Servers so i know some of the Basics. I want to use it more since at my work as a IT Admin Linux is getting a bigger Role every Bad update Windows makes.

 The comment is made against the proposal in commit 2bf978f9.
 We appreciate the effort to standardize mirror management in the Arch Linux community through an RFC. However, this RFC fails to address critical issues in the current situation. It introduces major inconveniences or even inabilities for existing mirrors to comply with.
 We, as mirror administrators and maintainers, unanimously present our views as follows.
 Problems with the RFC
 1. The method for Validation of Ownership is fundamentally broken.
 The currently proposed method of &quot;signed domain+lastupdate&quot; does not actually protect any party from the presumed domain hijacking situation. In the event of a hijacked domain, the h…</span>

 The last few days I dusted off an old program of mine.
 It’s a renderer for 2d heightmaps, I added support for normal maps, lighting using them, and cleaned up / optimized the thing a bit.
 I also packaged it up on NuGet if you would like to use it for some reason.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m wondering how someone would get the file path or file name as a string when using &quot;open with&quot; in the context menu in Windows. For example, if I write a program like a PDF reader and intend to use the &quot;open with *this program\*&quot; feature in Windows, how can I get the file name? IE if I want to save the file path and name in a JSON database so I can remember the coordinates and states of the file for the next opening.

                              <span>I still have many doubts about &quot;Fody/Propertychanged&quot;.
 I would like to know if this piece of code that I refactored:
 public Player CurrentPlayer { get; private set; } public void OnCurrentPlayerChanged() { if (CurrentPlayer !&#x3D; null) { CurrentPlayer.OnLeveledUp -&#x3D; OnCurrentPlayerLeveledUp; CurrentPlayer.OnKilled -&#x3D; OnPlayerKilled; } if (CurrentPlayer !&#x3D; null) { CurrentPlayer.OnLeveledUp +&#x3D; OnCurrentPlayerLeveledUp; CurrentPlayer.OnKilled +&#x3D; OnPlayerKilled; } } 
 ... is equivalent to this one (original version):
 public Player CurrentPlayer { get &#x3D;&gt; _currentPlayer; private set { if (_currentPlayer !&#x3D; null) { _currentPlayer.OnLeveledUp -&#x3D; OnCurrentPlayerLeveledUp; _currentPlayer.OnKilled -&#x3D; OnPlayerKilled; } _currentPlayer &#x3D; value; if (_currentPlayer !&#x3D; null) { _currentPlayer.OnLeveledUp +&#x3D; OnCurrentPlayerLeveledUp; _currentPlayer.OnKilled +&#x3D; OnPlayerKilled; } } }

                              <span>Today we use Azure DevOps Pipelines to grab KeyVault secrets, replace tokens in appsettings.json during deployment, and then copy the app to our on-premise self hosted IIS farm. We do this during build because the Pipeline has easy access to the vaults.
 We now pay for CyberArk and they are asking about secret rotation. Plus they do not like plain text secrets on the IIS server which is understandable. Since I apply my secrets during build ill have to re-think that.
 I know theres a KeyVault Config provider but since im on IIS I have to use Azure creds (which expire!) and still store that somewhere.
 Is there a better way to do what I am trying to do?

 I need to emulate a USB CDC device on one of my laptop&#x27;s USB ports, then connect to it as a serial port and send data from a WPF application - not sure if this is remotely possible even?
 Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.

 So nowadays, is there any new talk about any realistic plans to bring discriminated unions to C# in the upcoming language versions?
 I&#x27;ve been following the GitHub issue discussion, but it seems to die every now and then

Join Mads and Dustin as they show off a long list of features and improvements coming in C# 13. This year brings long-awaited new features like extensions and field access in auto-properties, as well as a revamped approach to breaking changes to ensure cleaner language evolution in years to come. Additionally, we take collection expressions to the next level by facilitating dictionary creation and opening params to new collection types.
  
 Proposal: Semi-Auto-Properties; field keyword
 Extensions
 After several years, semi-implemented properties are finally coming to C#. I won&#x27;t deny that I&#x27;d love Union types too, but it&#x27;s good enough. The use of “in” as syntactic sugar for “Containts” could also come along, if you want to support the idea here&#x27;s the link.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I have been a C# developer for 12 years. I have been around a while. Now, with the rise of AI. I am very confident that AI will not replace developer....
 But... the amount of increase in developer productivity is amazing.
 In the past, I would have to copy and paste, or re-write the same boiler plate code over and over again. Now, boom, its done. I just need to read the generated code, and make a few small changes and its done.
 I feel like I am lucky because I know how to write code in C#, and the AI enhancements just adds to productivity, instead of being reliant on it.
 Also, the AI assistant with Jet brains is pretty good. It can generate dummy data with hard coded GUID&#x27;s and everything. Pretty neat stuff.

                              <span>Hello c# community! 👋
 I&#x27;m excited to share a free open-source tool I&#x27;ve been working on called AD Sync Manager. If you manage Active Directory and Azure AD synchronization in your environment, this might be useful for you!
 https://github.com/TheITApprentice/AD-Sync-Manager
 AD Sync Manager is designed to help streamline and simplify the AD to Azure AD sync process. It provides an easy way to monitor sync status, get alerted on issues, and manage sync cycles.
 With this tool, you can:
  
View the status of your AD Connect sync cycles
 Get notified if delta or initial sync fails
 Manually trigger full or delta syncs
 Analyze sync errors to identify objects with issues
 And more!
  
It&#x27;s built with PowerShell so it should be easy to deploy in most AD/Azure environments. I&#x27;m actively developing it and welcome any feedback or suggestions.
 If you struggle with keeping your on-prem and cloud directories in sync, give AD Sync Manager a try. Let me know if you have any questions - I&#x27;m happy to help!
 Hopefully this tool saves you some time and headaches. Let me know what you think! 😊

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently changed roles and company, going from a managerial position into IC. Since joining it&#x27;s become apparent that progression will be harder than i expected and I am in fact being moved under other less senior staff than I expected to report into. I had hoped to gain deeper technical skills in the role from learning from colleagues, but more often than not, I am actually training them on software. It&#x27;s MLE, but most data work is dashboards and slides.
 I&#x27;ve only been here a few months but it&#x27;s getting me down, because I left behind a company i had progressed well at, and am constantly second guessing if I am losing momentum in my career and potentially letting hard gained skills rust away whilst doing duties needed here.
 My question is really - how do you know when to cut your losses on a move like this, and when to ride it out ? If moving is best, any tips for framing the experience and reasons for leaving?
 I know flavours of this question get asked regular but would be grateful for any thoughts :) thanks

                              <span>I recently released my first ever proc-macro called pack_bools. It was a nice mix of frustration and joy as i had to navigate around syn, proc-macro2, quote and all the other tools. Some problems I encountered was that while syn was awesome for parsing the TokenStream, there was really no easy way to instantiate the AST structures from it, and I was kind of lost in how I was supposed to quote structures I had destructured. Also, it was quite hard to debug, I often got error messages like unexpected ,, but even with cargo expand it was sometimes invisible. But, I managed at last, and I am proud of the final product. Feedback highly appreciated!
 As a quick decription, the macro turns structs looking like this: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;rs use pack_bools::pack_bools;
 [pack_bools]
 [derive(Debug, Clone)]
 struct Config { output_name: &amp;&#x27;a str, verbose: bool, pub use_colors: bool, original_file: &amp;&#x27;a std::path::Path, legacy_mode: bool } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 into structs looking like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;rs
 [derive(Debug, Clone)]
 struct Config { output_name: &amp;&#x27;a str, original_file: &amp;&#x27;a std::path::Path, packed_bools: u8 }
 impl Config { /* getters and setters for the fields, with the same visibility as the fields */ } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I also added lots of configuration options, inspired by serde, so you could do #[pack_bools(newtype)] to use the newtype pattern for the packed bool field, and much more. I looked around at crates.io a bit before making this, but didn&#x27;t quite find anything just like this; I found some macros that generated bitfield-structs, and some macros that could expand a u8 field into multiple boolean fields with getters and setters, but I like the &quot;clean&quot; interface this crate provides.
 As said, feedback greatly appreciated!

The real “Hall of Fame-y” ones you’d highly recommend, especially to others in your field. Can be beyond Rust - but asking here because Rust blogs are particularly great. 
 My colleague and I are writing a book on writing engineering blog posts. We want to hear the community&#x27;s thoughts on why certain blog posts are read to the end, shared, and remembered -- and also crowdsource a few more really interesting ones that we can work into our discussion.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently Interviewing One of the things I&#x27;ve very much noticed in technical projects you all asking for way too much and you are being far too specific. 
 When you&#x27;re interviewing and I&#x27;ve been on both sides of this bench you&#x27;re looking for very specific things on a technical level. that is Creativity compliance and ability.
 1: Your technical stack is 100% irrelevant , What is important is knowledge of that ecosystem. 
  
Using spring, or vue or nextjs, or steve! make a thing 
  
Is good! It allows some flexibility and Shows compliance and knowledge of the ecosystem you are working in.
  
You must use the Dave package 
  
Is always terrible, it Is going to result in the exact same implementation practically every time and teaches you nothing.
 2: Do not ask for a specific feature, ask for a feature to be created, allow them to be creative and give a time frame on how long it should take And some guidance on things you&#x27;ll be looking for. 
  
Make me a feature we are looking for it to be Very scalable and used by millions of people every day.
  
A developer will look at this and think how can I demonstrate scalability on a feature.
  
Make me a voting application at 10:00 o&#x27;clock have a email to Frederick
  
This is crap, You&#x27;re gonna have exactly the same result every time and teaches you nothing.
 3: Do not ask for more than one application to be built if you are asking for a restful api ask for it to be completed with tests (Functional/ Unit / Postman) not a ui , Building a ui for a application is another application especially if it&#x27;s an spa. 
 Don&#x27;t waste anyone&#x27;s time like for real.
 These are just three simple rules for a better experience than and better candidates.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I was looking for updates about vavr, and I found this post : https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/fccenh/is_vavr_dead/ 
 So, same question than 4 years ago, is there any hope that version 1.0.0 will ever be released ?
 Or should we just move on ?

                              <span>Hey everyone, so I&#x27;m pretty new to this side of the gaming industry and I&#x27;m really missing a great many 6th generation games that have become pretty pricey to obtain sadly (looking at you Eternal Darkness and Xenosaga 3) so I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out if there&#x27;s any preloaded emulation systems that might be worth checking out, I&#x27;ve found a few but have no idea what systems they have. It&#x27;s also worth mentioning before people tell me to get a computer, I have a decent gaming computer I just for the life of me cannot figure out what I&#x27;m doing with retroarch or it&#x27;s settings: PS2 games refuse to even load and causes a retroarch crash, GameCube games stutter so hard I feel like I did a half ounce of mushrooms. Thank you for any helpful information, I&#x27;m going to attach a link to the emulator system I was previously talking about. I don&#x27;t need any tech support just trying to find the right system.

I think Physics Engine is a good choice as as I&#x27;d learn a lot about algebra/geometry, how to efficiently convert maths logic into programming logic, and algorithms. On the other hand, I&#x27;m unsure about how Emulator development can be educational. Like I don&#x27;t know what new knowledge I&#x27;ll gain after completing my project. Please help me decide 🙏

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m curious if Go can be effectively used for machine learning and AI projects. How does it compare to other languages like Python? Are there any recommended libraries or tools in Go for these tasks?
 Thanks!

 Coming from an embedded systems background, I&#x27;m looking to add tools to my skills. Can you guide me if it&#x27;s worth a shot to learn Go as embedded software engineer? What are the career prespectives?

                              <span>Hey guys, i released my first release version for pathfinder. It is somewhat an alternative to &#x60;cd&#x60; command. With pathfinder, you can pass just the directory name and it will change your working directory. It also supports full path, if thats what you want to provide as input.
 This is kinda my first project i did with Go. I had a lot of fun building this and now my focus is on decreasing its runtime. I am looking into goroutines and some algorithms to see if i can decrease its current execution time. Pathfinder only searches inside the users home directory instead of the whole root.
 This was also my first time trying to implement some sort of a cache.
 It would be helpful if yall can provide some feedback and criticism for this. It would help me understand what i did wrong with this.
 The link to the repo : https://github.com/vyshnav-vinod/pathfinder
 Thank you :)

                              <span>I recently interviewed for a company that is essentially a trading firm. As part of the final round, I was given an assignment that I was supposed to complete in 2 days. I had to pull an all nighter over the weekend to complete this. But then I got to know that my assignment was rejected. I am really unable to understand what mistakes I did that led to my rejection. This is my solution: https://github.com/pratikdaigavane/trading-leaderboard. The problem statement is present in the Github repository it self. Guys please help me understand what went wrong here and what things I can improve upon.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m looking for a C2 (Command and Control) framework that supports SOCKS5 communication between the target and the server. The server needs to be hosted as a hidden service (.onion), and the implant (reverse shell) should connect to the server&#x27;s .onion address. Does anyone have any recommendations?
 Why am I looking for this? All the C2 frameworks I have seen suggest using a second server as a proxy to mask the real IP of the attacker. This incurs costs since you need to rent a server and do so anonymously. From what I’ve seen, TOR offers this possibility completely free of charge. Additionally, you can run an entry or exit node at home without much hassle.
 Thanks!

I try to talk sometimes but only 1 line answers. So were supposed to come at 10 but theres a few 30 mins period before we get started. During that one time we jist sit in 1 room all staring at our phones its so awkward its acc hell 😭 
 To be clear I am an extrovert but I am only a level 8 extrovert I cant adopt 6 awkward introverts at once. I will need to unlock atleast level 15 in the extroversion skill tree for that.

                              <span>I’m thinking of learning coding and these are the two options I know about from friends that are the best free options. 
 To those who have used these resources, which one would you recommend I begin with? For 100Devs, I was just going to follow along with his first cohort Youtube playlist.

                              <span>Ive always wanted to make video games but coding and programming and the fear of not being up to standards of my favorites have held me back. 
 How did you overcome and thrive with coding? 
 Did you find a teaching source that helped you enjoy and feel good about learning?
 In some communities I get made fun of for my still being stuck at step “not started” or called pathetic but I’m desperate to fly.
 EDIT: It says fear but I really meant frustration

                              <span>Hey everyone! I found a great website where you can find free open-source projects in different languages and categories. You can use these projects for free and even check out live demos before downloading the code. I&#x27;ve been using it and think you should too. Check out OpenSourceCollection!

                              <span>No matter which computer I try installing Debian on, the setup is always in a very low resolution, making it very difficult to navigate.
 I recall having gone through an installation with a normal resolution in the past, but that may have been on a legacy boot machine. The Linux VGA parameter doesn&#x27;t seem to do much on UEFI.

 I think it&#x27;s much simpler and more intuitive to use. Maybe some of you who build Debian packages will find that too.

                              <span>Hello everyone! My name is Jordan and I am the developer of Stipple Effect, which is a pixel art editor with animation capabilities that I have been developing on my own for the past six months! I am in the home stretch now. I have just released the penultimate major update before the editor&#x27;s full release, which basically marks the software as feature-complete, so I figured now is the best time to share what I&#x27;ve been working on!
 Why?
 You might be asking yourself why I would go through all this effort when there is plenty of state-of-the-art software available at various price points depending on one&#x27;s budget.
 I develop games as a solo indie dev in my spare time. It is something that I would like to keep doing and potentially take more seriously in the future. I have a couple of game i…</span>

                              <span>Bit of a rant but I&#x27;m genuinely trying to understand my users a little better and would love to get input on this from other mobile devs and/or users: 
 Just got a 5-star review from a user that said they love the game &quot;aside from paying&quot; for it. Just to give some background, it&#x27;s a freemium mobile word game with $5 premium option (includes extras, ad removal and access to an extra game mode). 
 I&#x27;m just having trouble understanding that mentality... Why does it seem like most people will pay $10 for a Frappuccino they&#x27;ll enjoy for five minutes but expect a mobile game they can theoretically play forever to be free? And then if it is free, they complain about the ads?
 Is it the mobile game market that has set those expectations? Is it the non-traditional casual gamers who are less willing to pay for games in general (which doesn&#x27;t make logical sense to me - if you like something, you should be willing to pay for it, imo). Is it something else?
 Admittedly, I&#x27;m not the most savvy business person... just a designer/developer who enjoys making stuff. But I feel the product is worth way more than $5 so it&#x27;s really disappointing when I read a paradoxical review that simultaneously raves about the quality of the game and treats it like it&#x27;s worthless.

                              <span>Yesterday evening was special. Knowing I&#x27;d wake up to finally releasing my first game, it was difficult to fall asleep because of all the excitement. But waking up today brought even more excitement. Because the day has come: it&#x27;s finally the 22nd of May.
 My game developer journey started when I was in kindergarten, making point and click games in PowerPoint. You might argue that PowerPoint is not the best game engine and I would totally agree with you. But if you can&#x27;t read yet, then perhaps it is.
 Going further in my life, I never stopped making games. Every month it was something else, but never something I could finish. A few years ago, I got very close, when I assembled a team of developers with a friend of mine and we started working on a horror game. The game was called Pavor, whi…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been a coder all my life but only doing it professionally for about 5.5 years. I am 100% self-thought. I&#x27;ve built up a way of doing things over the years that work for me.
 I try to keep myself up to date of most of the latest dotnet and c# stuff. As well as code patterns and architectures.
 However I often notice that I tend to fall back onto &#x27;comfortable&#x27; patterns because at some point when I&#x27;m coding i go into auto-pilot mode. For instance, I will often use exceptions for control flow even though that is a big no-no. I consciously know it&#x27;s a faux-pas but often only realize when I&#x27;m nearly done with a project that I&#x27;ve once again made the same &#x27;mistakes&#x27; I always do.
 Does anyone else experience this, or do you know of a way to be more mindful of your coding style?

                              <span>I’m confused… it basically looks like how in Python you can make a function pointer, like count &#x3D; complex_counter, and then just call count() to do the complex counting instead of using the longer name. 
 But I know there’s so much more to that, and in C# there’s more than just treating the function as a variable and passing it around right? 
 I see there must be a matching signature to use the delegate that was declared, but how does this “glue” event handler logic so it’s easy for us?

 I am trying to write a decent implementation of Kendall&#x27;s correlation and I came up with this https://github.com/pachadotdev/capybara/blob/main/src/05_pairwise_correlation.cpp, and I wonder how can I improve my computation. I tested against the usual cases (i.e., x &#x3D; {1,2,3} and y &#x3D; {3,2,1} that has Kendall Cor &#x3D; -1) and for the values in the between the extremes I just get a decent approximate value.
 Here is my code:
 #include &quot;00_main.h&quot; // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient // concordant: // Any pair of observations (xi, yi) and (xj, yj), where i xj and yi &gt; yj holds or both xi &lt; xj // and yi &lt; yj // cor &#x3D; 1 - 2 * &quot;number of non-concord…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a simple logger for my game engine and it seems that most people use macros for this over functions for two reasons:
  
It gives access to helpful macros like __FILE__ and __LINE__
 
They are easily able to be stripped away from the source code in distribution builds
 
 However, for reason #1, C++20 now provides std::source_location which solves this issue and for reason #2 it seems like this is possible by just #ifdef&#x27;ing the body of the log function with a DEBUG parameter. It&#x27;s commonly advised to avoid macros unless you really need them or maybe if they simplify the code greatly, but I don&#x27;t feel like that either of those apply here as logging can be achieved without them and the code is still very elegant.
 I ran two examples in Godbolt to test this and noticed that the ass…</span>

                              <span>Hello!
 I have become interested in AD within C++ and especially in Clad and Enzyme, since these frameworks have the potential of providing very high-performance derivatives and to an already-existing code. Enzyme even seems to potentially integrate relatively well with some existing libraries that are not header-only via static linking and LTO.
 My question is, is there any project, no matter how small, that I can look at that had any experience, successful or not, of using these frameworks? Maybe I was not thorough enough in my search, but I just can&#x27;t find any...
 Or share your own experience in the comments :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get it where Visual Studio Code works so I can code in c++ so I can port my python projects to c++ (mostly because c++ has the goto function and python3 doesn&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t want to learn python2 and thought c++ looked more enjoyable to code in than python2). I&#x27;m trying to get it set up to be able to code in/program in c++, but I keep getting an include error saying that features.h is a dependency of iostream, but I don&#x27;t know what that is, or how to fix the issue. I just wanted to port my stuff over and use the goto function...
 Extra information: I have mingw installed, as well as g++ and gcc because I wanted to make sure it&#x27;d work on all platforms, but I&#x27;m starting to feel a bit in over my head at installing things to try to get it to work...

                              <span>So I get the whole paradigm about having a completely valid, initialized object as soon as it comes into being via the &quot;resource acquisition&quot;.
 However, it seems to me that this is the much less important part of RAII. The more imporant part being: objects out of scope release their resources automatically. 
 The destructor releasing the resources (e.g. a lock_guard releasing a mutex) is much harder to get right because releasing it manually would have to occur at the end of the scope. Conversely, if we weren&#x27;t allowed to use a constructor, it wouldnt be as hard to manage, because the initialization would usually follow closely after the resource allocation. 
 Consider the following example: 
 int fun() { SomeBigObject* o &#x3D; new SomeBigObject(); // assume empty constructor // 1. Initialize o-&gt;name &#x3D; &quot;someName&quot;; o-&gt;number &#x3D; 42; // ... // 2. Stuff happens, maybe early return, maybe exception delete o; // 3. Missing this is much more consequential! } 
 Now lets assume SomeBigObject does have a more useful constructor, with the initalizations I made to be done there, but no destructor. Taken literally, you would have &quot;acquired the resources&quot; and &quot;initialized them&quot; with only a constructor - even though this is not what is generally understood by RAII, which usually entails the destructor that does the cleanup when something goes out of scope.
 ​
  
Am I missing something or is there another good reason that I&#x27;m missing?
 Why couldnt the committee think of a better name? It confused me a lot in the beginning. I think something like &quot;Ownership &amp; Valid intialization as a class invariant&quot; or something.

 Just a note to say that we have had to change the format of this post slightly compared to previous posts we have done as unfortunately Reddit&#x27;s spam filters have been blocking our previous posts (probably because it has too many links).
 So this Reddit post will now be a roundup of any new news from upcoming conferences with then the full list now being available at https://programmingarchive.com/upcoming-conference-news/

                              <span>Hello,
 I am a person who recently joined their first company a couple months ago. The role is decent, the pay is great… but the tech is outdated. We are still on C++17 at my firm and while I have learned some things during my time at this company, my company is in an industry where low latency programming is really important, and when I interviewed for other companies in the industry, they made it abundantly clear that expertise of C++20 and above is crucial for the industry.
 I would like to get more modern C++ programming experience while I stay in this role so that I have some job mobility in case my future in this company goes awry. For those of you in jobs where the tech is behind, how do you manage to keep up? I’ve started reading some books on modern C++ programming and I’ve been trying to find open source projects to work on, but I haven’t really found many projects online that make use of a lot of the modern C++20 syntax (e.g. concepts, ranges, even older stuff like CRTP). Would appreciate any input!
 Edit: think there are people dming me with the assumption that I’m just a beginner who just started cpp programming. Listen, I don’t claim to know everything but I’m not a dumbass either (so don’t patronize me), I am really just looking to get more experience working with implementing real systems with more modern (++20 and above) C++. I work in the trading industry, which is why I bring up C++20 specifically as that’s become standard with other competitors but is not largely available in the firm I work with yet.

                              <span>While i was working on a Raylib project i came across this issue that took me a while to find the root of, the following is a simplified recreation:
 customlib.h &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;cpp
 ifndef CUSTOMLIB_H
 define CUSTOMLIB_H
 typedef struct foo{ int data; }foo;
 inline int doStuff(int n){ return n*2; }
 endif
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 main.cpp &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;cpp
 include 
 include &quot;customlib.h&quot;
 include &quot;MyClass.hpp&quot;
 int main(){ int temp &#x3D; doStuff(42); MyClass myclass; myclass.printFooVec(); return 0; } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 MyClass.hpp &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;cpp
 pragma once
 include 
 namespace Cuslib{
 include &quot;customlib.h&quot;
 }
 class MyClass{ private: std::vector m_fooVec; public: void printFooVec(); }; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 MyClass.cpp &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;cpp
 include 
 include 
 include &quot;MyClass.hpp&quot;
 namespace Cuslib{
 include &quot;customlib.h&quot;
 }
 void MyClass::printFooVec(){ Cuslib::foo temp; temp.data &#x3D; Cuslib::doStuff(420); m_fooVec.push_back(temp); for(const auto&amp; element : m_fooVec){ std::cout &lt;&lt; element.data &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot;; } std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl; } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Despite the implementation file (MyClass.cpp) having free access to the customlib methods and types, the header (MyClass.hpp) is completely unable to access anything from it, returning a compilation error if you try to use the &quot;foo&quot; struct under any context. This is all because the &quot;#include &#x27;customlib.h&#x27;&quot; back at the main.cpp file is not wrapped with the Cuslib namespace, when you add it the whole code compiles as normal. Does anyone have any idea on why that happens?

 Why does the compiler allow checker1 but not checker2? Am I missing something? There are lots of cases where I want my requirement to allow different return types. For example, I may want to allow some function to return std::tuple or std::tuple or std::tuple or ...

                              <span>Although I have some experience with C from a few years ago, I&#x27;m still a beginner when it comes to programming complex applications. I&#x27;m struggling with structuring a project in C++. Writing everything in a single file becomes difficult to maintain.
 I&#x27;ve tried splitting systems into different CPP files, but I often need the same function or variable in multiple files. When I use header files, I encounter multiple declaration errors, even with #pragma once. I also attempted to use the MVC pattern, but I faced similar issues. I can&#x27;t seem to create a generic loop in the main file that can pass and receive data from the MVC modules without including the same header in different files, which again leads to multiple declaration errors. Any advice on how to properly structure a C++ project and manage multiple files would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I have a class that has a pointer to an array as a field and that field gets deleted at destructor. My currrent solution to this problem is to create objects on heap and return a reference to them but theres a lot of this class instances being created in my code(with operators+,-, etc.) so i often need to store every result at a reference variable and perform following operations on them instead of inlining them. And need to delete them at the end of every function. How can i prevent this?
 Would overloading evey operator with rvalue reference parameters help, does move sematics work on heap objects? 
 I could also remove the destructor from class, create a child of it with destructor, and (and add a constructor that takkes base as parameter and copies it) and return the base class instance at end of every function(but their return signature will be child). Would instance created automatically by this way also be automatically deleted?

But as far i know Python is best for AI / ML. But if I start learnning Python i have to learn C++ Separately. 
 What should i do in this matter?

 a library that encrypts and another library that compress files and decompress
 using the fileapi of windows.
 can you recommend me the following
  
its open source or free software
 has documents, manpages, and tutorials
 uses the windows fileapi 
 [optionally] if the library is universal to all filesystems
 not obscure
 [optionally] small src code
  
i appreciate it if you recommended me.

Every week I have quizzes and I only have a less than 10 minutes to answer all the questions, and they sometimes cover very specific cases that would be impossible to guess unless I had written the exact same code and run it. I would prefer if they covered these types of questions so that I can practice more. Thanks

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently working on a C++ assignment and could really use some assistance. The assignment details are as follows:
 The assignment says: Write a class named TestScores. The class constructor should accept an array of test scores as its argument. The class should have a member function that returns the average of the test scores. If any test score in the array is negative or greater than 100, the class should throw an exception. Demonstrate the class in a program.
 This is what I wrote:
 This is my current implementation:
 include  using namespace std; // Class to handle test scores class TestScores { private: int* scores; // Pointer to hold the array of test scores int size; // Size of the array public: // Constructor that accepts an array of test scores as a pointer TestScores(int* arr, int s) { size &#x3D; s; scores &#x3D; new int[size]; // Dynamically allocate memory for scores array // Copy elements from the passed array to the member array for (int i &#x3D; 0; i  100) { delete[] scores; // Free allocated memory before throwing an exception throw &quot;Invalid test score&quot;; } } } // Destructor to free dynamically allocated memory ~TestScores() { delete[] scores; } // Member function to calculate and return the average of the test scores double average() { double sum &#x3D; 0; for (int i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; size; i++) { sum +&#x3D; scores[i]; } return sum / size; } }; int main() { // Example array of test scores int arr[] &#x3D; { 90, 85, 95, 88, 92 }; try { // Creating an instance of TestScores class with the array pointer TestScores test(arr, sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0])); // Calculating and printing the average of the test scores cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Average score: &quot; &lt;&lt; test.average() &lt;&lt; endl; } catch (const char* e) { // Handling exception if any test score is invalid cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;Error: &quot; &lt;&lt; e &lt;&lt; endl; } return 0; }

 I really resent my my manager and I&#x27;m starting to resent the entire company. We&#x27;ve been pending a &quot;sale&quot; for two years now, hiring freezes, minimum merit increases across the board, etc. 
 My manager has become increasing erratic, even more of a micromanager, literally forgetting things we&#x27;ve spoken about during our 1:1&#x27;s and a week later changes his mind or tells me to do something completely different. He talks down to everyone else in the company to me. Overall he&#x27;s incredibly &quot;toxic&quot; to work for.
 I&#x27;m a hands-on manager myself and have hired my entire team. They&#x27;re all top performers and get &quot;above expectations&quot; on their reviews and are well respected in the company. They&#x27;re really the only reason I haven&#x27;t left yet.
 How would you navigate this situation? It&#x27;s really effecting my life outside work and when I &quot;clock out&quot; for the day - leave my office and walk into the rest of my home with my wife and children, I&#x27;m usually in a bad mood and can&#x27;t shake it.

                              <span>Overrated: 
 Microservices (yes, it&#x27;s me who created the recent thread about MSA). The thread has some insightful stories and arguments, but I still feel like the hype around microservices did the industry a bad favor. 
 MongoDB (closely related to the PG point below). I have several times heard my colleagues discuss MongoDB and want to use it at work. Every single time, my immediate reaction was to ask why and suggest using Postgres instead with its JSONB columns.
 Clean/hexagonal architecture - I think that the underlying ideas (dependency inversion, single responsibility and the rest of SOLID) are great ways to reason about architecture. That said, the marketing hype about clean architecture seems to have created a cult of religious fans to the point where abstractions and layers of indirection are created just because that follows what Uncle Bob wrote in his article. Also, the popular argument of &quot;now we can swap the database every day&quot; is so unrealistic in my opinion. I don&#x27;t really remember ever needing to unexpectedly swap a database. Maybe, I&#x27;m wrong. 
 Underrated: 
 Postgresql - even though it has a great reputation these days, I still think a lot of people would benefit a lot from knowing more about its features and potential. My personal favorite is using PG&#x27;s FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED feature to implement a simple queue. Whenever I need a task queue, I immediately reach for it. 
 Presentation/writing skills: I am not a great presenter and speaker myself, but the more I work as a software engineer, the more I realize that being concise, accurate, and engaging in your writing/speaking is a valuable asset. Not only does it make you more efficient in communication, your colleagues like you more, and your managers are likely to give you a promotion. 
 What are yours?

                              <span>Context: - I&#x27;m a Staff engineer at a well known tech company with a mature engineering org. 15 years in the industry. Well compensated, great product and team. Been there 3.5 years, was promoted once, and given lots of recognition and leadership.
  
I am going to retire either in 2 months or 8 months to be a stay at home parent. For financial reasons, I&#x27;d prefer the 8 months. More vesting, bonus payout, and savings. But 2 months is fine too. 
 
My manager is excellent. Best of my career. And also a decent guy who I&#x27;m relatively close with.
 
I&#x27;m the embodiment of the bus factor. I work on a critical team, am the only one with deep experience in the product and code, and it&#x27;s a pretty niche bit of technology. I haven&#x27;t preferred it be this way, but we&#x27;ve generally been understaffed and overworked on executive priorities since we were acquired. This is just to say, I know it&#x27;ll be hard on the team when I leave, and they&#x27;re going to try and get me to stay.
 
 My question:
 I&#x27;m considering letting my manager know that I&#x27;ll be leaving in X weeks (still not for sure when I&#x27;ll give notice), but that I&#x27;d be open to staying on for up to 8 months, under the condition that I work a lot less (say 10 hours/week) with the expectation that I&#x27;d help KTLO, stabilize the team and backfill my role. 
 But I won&#x27;t stay for 8 months without a deal like that, for various family and personal reasons. 
 I can imagine many reasons the org wouldn&#x27;t go for something like this. But I&#x27;m curious if you&#x27;ve heard of anything like it, and if so, if you have any tips for how I&#x27;d approach it.

                              <span>So we decided to use a split of our domain, persistence, and API layer (there, DTOs) in our application. Java in our case.
 It obviously has quite some overhead to it because we need to duplicate some structures that (currently) all match. We also need to create mappers.
 However, we see many advantages in that approach, so are generally quite happy:
  
We will never break API when the domain model changes (which can happen quite some time), although we of course need to change the API/DTOs proactively if the domain model changes
 Renaming some fields internally although the API wants a specific name is very easy and not a problem (there are also annotations for it but it&#x27;s not only the API layer that uses the data but also background jobs, and while for some stuff https Controllers are us…</span>

                              <span>Tried to confirm my offer salary and also negotiate. Recruiter has been extremely friendly and professional throughout my experience until now. Seems snarky (no longer addressing me in the email by name, or signing off the email, the tone) for a simple question and is making me question the company culture. I have another offer but it is research not swe or ai, so this role is preferable. 
 This would be my first internship at a tech company so idk. My experience has been solely research &amp; NASA.

                              <span>A few friends and I finished working on this project called lootcode, it&#x27;s a fantasy themed game that helps you practice data structures and algos. It was built for a projects program at a club at UCF and placed 1st, hoping you guys would try it out and give feedback.
 For all the problems Input comes from standard input and output should be printed to standard output. The source code is available, but since the problems are locked behind one another in regions within the site I wouldn&#x27;t want you to spoil anything for yourself so browse with caution. Enjoy :)

                              <span>Bit of a bait title since this question highly depends on what you consider prod ready. However, I would be interested in some stories of people using crossplane in production and how it compares to Terraform or similar.
 We are planning to build a internal developer platform for azure cloud and I would like to use crossplane because I like how it works with ArgoCD (GitOps). We plan to stick to the cnoe framework (cnoe.io).
 Any stories, pitfalls, limitations of people using it?

 Trying to decide between: 
 A - Write custom script that will ping these APIs occasionally and fire an alert 
 B - Use products that specialize in pinging external resources 
 Appreciate any thought on this matter and recommendations for relevant products

                              <span>For example, the app has elk which needs a cluster of computers, which isn’t possible in local computing. So integration is limited when devs on local. 
 So there’s a solution apparently, for devs to see much faster change than to wait for a ci to push and pull image for deployment, which can take 30 min. 
 I was in an interview for a company and he said they inject side cars in the pods and use headers manipulations from the staging servers. So that devs will see the change much faster. Than just wait for ci.

                              <span>Every other post here mentions how the job market is trash right now and that unemployment is currently at x% or y%. My question is, is there a way to quantify how many of those professionals are actually decent coders? Or, a more straightforward question would be how many don&#x27;t really know how to code?
 I worked as a tutor for 3 years in college and as a &quot;professor&quot; for 2 years in a bootcamp, and I can safely say that a good chunk of my students and classmates oversell themselves on LinkedIn and Resume by a huge margin. 
 They go from running a ML model from a repo to adding &quot;Successfully designed and implemented a Visual transformer model for semantic segmentation, obtaining 98% IoU score while training on a dataset with underrepresented classes&quot; on their resume. Like bro I know you don&#x27;t know what those words mean, I was literally trying to teach them to you yesterday.
 I don&#x27;t doubt that the market is bad compared to previous years, but I do wonder how much of that comes from people who just started trying to get jobs that demand more knowledge. That has to skew the unemployed rates in tech somehow.
 This is a legit question and I&#x27;d love to hear different or similar perspectives.

 I sent out maybe 100 application from late last year to about march and landed one interview, I gave up for a bit then started applying again 2 weeks ago.
 for the last week I sent out 5 applications and got 3 interviews, and have been getting pestered by recruiters on linked in again which has not happened in a few years.
 lucky or have yall been noticing the same thing? also noticing linked in applications no longer getting an insane amount of applicants per job..

My compensation is about ~$200k with a ~10% bonus, which seems fantastic and I would have never dreamed of even a few years ago, but the problem is you get used to it and then after a few years of working hard and not being rewarded more (my salary is pretty much at the top end and not gonna increase much according to my employer), the motivation to work hard starts to drop and you start to look for the next thing. The field I work in is computer vision so it&#x27;s somewhat niche and pays decent, although not super high end unless you do FAANG or more advanced deep learning. Anyway, the problem I&#x27;m facing right now is I don&#x27;t see a path forward really in terms of career growth. What I&#x27;ve noticed is pe…</span>

 Computer science is hotter than ever at U.S. universities. But students graduating this month are discovering their degrees are no longer a surefire ticket to tech-industry riches.
 In fact, many are finding it harder than they ever thought it would be to land a job.
 Tech giants that were expanding aggressively just a few years ago now have less need for entry-level hires-or are shedding jobs. They are also, increasingly, turning their focus to artificial intelligence, a technology many fear could reduce the need for coders. Postings on jobs website Indeed for software-development roles, a proxy for computer science, have dropped 30% from prepandemic levels.
 At the same time, companies have a burgeoning supply of new grads to choose from. The number of students in the U.S. majoring in computer and information science has jumped 40% in five years, to more than 600,000 as of 2023. The number of bachelor&#x27;s degrees conferred in those majors topped 100,000 in 2021, according to the Department of Education, a 140% rise from 10 years earlier.

                              <span>Decman is a declarative package &amp; configuration manager for Arch Linux. It allows you to manage installed packages, your dotfiles, enabled systemd units, and run commands automatically. Your system is configured using Python so your configuration can be very adaptive.
 Here is an example of a very simple configuration:
 import decman from decman import File, Directory # Declare installed packages decman.packages +&#x3D; [&quot;python&quot;, &quot;git&quot;, &quot;networkmanager&quot;, &quot;ufw&quot;, &quot;neovim&quot;] # Declare installed aur packages decman.aur_packages +&#x3D; [&quot;protonvpn&quot;] # Declare configuration files # Inline decman.files[&quot;/etc/vconsole.conf&quot;] &#x3D; File(content&#x3D;&quot;KEYMAP&#x3D;us&quot;) # From files within your repository decman.files[&quot;/etc/pacman.conf&quot;] &#x3D; File(source_file&#x3D;&quot;./dotfiles/pacman.conf&quot;) # Declare a whole directory decman.directories[&quot;/home/user/.config/nvim&quot;] &#x3D; Directory(source_directory&#x3D;&quot;./dotfiles/nvim&quot;, owner&#x3D;&quot;user&quot;) # Ensure that a systemd unit is enabled. decman.enabled_systemd_units +&#x3D; [&quot;NetworkManager.service&quot;] 
 I wanted to declaratively manage my Arch Linux installation, so I created decman. I&#x27;m sharing it here in case somebody else finds it useful.

 It&#x27;s just in my computer or the latest linux kernel broke a lot of things. In my case bluetooth stopped working (managed to solve it) ata3 returns a lot of exceptions and using linux-zen kernel returns a lot of cpu exceptions...
 Just me or anybody else is having this issues?

 (https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wdry0v/things\_to\_do\_after\_installing\_arch\_linux/). However, I wanted to make an independent post about it in case people missed out on this stuff or are new to arch.
  
When editing /etc/pacman.conf with nano, vim, or another text editor you can add the option &quot;ILoveCandy&quot; (no quotes) below the Misc options to get a custom progress bar during package installs. (You can also uncomment color and parallel downloads if you want.)
 Typing &quot;yes I use arch btw&quot; (no quotes) into the terminal and pressing enter will result in you being spammed by &quot;I use arch btw&quot; as output. (Obviously do Ctrl-C to stop)
  
Otherwise, make sure to tell everyone you use arch (btw) and make sure neofetch is installed.

                              <span>I heard codecademy was a good place, but after teaching me how to do hello world, it was pay blocked. I was pay blocked in only 5 minutes into the tutorial.
 codecademy was the place i heard about that was free. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a recent change or maybe python was never free. I got about 30 minutes into C++ but from the little that i worked on ren&#x27;py, i liked python more.
 So it leads back to my topic title, is there are place that teaches Python for free or at least 1 time payment. I want to take it at my own pace and fear subscription services.
 edit: saw another thread where this guy posted this link for python courses. $20 for learning python in 60 days. I&#x27;m seeing people say udemy is good. Would you guys recommend? a coupon code seems to be attached with the link already too. https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/?couponCode&#x3D;LEADERSALE24B
 I did try YT and search for people teaching python, but there&#x27;s so many people doing it, is there one specific channel / guide you guys would recommend if not taking an online course?
 EDIT AGAIN: So after spending a few hours trying out Python vs GDScript. I&#x27;m going to be going with GD script. I&#x27;m loving how it works just slightly better then Python, but both are good. What won me over was that I had already planned on using Gadot as the first game engine i would try. So it only made sense to use the language that is native to that engine. So thank you everyone for your suggestions, but I know what i want to do now.

 Should I prioritize learning the fundamentals through building projects instead? Or keep watching the YouTube videos about python?
 I&#x27;m a newbie btw in programming and python.

Some argue that CPUs lack threads and instead have only cores, and that threads are provided by the operating system. Is it true? Is there an upper limit to the number of threads that a CPU can run? What determines this factor?

                              <span>In the Debian repositories the tldr package Debian uses is actually a Haskell version of the original tldr (which is written in Python). The problem is, this Haskell version is outdated and just not good as the original. Does anyone know why? Why use a bad fork of a package if you can just use the original, which is objectively better?

I have to say that this is something I should&#x27;ve learned during my undergrad and I&#x27;m on this journey at the moment of relearning everything and unlearning a lot of bad habits and misunderstandings. One of this is writing code you actually understand holistically and not code that just does something and it works. I remember learning unit testing for Java in one module and it sucked a lot. Since then I just ignored testing all together.
 I want every line understood and every action and reaction accounted for, and so far on chapter 8, C gives me the ability to understand everything I do. It forces you to do you so, and I love it. My concern is as I progress through the book and lea…</span>

                              <span>ChatGPT thinks it is a good idea when i ask it. But what do real people think? Is error handling important in C? I come from Java and I never did that, I assume that the language does what it is supposed to do. Is that not the case with C? Why all these error flags all over the place?
 Here is an example where i just want to convert a string to a double. Chat GPT goes crazy with error checking. Should I ignore it even though ChatGPT loves it?
 #include  #include  #include  #include 
 #include  int main() { char str[] &#x3D; &quot;123.456&quot;; char *endptr; double num; errno &#x3D; 0; // Reset errno before call num &#x3D; strtod(str, &amp;endptr); if (endptr &#x3D;&#x3D; str) { printf(&quot;Conversion failed, no digits were found\n&quot;); } else if (errno &#x3D;&#x3D; ERANGE) { if (num &#x3D;&#x3D; HUGE_VAL) { printf(&quot;Overflow occurred\n&quot;); } else if (num &#x3D;&#x3D; 0) { printf(&quot;Underflow occurred\n&quot;); } } else { printf(&quot;The number is %f\n&quot;, num); } return 0; }

 Hello I&#x27;m implementing selection sort algorithm, but having bit of wired behavior in my program. If I don&#x27;t write the a printf statement for the size of the array at the end of the program, the last element in the sorted array doesn&#x27;t get printed out. Can anyone point out what I&#x27;m doing wrong here:
 int Arr[] &#x3D; {43, 56, 232, 11, 8, 900, 32, 67};
 int size &#x3D; sizeof(Arr)/sizeof(Arr[0]);
 for(int i&#x3D;0; i Arr[j])
 {
  &#x60;temp &#x3D; Arr[i];&#x60; &#x60;Arr[i] &#x3D; Arr[j];&#x60; &#x60;Arr[j] &#x3D; temp;&#x60; 
 } 
  &#x60;}&#x60; 
 }
 printf(&quot;\n Conditioned array:&quot;);
 for(int i&#x3D;0; i&lt;size; i++)
 {
 printf(&quot;\n%d&quot;, Arr[i]);
 };
 printf(&quot;\nSize: %d\n&quot;, size);

                              <span>Maybe something a little unique compared to the projects usually posted here, but I have been working on an anticheat for coming up to a year now. I think when people recommend C projects you always see the classic &quot;OS, compiler etc.&quot; recommendations and I think game hacking is a really cool niche that allows you to dive deep into cpu architecture and kernel mode programming. You&#x27;d be surprised at some of the advanced cheats that exist nowadays and modern anticheats such as vanguard truly are an engineering marvel. 
 Due to the nature of anti-cheats there really isnt a guide out there to follow so I&#x27;ve pretty much designed it entirely by myself. Any feedback would be appreciated :)

                              <span>Hello!
 After a long break, I&#x27;ve felt like writing C again. I came up with the little program below and would like some help in gauging just how rusty I have become. Any comments or tips will be appreciated.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;c
 include 
 include 
 typedef struct { int val; const char* name; } Foo;
 int main() { Foo* foos &#x3D; (Foo*) malloc(3 * sizeof (Foo));
 Foo f1 &#x3D; {.val &#x3D; 10, .name &#x3D; &quot;First&quot;}; Foo f2 &#x3D; {.val &#x3D; 20, .name &#x3D; &quot;Second&quot;}; Foo f3 &#x3D; {.val &#x3D; 30, .name &#x3D; &quot;Third&quot;}; foos[0] &#x3D; f1; foos[1] &#x3D; f2; foos[2] &#x3D; f3; for (size_t i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) { printf(&quot;%s [%d]\n&quot;, foos[i].name, foos[i].val); } free(foos); 
 } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 P.S. I&#x27;m not sure a valgrind-related question would be considered off-topic. If not, could anyone help me understand why it reports 2 allocs and 2 frees for the code above? I would expect 1 and 1. 3 crossed my mind, even. But why 2?
 Thank you.

                              <span>The code below uses the following struct:
 struct Data {
 struct Data *data1;
 int data2;
 int *data3;
 };
 typedef struct Data Data;
 In the code below, declarations for d1, d2, and d3 are missing. (Recall that a variable declaration gives the type and tells the compiler about a variable; e.g., int n; would declare the variable n.) Each of d1 and d2 have one of the following types: Data, Data*, and/or Data **.First, write three lines of code declaring variables d1, d2, and d3. Then, draw a memory diagram, including clearly differentiating between the stack and the heap, forthe snippet of code shown below.
 I think the answer for this one above is 
 Data d1;
 Data* d2;
 int** d3;
 Draw memory diagram for code below:
 d1.data2 &#x3D; 10;
 d2 &#x3D; malloc(sizeof(Data));
 (*d2).data1 &#x3D; &amp;d1;
 d2-&gt;data2 &#x3D; d1.data2;
 d1.data1 &#x3D; d2;
 d1.data3 &#x3D; malloc(sizeof(int));
 *(d1.data3) &#x3D; 7;
 d2-&gt;data3 &#x3D; d1.data3;
 d3 &#x3D; &amp;(d2-&gt;data3);
 Could someone please help or explain how I would draw this diagram please?

                              <span>I was hired to compose a soundtrack around 2021-2022. I was paid up front, and the lead developer gave me a lot of freedom, only wanting a check-in every month or when I otherwise required their input.
 Ever since I completed the work, communication has been infrequent. I&#x27;ve moved on to other projects, but reach out for a chat once in a while and to receive an update regarding progress, since I tend to align music releases with a client&#x27;s marketing schedule to increase visibility.
 It&#x27;s been a year since the developer has answered my messages or emails, and it has been even longer since they engaged with their community (which somehow keeps growing to this day despite their absence, people joining to ask about the status of the game). Without going into detail, I have some idea why the dev…</span>

                              <span>Hey fellow devs,
 I&#x27;m really curious about the whole prototyping process in game development. What&#x27;s the stuff that drives you crazy when you&#x27;re trying to bring a game idea to life by creating its most basic idea?
  
How long does it take you to whip up a decent prototype?
 What&#x27;s the most annoying part of the process?
 Got any tricks or tools that make it easier?
 Any major pain points that make you think, &quot;There has to be a better way&quot;?
  
Just looking to chat and see what everyone else is dealing with.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been working with the Laravel framework and I&#x27;m quite familiar with its job queue system, specifically using database jobs and failed_jobs tables for managing asynchronous tasks.
 Recently, I&#x27;ve started a project in Go and I need to implement a job queue system. I&#x27;m wondering:
  
What are the best practices for creating job queues in Go?
 Are there any libraries or frameworks that follow a similar approach to Laravel&#x27;s job queues, particularly using database tables for jobs and failed jobs?
 How do error handling and retry mechanisms work in Go job queues compared to Laravel?
  
Any advice, examples, or resources would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I was tasked to research on Sandworm Vulnerability. So I managed to exploit the vulnerability after hours of setup on group assignment. After my groupmate and I figured out how to exploit Windows 8 using this vulnerability, I did some side quest with my Windows 8 VM. I played around with the VM using Metasploit on the meterpreter session to the point that it shutdown with RPC procedure failing. Then the whole Windows 8 machine went BSOD. I&#x27;m glad I learn something new

                              <span>Hey Rustaceans!
 I’m thrilled to announce the launch of my first Rust project - genson-rs! This lightning-fast JSON schema inference engine can generate schemas from gigabytes of JSON data in mere seconds. ⚡️
 Why genson-rs?
  
Speed: Handles huge JSON datasets in a flash.
 Efficiency: Optimized for performance and minimal resource usage.
 Rust-Powered: Leverages Rust’s safety and concurrency features.
  
I’d love to hear your thoughts! Your feedback and issues are greatly appreciated. 🙌
 Check it out here: https://github.com/junyu-w/genson-rs
 Happy coding!

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m a first-time emu-developer. I started with a Chip-8 emulator, following the Tobias V. Langhoff tutorial.
 I&#x27;m coding in C, because I already knew the language, but I didn&#x27;t use it since 2010... So it&#x27;s a good refresh ;)
 Anyway, I have some questions about non defined cases... What I mean: what should the emulator behavoiur be in those cases?
  
A wrong opcode is found. Should the emulator just ignore it and increment (by 2) the PC?
 The PC is greater than 4096 (CP overflow). Just ignore the higher bits and limit the counter to 12 bits?
 The SP is greater than 16 (stack overflow). The same way, ignoring the higher bits and limit SP to 4 bits?
  
Thank you for your help! :D

                              <span>I&#x27;m Developing a Chip8 Emulator using C &amp; SDL2
 I have got optimal results for test 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4 for the tests provided here, I seem to face issue in menu selection in test 5.
  
Firstly, I am able to press keys (key presses and release are being logged) but the emulator doesn&#x27;t respond to my key presses. I have looked at the opcode for key press many times I can&#x27;t seem to find the problem.
 Secondly, after rendering there should be a blinking box at the left of the emulator screen like this, but I get a static box at top of my Superchip &#x27;p&#x27;.
  
My Emulator Screenshot 
 Here is my Code CHIP8.C &amp; Here is my log file, Any Help would be really appreciated.

                              <span>I just started writing a RISC V emulator for the base rv32i ISA and was wondering how to implement printing? I see that the eCall instruction can be used for system calls. Is there a standard system call implementation for printing? Because my goal is to compile rust to RISC V asm and run it on my emulator.
 While I&#x27;m able to compile small test snippets and run them by hard coding the machine code in the emulator, I don&#x27;t know how to get printing working.
 Should I pick a random number for the syscall ID and write a function that relies on that syscall to print?
 Also, is there a way to only implement a tiny part of std? So, that I can use the print! Macro? Or is there an existing RISC V implementation of std that requires specific implementation-details that I can write my emulator around?

                              <span>I hope we also get the additional methods
 getFirstOrElse getLastOrElse
 at some point, similar to some of the other APIs for setting default values.
 EDIT: To clarify, since getFirst and getLast throw an exception if the collection is empty, it would be nice if the API had a build in way for recovering. It&#x27;s obviously straight forward to so by an if-test, but I&#x27;d favor a getFirstOrElse. My experience after using the API is that I quite often end up with something like:
 var firstOrDefault &#x3D; l.isEmpty() ? defaultValue : l.getFirst();
 and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that. But it feels like this could also have been built into the API. E.g.
 var firstOrDefault &#x3D; l.getFirstOrElse(defaultValue);

 I have NO SIDE PROJECTS, still managed to get offers from FAANG, why? probably because my muscles are quite big because instead of sitting at home after work I go to the gym or grab a beer. This is serious, people treat you with more respect when you have bigger muscles.
 Maybe invest some time in yourself instead of your resume guys.

                              <span>&quot;I want to emphasize that I see great potential in both your background and experience. However, I couldn&#x27;t help but feel that these qualities weren&#x27;t fully reflected in your resume from a hiring manager&#x27;s perspective. My suggestion would be to take a little step back and revisit your application with fresh eyes. Ensure that your narrative is clear and that all essential information is presented in a compelling way&quot;.
 Does she mean that the content itself is weak or it could be presented in a better way (I have mailed her and awaiting her response)? In the meanwhile, what do you guys think?

                              <span>I recently joined a midsize company - a Scala shop - as an Sr Infrastructure Engineer. My team consists of a principal engineer and rest of 4 Sr engineers. The principal engineer is originally a scala Dev with the company for over 10 years and hardly ever delegates stuff to application teams. So i have been fighting with databases and scala things for last two months. Don’t get me wrong, i am always up for learning new tech - I learned Go and wrote tf providers and k8s operators at my previous places and was a python/c++ dev for 5 years before that but i don’t get/like scala at all - and the codebase is highly opinionated. 
 I also think that because of the principle engineer, we end up taking so much application development work that should be delegated to the application teams.
 Anyways, i am very frustrated and don’t really see the way out except finding a new job.
 Rant over!

                              <span>Recently I was assigned into a DevOps position in a startup and i&#x27;m pretty shocked at the prices. I haven&#x27;t really spun a VM for maybe 5 years (mostly AWS and Digital Ocean 5$ learning projects) and the prices i&#x27;m seeing in Azure for what (seemingly) are entry level computes are shocking:
  
 Instance Type Series vCPUs Memory (GB) Max Data Disks Temp Storage (GB) IOPS Ephemeral OS Disk Monthly Cost 
  
 B2s General Purpose 2 4 4 8 (SCSI) 1280 Supported $34.46 
  B2ms General Purpose 2 8 4 16 (SCSI) 1920 Supported $68.91 
 
 I can get no quotas for free tier eligible (lol) VMs in my area and these are the least expensive ones! Back in 2019 I recall seeing computes like this going for single digits on AWS so I wonder if thats just the AI rush making hardware expensive, covid19, end of 0% interest rates or something else.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Wondering if anybody has experience with self-hosted alert management systems like PagerDuty? The specific features I&#x27;m looking for:
 - Centralised Alerts - SPOG for all alerts from all systems so these can be reviewed as part of a process
 - Assignable alerts - e.g. Server 1 is down has been assigned to Engineer 1
 - Basic escalation - nothing too fancy, if something hasn&#x27;t been assigned or hasn&#x27;t been resolved in X amount of time then do X action
 - OSS would be looovely
 Anybody know of any such system? 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hey there!
 A while ago I posted a question in this subreddit with the aim to better understand how people end up choosing a career in DevOps. I had the feeling that my personal experience of simply &quot;falling into the field&quot; surely couldn&#x27;t just be exclusive to me. It turns out thats the story for many others.
 I wrote a blog post exploring what direction I think DevOps is going in and what kind of DevOps engineers will be needed.
 Just as a disclaimer I&#x27;d like to point out this this is just a subjective opinion piece, just me trying to figure out the field I fell into. Cheers.

                              <span>Hello! I have been learning C++ for a bit and while I believe I understand the fundamentals fairly well, I am unsure what is the “next step” in learning. Looking around at projects to do it says things like building banking manager, hotel manager, inventory etc, however in order to do that and have some GUI, should I be using things like Qt? Or make it all in console? And with that I hear Qt uses its own framework which is not pure C++ so I am a little confused at when I should start using other frameworks

                              <span>Hi , I have a CMakeLists in a vendor/ folder , that&#x27;s supposed to build some dependencies , I want to know how to build some components of a library using find_package() , but if the component doesn&#x27;t exist , I just build it from the git submodule in the folder.
 Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m interested in program_options , but it isn&#x27;t installed , while some other boost libs are : 
 function(BUILD_BOOST_PO) add_subdirectory(boost) set( setup paths for po inc and libs here) endfunction() find_package(Boost COMPONENTS program_options) if(NOT Boost_FOUND) build_boost_po() endif() 
 The problem when I do this , even though Boost_FOUND evaluates to false , I still have a name collision between the system library , and the one in the sources : 
 CMake Error at vendor/boost/libs/headers/CMakeLists.txt:11 (add_library): add_library cannot create ALIAS target &quot;Boost::headers&quot; because another target with the same name already exists. 
 I do not have this problem without find_package.
 You think I should just ditch trying to find system libraries and just prefer using only the libraries in my vendor folder , or ditch both , and use fetch ?

We are tasked with making a GUI in Qt using the design studio but never actually got classes on how Qt works. I&#x27;m left incredibly confused as I don&#x27;t know how to make buttons do the things and i want for example, let alone load in and display a game-board. Is anyone able to help me with something like this?

                              <span>I’m going over my concurrency notes, and I understand the technical difference between std::future and std::shared_future, in that multiple threads can see the result of one particular future by copying it….
 But something about it seems unclear. I get that using the regular future would throw the exception that the future is invalid if multiple threads try to access it’s result, but as I’m still a beginner, I just don’t have a good program example of where someone would use it. Can any experienced programmers tell me a bit about where you might implement std::shared_future in your program? Like why you would use it? especially since cppreference says that access to the same shared state from multiple threads is safe if each thread does it “through its own copy” of a shared_future object (keyword copy sounds like something a program shouldn’t do)

                              <span>I learned about the C++ metaprogramming and expression template stuff a few years ago but never really looked deeper into it.
 Now I tried to understand how all this really works by writing a Tensor class using as much of the metaprogramming stuff as possible while still retaining something usefull.
 This Tensor class got worse and worse with every hour I put into crafting it and now I have to say it is enough.
 It now supports a huge amount of features and still is only one single header file.
 The most notable are:
  
Subtensors
  
And you don&#x27;t even have to fear huge performance problems because the class is written in a way that lets the compiler completely skip all instantiation overhead.
 Tensor t; Tensor t2 &#x3D; t[1]; 
  
Expression templates
  
​
 auto expr &#x3D; t + 2 * t + 3; t.set(expr); 
 For what it&#x27;s worth it took me way too long to create this.
 I also think that the code can maybe be written a little clearer and nicer in general.
 Maybe someone of you has useful input or feedback for me 😊
 Here the full code: tensor.hpp

 I was wondering if you can make something like the word “dot,” when written, carry out one or multiple predetermined lines, and how I could make that happen.
 I don’t know if this qualifies as a question for this subreddit, so if it’s not, my apologies.

                              <span>I read up on SIMD-ifying common string algorithms, e.g. strlen(), strcmp() and the like, and while it&#x27;s clear how they fundamentally work, there&#x27;s almost no mention of the problem with out-of-bounds data reads.
 How can _mm_loadu_si128(ptr) be correct if there are only two characters pointed to by ptr? What if the terminating zero we&#x27;re looking for is right at the page border?
 It is general knowledge that some standard libraries have (1) heavily optimized implementations for some of these, and (2) their implementations are &quot;trusted&quot; by the compiler to be correct, unlike common user code - but &quot;safely&quot; reading arbitrary memory seems to be outside of the compiler&#x27;s jurisdiction.
 If anybody has had more experience, I&#x27;d like to hear how you&#x27;ve handled this - or on what grounds you haven&#x27;t.

Currently i&#x27;m trying to finish my client application that connects to microcontrollers through the Internet and forwards data from them to some local ports on the computer.
 Now I have a problem with particular class design and I have many ideas how it can be solved - generally there are a few classes that must use the same resource but can only perform some operations on it.
 So let&#x27;s say I have a vector of objects (representing connection between microcontroller and local port) and other variables that keep track of number of opened connections ect. Now there are a few classes that manage/observe this connections:

                              <span>Hello,
 I used to have a strong capability for solving algorithmic problems using C++, but I haven&#x27;t practiced for a year as I have been working more with Python on ML topics. Starting in September, I will be pursuing a CS MSc. I&#x27;m no longer interested in the Data Science path, but rather in software development, particularly algorithms (this was the most stimulating part of my bachelor&#x27;s education) or trading (I had a Finance minor). I want to regain my proficiency.
 Currently, I&#x27;m reading &quot;C++ Crash Course: A Fast-Paced Introduction&quot; to refresh my knowledge while also studying introductory material about derivatives. After that, I plan to dive into Leetcode and &quot;Cracking the Coding Interview.&quot; I also have &quot;Algorithmic Trading&quot; by Ernest Chan in mind for when I get back to a good level of coding.
 However, I keep wondering: how deeply should I delve into C++, especially regarding the new versions? Do you have any tips or reading material you think I should check out to achieve my goals? I would be grateful for any help.

                              <span>Hello, I have a project where I am using almost every type of thermocouple probe connected to a micro controller. If you don&#x27;t know how thermocouples work, essentially it&#x27;s a simple device of 2 wires being welded together, and at specific temperatures they output a known voltage. 
 This is commonly used for temperature measurement, as you can measure the voltage to get temperature (simplified). In order to know the temperature based off of the voltage you must have the table that corresponds the voltage and temperature. Since this table is just temperature to voltage, its 2 columns. However the tables sometimes have 1500+ rows.To add to the pain, I haven&#x27;t been able to find a text file of these tables, only PDF formats. 
 What would be the fastest way to implement these tables into memory and search through one column of data to find the corresponding data point. I was thinking a 2D array using binary search (since the tables are already sorted).

                              <span>Hello. So I recently recreated the pong game as my own little project using C++ and SFML. I “finished” it and realized I wanted to have a main menu, and game over screen. Well this led me down this whole rabbit hole of changing my entire game into a class. And doing it that way. Which is probably the best way to do it. But I found that I am still struggling with the whole class concept. Do yall know any websites or videos or something that could help me get better with classes? Thank!

 Do you guys think I should put in more effort and focus into c++ or I should just chill till I’m done with my course.
 I need an advice please

Now with the layoffs, reorgs, unclear goals, increased politics, subpar leadership, etc, it seems like this may no longer be the case- at least on blind. 
 But blind is also known to have higher proportion of ungrateful people, so I would like to fact check this against the general community: how would people view Google SWE on the resu me now? Are there a new generation of companies (like OpenAI, Anthropic etc) outdoing Google on all fronts? What’s the future of Google?

                              <span>I work full in office even though everything I do is already done via teams or email anyways, but I don&#x27;t work &quot;9-5&quot; more &quot;8-5&quot; as I don&#x27;t get an hour paid lunch, and since I&#x27;m fully in office I have to sit at the desk all day. I can take an occasional break to go to the bathroom or maybe a nice brisk walk but if my breaks are consistently longer then 20-30mins, or I take multiple (2 or more) a day, people get suspicious.
 I&#x27;m wondering what y&#x27;alls work environments are like? Do you have the &quot;hour paid lunch&quot; amd work a &quot;9-5&quot; and do you work remote? If you work remote do you sit at your desk at home for the entire time you&#x27;re working? If you need to do a quick 30 minute errand/whatever causes to be away from your desk for an extended period of time do you &quot;clock-out&quot;/work the extra 30 mins, or however long you were out, take vacation, or not do anything? 
 Or do yall work like 4 hours a day and claim you&#x27;re working 8 hours and just do whatever else whenever you can?

 They didn’t walk at their 2020 high school graduations. They entered college at the height of remote learning and campus lockdowns. And now they’re finishing exams amid nationwide protests and preparing to enter a job market that’s hard for many to navigate.
 Coming up to the podium — the class of 2024.
 Tainted by the pandemic, this outgoing class of seniors had anything but a typical college experience. Most are ready to enter the “real world.” Yet the class is — again — needing to adjust their expectations. Even the best of students are facing an endless web of job applications, ambiguous timelines and countless rejections.

                              <span>So I am now on a team that has a lot of people from India. Both literally they are located in India, or they were born in India but located in the USA now.
 Not everyone is from India on my team though. But I would say its around 50%.
 It is obvious there are some differences in culture going on. Not major, but I can tell in subtle ways.
 The company I working for is located in the US and is US headquartered. The CEO and higher ups are not Indian. Middle management is a mix of Indian and non Indian. Workers as well. But its a large enough number that this is a thing.
 For those from Indian backgrounds or have experience working with those from that background, what is the best way to get along at work? Especially if you are not Indian? 
 I&#x27;m not making any judgments against Indian workforce when I ask this. I would just rather ask now to avoid conflicts or cultural conflicts in the future because I was not aware of them.
 Thanks if anyone can provide information.

                              <span>I lost my job about a year ago due to the big tech layoffs, and it&#x27;s caused me to go through the most difficult year of my life. I&#x27;ve been applying to jobs ever since I&#x27;d gotten laid off, and idk what it&#x27;s been like in other countries, but here in the US, it&#x27;s been hard, to say the least. At least, in my experience. But I&#x27;ve finally landed a gig about 2 months ago!
 I should be happy. I should be excited. But all I feel is fear. I&#x27;m afraid that if I don&#x27;t live up to unsaid expectations, I&#x27;m going to lose my job (get replaced, laid off, fired, etc.). I&#x27;m afraid that if I&#x27;m not able to finish tickets within a day, I&#x27;m going to lose my job. I&#x27;m afraid that if I don&#x27;t actively contribute at every meeting, I&#x27;m going to lose my job. It feels like, for every reason I can find for me being able to keep my job, I find 3-4 other reasons why I&#x27;m more likely to lose it.
 Ever since I&#x27;d gotten hired, it&#x27;s felt like I&#x27;ve been walking on a thin string that can snap at any moment, at which point I&#x27;d fall to my death. I&#x27;m so scared that my happiness - my life - is at the fingertips of a higher-up at a company and that, at the snap of their finger, I can end up back in the same place I was for the past year.

                              <span>Alright, well, guess we&#x27;re back at it again bois. No-job life baby 😎
 Okay, all jokes aside, I&#x27;m actually still flabbergasted from all of this. Long story short, I was working at a startup until last Friday, when my boss and I suddenly had a one-on-one call over Zoom. The conversation was basically about me having to be more &quot;responsible&quot; in my job. In other words, reply to messages on the weekends, work overtime (with no pay), etc. In a nutshell, I apologized, politely said no, and that I was going to work strictly within the hours I&#x27;m meant to: 9 to 5. I was pretty much fired on the spot shortly after that.
 You see, ever since I&#x27;d gotten hired, I&#x27;d made my boundaries very clear and never failed to set them up. Once 5pm hits, I&#x27;m out. Nobody can contact me for work-related reasons. I don&#x27;t care if something is broken or whatever, I&#x27;m not fixing it until the next day or the following Monday (if it&#x27;s a Friday). Unless you communicate to me that you&#x27;re going to pay me overtime, I&#x27;m out. I have things to do in my private life, like taking care of family and simply hunkering down so that I have the energy to get back at it the next day.
 I think that boundaries are very important, especially if they ultimately help you to love your job more and to be able to have good mental health. To expect and to demand from employees, especially to their face, that they&#x27;re meant to sacrifice their life for the company they&#x27;re working for is a huge red flag in my book. It really sucks to not have a job anymore, as the market is complete doodoo, but it is what it is.

                              <span>Having read a few books on microservices and having worked with them (or rather a bad attempt) for a while, I personally still don&#x27;t see any obvious cases when it&#x27;s a clear winner over modular monoliths. 
 I mean, yes, independent deployability and scalability is cool. It&#x27;s also a well-known statement that microservices is an organisational pattern, not a technical one. And still it&#x27;s not really clear how the disadvantages such as losing transactional guarantees and lack of network communication over the network are justified. 
 It&#x27;s not even always clear at the beginning of a project whether we need those independent scaling. 
 What is your take on microservices? If you have a story of using them successfully and being happy with the experience, please share the circumstances that in your opinion made it successful. .

                              <span>It seems slightly counter-intuitive that moving slower would increase fatigue, but that is what is happening. I recently switched teams and the build process on the team I joined is much more complex and slower, and my capacity to focus on work is tanking.
 I think I&#x27;ve heard about studies have data to back up this phenomenon, but my search attempts haven&#x27;t surfaced those studies. I&#x27;d appreciate if anyone here can help me out.
 I&#x27;d love to share anytime on the subject with my new team and leadership to show the opportunity cost of the current process. Thanks!

                              <span>Where I work, there&#x27;s an abstraction for everything. Microfrontend architecture? Theres a team who makes a wrapper that you have to consume for some reason that abstracts the build process away from you. Devops? Same thing. Spring boot? Same thing. Database? Believe it or not, same thing. 
 Nothing works, every team is &quot;about to release a bugfix for that&quot;, my team gets blamed for being slow. How do you deal with this?
 Tech managers shouldn&#x27;t be surprised they can&#x27;t find candidates with good hard skills with an industry littered with junk like this.
 I&#x27;m not saying I want to sit here flipping bits manually, but this seems to have gone too far in the opposite direction.

                              <span>Just wanted to know if any of you leads/managers have been put in a position to manage people you dont get along with 
 You can always keep things professional but at some point having to manage people you dont get along and only put on a facade can get in the way of your own motivation on the team
 I can see a potential fix would be to request to change team (you or the persons you dont get along with), but this is not always something you can actually do right?
 And not even thinking on searching for excuses to fire them because you might burn yourself by doing so if not enough reasons to do it, or you are still thinking on moving elsewhere so why impact other peoples lives over your short term benefits, right ?
 Asking because a friend came to me with his problems and I couldn’t answer his questions.

                              <span>Some of you may have come across Helix - a very fast editor/IDE (which is completely written in Rust, thus the relevance to this community!). Unfortunately, Helix has its own set of keybindings, modeled after Kakoune.
 This was the one problem holding me back from using this excellent editor, so I soft-forked the project to add Vim keybindings. Now, two years later, I realize this might interest others as well, so here we go:
 https://github.com/usagi-flow/evil-helix
 I‘d be happy to polish the fork - which I carefully keep up-to-date with Helix‘s master branch for now. So let me know what you think!
 And yes, I‘m also looking for a more original name.

                              <span>Numberphile asked a question on Twitter and their blog (now both deleted) if anyone could help determine which five tetrahedral numbers will sum to 343867. I solved it quickly with 5 nested loops which helped him I think, although I don&#x27;t think he anticipated that there were no less than 277 different working combinations, ha!
 I also made a much shorter program in Python based on itertools.combinations but it was excruciatingly slow. So I wanted to make a similar function in C, and I did. Successive calls to the function return a pointer to an array of K distinct numbers, each time the next combination in lexicographical order of an &quot;N take K&quot; set. The last call, or a call with invalid arguments, frees the memory used by the function internally.
 I implemented Donald Knuth&#x27;s algorithm from his book The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4A, §7.2.1.3, algorithm T, page 359. The only thing is that his lexicographical order goes from highest to lowest number, while we usually want to process the array in ascending order, so it&#x27;s only really ordered if you reverse it. That is different from the Python version and the nested loops version. Ah well.
 Let me know what you think! Version 0.0.1: https://github.com/ednl/c/blob/master/combinations.c
 A tiny test program: https://github.com/ednl/c/blob/master/combinations-test.c and my solution for Numberphile: https://github.com/ednl/c/blob/master/tetrasum.c

I always assumed that only the functions that were used were put in the final executable, but after trying to make a statically linked hello world (only standard library function I used was printf()), the size of my binary went from a few KBs to almost an entire MB. I&#x27;m sure printf() could contain a lot more code than I think it does, but surely not an entire megabyte worth of code?

                              <span>I try to implement the huffman code in C, for that I have to write individual bits to a file. My idea is to send them to a function that buffers the bits until one byte is filled and then to return it. I made a working function but it couldn&#x27;t handle input up to 256 bits which is necessary for my use case, so I started again but used arrays of chars as input and output. It would be great if someone could read the code and help me. (The commented part of the function is the old function that I use as a reference)
 bitsHandler.c: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; // Buffers bits until byte is filled. Return code is length of output array
 include 
 int bitsBuffer(unsigned char* input, unsigned char nBits, unsigned char* output) { int i; // Number of elements in input array char inputLength &#x3D; (nBits + 7) / 8 - 1;…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m recently got introduced to the world of emulation and got recommended a CHIP-8 Emulator for my first project related to emulation.
 Everything was fine and I thought I nailed the project when I was able to render an IBM Logo and an Octojam 2 Title, feeling confident I completed the leftover opcode.
 After Completing All opcodes I tried to running Tetris &amp; some other games, but it didn&#x27;t seem to run as expected, the blocks are stuck in one place not able to move.I think its a problem related to looping or somewhere I must have incremented or not incremented the PC, but I can&#x27;t seem to fix it
 It would be really helpful if any assistance is provided

                              <span>I know there&#x27;s this function Beep() from the winapi and I&#x27;m searching for something similar. Here&#x27;s what I found so far: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;c void beep(int frequency, int duration) { int console_fd; console_fd &#x3D; open(&quot;/dev/console&quot;, O_WRONLY); if (console_fd &#x3D;&#x3D; -1) { perror(&quot;Error opening /dev/console&quot;); return; }
 // Start the beep sound if (ioctl(console_fd, KIOCSOUND, (int)(1193180 / frequency)) &#x3D;&#x3D; -1) { perror(&quot;Error using ioctl to start sound&quot;); close(console_fd); return; } // Sleep for the duration of the beep usleep(duration * 1000); // Stop the beep sound if (ioctl(console_fd, KIOCSOUND, 0) &#x3D;&#x3D; -1) { perror(&quot;Error using ioctl to stop sound&quot;); } close(console_fd); 
 } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; but that requires root permissions to work. Is there a way that doesn&#x27;t require root (and posibbly using the current sound output like headphones or monitor? I don&#x27;t reall care about this but would be cool)

                              <span>I wasn&#x27;t able to find a straight answer if struct have or haven&#x27;t any default values, by default. Like, 0 for int and NULL for pointers.
 So for this code:
 // void pointers as generic Items typedef void *Item; typedef const void *constItem; typedef struct tnode *Tree; typedef const struct tnode *constTree; typedef struct tnode { Item value; Tree sub[2]; } Treenode; typedef enum {left, right} Child; 
 And this in the main function:
 int main() { Tree wtree; // It&#x27;s a pointer to a struct not a struct wtree-&gt;value &#x3D; NULL; wtree-&gt;sub[left] &#x3D; wtree-&gt;sub[right] &#x3D; NULL; return 0; } 
 Is it necessary to initiate this way for this example where NULL is the initial value? Is this the best way to initiate a structure with a pointer to it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m in the process of attempting to write a dynamic table of data for an array of structs. The general layout of the primary data structure is thus:
 struct global_data{ float *data; struct data *table; size_t size_data; size_t size_table; }; 
 where data is a table of single precision values, table is a dynamic table structure, and size_data denotes the size of the data, and size_table denotes the number of struct data structs.
 The implementation of struct data is:
 struct data{ float *data[COL]; }; 
 Each data struct will represent a specific matrix of data.
 The goal is to have a dynamic table of data to work with and pass around a specific part of some data processing program; the idea is to not have to call malloc k-times and have a fragmented heap.
 What goes on is the following:
 1) Input the number of unique matrices
 2) Allocate all relevant data : *table by way of number of matrices; *data for the total number of matrix elements
 3) Link *data from struct data to specific segment of *data found in struct global_data.
 This is based on the current implementation. The next implementation is to have the *data field within struct data to be dynamic: based on some k-dimensional array or arbitrary size, as determined by the user input, rather than predefined by the const definition of COL.
 The idea is to alias specific regions of some single-allocated table to pointers within another data structure, who determines the size of its own data to work with.
 What would you recommend I do to best approach this? The main issue I seem to have is the next implementation may need to account fro k-deep for loops for k-dimensional data structures. That may not be realistic. Another way is to perform algebra on the aliased pointers to access specific regions, but I&#x27;m not sure if that is the best way of approaching this problem due to the issue of readability and the increased risk of segmentation faults.

                              <span>I have had this idea for a while but can&#x27;t seem to break through with it. You can see in the image that there&#x27;s a question involving HCF. What I want to do is just print the factors. How do I achieve this? I don&#x27;t need a full tutorial, just a small hint. The biggest obstacle for me right now is figuring out how to get a number that changes according to the input number. For instance, in the image, you can see:
 2 | 20
 2 | 10
 5 | 5
 | 1
 How do I get five in the program? Should I use a for loop? I am a beginner, so can someone please enlighten me? If possible, just give a small hint. I want to solve this problem by myself. This is not an assignment; I am just teaching myself for now. My classes will start in August.

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;m trying to create some sort of poor man&#x27;s mmap() on a platform that does not support generic mmap directly (we&#x27;re talking about esp32s3). I realize that this approach will have a significant impact on performance, but nevertheless I would like to give it a try in specific places in the project. The idea is to generate code around each memory load, check the pointer value and decide if the load should happen from other address.
 Pseudocode illustrating the idea:
 char * mapped_file; read(somefile, mapped_file, file_size); char load_hook(void * ptr) { if(ptr &amp; 0xff000000) { return mapped_file[ptr &amp; 0x00ffffff]; } else { return *ptr; } } char s[] &#x3D; &quot;some data&quot;; char * p &#x3D; 0xff000002; char load_1 &#x3D; *s; char load_2 &#x3D; *p; // load_1 will contain first byte in s[], // load_2 will contain th…</span>

                              <span>Hello and apologies for the beginner question but I&#x27;m unable to compile some code I wrote using a third-party library I downloaded and there are no resources on StackOverflow or other forums explaining what&#x27;s wrong.
 I&#x27;m using the pdfio library and I&#x27;ve installed it according to the instructions on its website. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a third-party library. Here is my code (just trying it out):
 #include 
 #include 
 int main() { pdfio_file_t *pdf &#x3D; pdfioFileOpen(&quot;MyFile.pdf&quot;, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL); pdfioFileClose(pdf); } 
 And then below is the printout from the terminal:
 cc readpdf.c -o readpdf
 Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  &quot;_pdfioFileClose&quot;, referenced from:
 _main in readpdf-a9fd1b.o
  &quot;_pdfioFileOpen&quot;, referenced from:
 _main in readpdf-a9fd1b.o
 ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
 make: *** [readpdf] Error 1
 I&#x27;ve tried to link the library to the source code using commands like
 make readpdf -o \usr\local\include\pdfio.h\
 But these attempts have been fruitless. Any clue as to what I&#x27;m doing wrong?

                              <span>I am not an expert in this field but upon searching &quot;a few times&quot; on google about &quot;linux malware development&quot; it&#x27;s mostly about courses and some github repos. Unlike Windows, you can already see guides, blog posts, courses like MalDev academy, and so on. Pretty much there&#x27;s a resource for developing malware on Windows. Instructions on how to use the Windows API. Reverse Engineering existing malwares (you can do the same for linux too). Hiding shellcodes from EDRs. Process injection. Loading share libraries. Etc. 
 I&#x27;m pretty sure developing malware for linux is not much harder than windows. So, why people barely talk about it compared to windows?
 ​
 Is this because of windows dominating the marketshare being the prime target for malware developers? Or maybe I just didn&#x27;t search enough.
 ​
 I&#x27;d like to hear your thoughts.

                              <span>Basically it just forces a constant time to load the next chunk. But how can we confidently say that this time is enough on lower-end machines? Because with a traditional loading screen, better computers will get through it faster, worse will get through it slower.

                              <span>Hello,
 My team and I are about to release our game Duck Detective on this Thursday 23rd May, and I wanted to share with you all the process of announcing to releasing a game in a 6 month time period
 This is me procrastinating from doing real work because I’m nervous 🥲
 The TL;DR:
  
We timed all our big announcements with events
 People really really love ducks
 TikTok converts surprisingly well
  
Here is the graph of our wishlists each day: https://imgur.com/a/wishlists-UEA6rAG
 1. Announcing the game and putting the steam page live happened simultaneously during the Wholesome Snack Showcase during the Game Awards. It’s hard to know how the steam algorithm truly works, but I believe this strong start gave us a boost to our baseline wishlists each day.
 You can see from the graph, but …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of publishers not linking the developer names on the Steam storefront to the developer page, but instead to their own publisher page. Steam allows a separate developer and publisher credit on each game so you can have it link to your personal page too. 
 I noticed when I want to follow a dev and I click their name it leads me to the publisher instead, which could be filled with random games and you get spammed whenever they announce a new one (some publishers are content farms, especially in the adult section) 
 If a player is interested in YOU they might want to follow YOU but can&#x27;t. You are leaving money on the table and on the publisher&#x27;s hands because:
  
Those followers get an email whenever you publish a game and you might want to do another game in the future.
 You can funnel them into other social media.
 In case you part ways with the publisher.
  
If you don&#x27;t work with a publisher you should get a creator page still, because if you don&#x27;t, Steam will only list your games without a following or featuring option. 
 If you are or plan to go on Steam make sure you create it since day one. I haven&#x27;t released a single game and haven&#x27;t promoted that page whatsoever and already got a following from my coming soon page. This means people actually click on the dev&#x27;s name to follow your profile. Not a lot, but not zero. They want to do it. I know because I want to do it too. 
 How to:
  
Here is the official Steam doc.
 Here is a better tutorial. (not mine)
  
Good luck in your projects everybody.

 Has anyone else noticed a ton of these types of low effort reviews on Steam from people who got free copies of the game? I&#x27;m wondering, why are developers giving copies to these people? How is this happening?

                              <span>We all know how easy it is to go down rabbit holes on fun features that you think you can make in two hours, but end up taking two weeks... just to break something else and spend another week fixing everything. 
 But have you ever made a simple change, addition, or removal that made a real difference for your players? 
 For example, for April Fools last year, I made our corgi character poop! It was a quick joke feature, spent 10 minutes adding it, but players at PAX loved it (especially eating it). 
 Meanwhile, I just spent a month trying to get our cutscenes looking good, and I feel like it&#x27;s still far from what I want, especially when I&#x27;m not sure how much people even care for story in a 3D platformer.
 I&#x27;ve heard 80% of the impact comes from 20% of the work. So, where do you feel the most impact for the least amount of work tends to come from?

                              <span>Hey folks!
 I recently ran into a situation with Go where I needed to parse / unmarshal JSON data with a recursive and polymorphic structure. I had to do a decent amount of research but eventually came up with a solution that I feel is reasonably elegant. Figured it was worth documenting and sharing since it might useful for other Go devs if they find themselves in a similar situation.

                              <span>I&#x27;m recently got introduced to the world of emulation and got recommended a CHIP-8 Emulator for my first project related to emulation.
 Everything was fine and I thought I nailed the project when I was able to render an IBM Logo and an Octojam 2 Title, feeling confident I completed the leftover opcode.
 After Completing All opcodes I tried to running Tetris &amp; some other games, but it didn&#x27;t seem to run as expected, the blocks are stuck in one place not able to move.I think its a problem related to looping or somewhere I must have incremented or not incremented the PC, but I can&#x27;t seem to fix it
 It would be really helpful if any assistance is provided

                              <span>I’m a CS student doing a 4 year course. How should I prepare for the future?
 My dreams of being a normal engineer working for a fairly satisfactory income seems to be in danger with the rise of AI.
 How can I still ensure I’ll have some job at the end of it all? What should I study/do after CS? I’m looking for some guidance. Vague guidance. Should I take AI related courses after this? I was planning on getting a job straight away but it seems now AI is all that will matter.

                              <span>Inspired by the many, many, many daily posts along the lines of &quot;Which programming language should I learn first?&quot; or &quot;Which language should I learn next?&quot; I took a walk down memory lane to figure out if I ever had to choose which language to learn - like make my own conscious choice, rather than just being &quot;forced&quot; into one language or another, either by circumstance or necessity.
 And I think that I can honestly say, that I never, not even for a moment, had to think about choosing a language - rather I had to figure out which language I had to learn, to solve the problem (or build the project) I was currently facing.
 My Journey
 My journey started a long time ago, back when every computer came with BASIC installed - so the choice was made for me, I had to learn BASIC. In fact I thought …</span>

                              <span>Hey,
 I wan&#x27;t to learn C# to use in Unity, but also to learn C++ to use for unreal engine at some point.
 I know both languages derive from C, but I have no purpose of C at this point. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;d make sense to learn anyway, to have that fundamental understandment.
 I kind of just wanna get started in programming, and learn one language to stick with for a while, because I have a feeling that they are fairly similar in terms of concept, just different syntax, but I don&#x27;t know what language to start with.
 My proficiency at the moment are just python and javascript.

                              <span>hello! I struggle with style of learning - do you use Chat GPT or not? What I mean, last year i have learned few months programming without any shortcut like struggle every problem with some CRUD topics, small problems, i have to figure it out and so on. But after break i&#x27;m back to programming today and even hyperskill have window for prompt AI and right now with the small task i use it and it give me almost full solution. Besides of figuring it out, reading stack overflow and so on it don&#x27;t take me 1 hour but 5 minutes. Im wondering it is good approach for learning like that right now? The quick time for solving and delivering it is important for me?

I am not talking about fetching the updates, as that depends on various factors, but the installation process. Both APT and DNF take a lot of time. Is this correct, or are all three the same?

 I&#x27;ve tried running the GNOME settings daemon but this leads to my DPI that I&#x27;ve set in my Xresources being overridden. 
 Is there a solution to this?

                              <span>I have to sit for up to a couple minutes whenever I boot into Debian and watch it bitch about various things before I can get into my desktop. Also, my system sometimes boots into a grub command line for some reason and have to type exit before I can even get to the grub boot selector.
 I am running UEFI because I dual boot Windows 11 &amp; Debian. Can someone help me get around these annoyances?

                              <span>Hi there! I currently use Ubuntu 24.04, but I&#x27;m considering changing to Debian 12, I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s an excellent distro. I&#x27;m still a newcomer to linux but I&#x27;m not afraid to get my hands dirty, I&#x27;m really planning to become a power user. The problem is that I&#x27;ve investigated that Debian sometimes has problems with recent hardware and my laptop is an Acer inspire 3-15, with amd Ryzen 5 processor and amd Radeon graphics as gpu. Do you think it&#x27;ll be compatible with Debian? Thanks in advance, God bless you 👍👍

                              <span>It seems that the past year or so has been a bit of a bloodbath in the “tech” sector in terms of layoffs etc. which got me thinking…
 How common are “good” programmers? That is, a programmer who can independently add value to a project, are curious and are always actively looking to improve their skills?
 I see a lot of people talking about how coders are now redundant and there are “no jobs” available but would it not be more accurate to say that the threshold for what makes you employable as a coder has undergone a correction of sorts?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve learned (in a lot of detail) a number of languages from different paradigms, studied type theory/ category theory, and have about 5 years of experience professionally. I&#x27;m gonna start doing some leetcode challenges (I don&#x27;t have a good reason other than it will give me piece of mind that I&#x27;m not getting too soft).
 Looking at the languages supported, I was gonna just do c++/python/js-ts, but then I thought &quot;wHy NoT LeArN a NeW LaNguAge???&quot;
 Like sure, I can dick around with elixr and install some dumb package manager and do all this leetcode crap in some language I don&#x27;t care about and will probably never earn a dime with, or I can just do all these dumb assignments in some other language I already know.
 Is &quot;learning all the languages&quot; just one of those thing we tell kids to do?

 like i wanted to know the implementation of sqrt() function &amp; I found it but now i want to know about implementation of others too like say for loop, like how a loop actually works. Does it use macro or recursion or what!? And it&#x27;s not just that, there are a lot of things whose implementation i want. It would be really thankful or i should say amazing if someone can share me any resource to find implementation of everything or most of..

                              <span>I joined the tech field straight out of college and believed that once I finally got out of a junior role I&#x27;d be &quot;set for life&quot;, but y&#x27;all already know how how naive that is.
 I was talking to one of our staff engineers, brilliant lady with 20 years in the field, about her experience last month. I was disappointed not only that she confirmed what I had been hearing about ageism in the field, but just how rampant it was.
 At least one of you reading this has encountered ageism at some point in your career, but lived to tell the tale. How did you survive the wave of layoffs? How did you land that new job?

                              <span>My manager is ok. No serious toxic traits, but I’ve had 4 other managers and this one my least favorite and it’s not even close. Overall they aren’t very inspiring and have little vision of their own. It’s very hard to grow. As I’ve been growing and leading more changes across teams, the outgrowth has become particularly painful. Getting the buy-in through the layers of management AND cross functionally is so much work and at this point, I’ve pretty much just resorted to having monthly 1:1s with my skip where I just sell them and only update my manager because I know I’m supposed to. (Btw- I do understand it is my job to manage up and a good skill to develop. I have been at it with this manager for a year and at this point, it is just an inefficient use of my time and energy. I have a solid reputation and am thus actually in talks to report a level higher. I am also considering moving teams.)
 What are the possible options and what have you done?
  
Move teams
 Negotiate reporting to a higher level up
 Take advantage of it and coast
 Change companies

                              <span>Simple question.
 I can do the fancy pages, I can also code do the landing page with custom designs from a designer. 
 But I am not sure what to tell a client that asks me whether their landing page would be better suited to one of those drag-n-drop site builders.
 I tried to look at some of the samples from the site builders, it seems like they work well when the page is just static assets and the design consists mostly of box-shaped divs that either have text or images. Not sure though because I don&#x27;t have any experience with their sites.

 I interviewed for an out of state job recently, where they seem to have a fixed salary structure based on responsibilities. The salary listed is about $15-30k lower than what I&#x27;d normally get in my state for the same role. When I asked about it, they said they do it for equity reasons to make sure there&#x27;s not a huge discrepancy of pay between coworkers (i.e. fairness). It&#x27;s a startup. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s such thing as asking for cost of living adjustments. Anyone have insights or experiences they can share? Pros/cons?

 Professionally I&#x27;ve used C++11 for years (or most of it anyway, I&#x27;ve used perfect forwarding but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever written an initializer list) so I&#x27;m a bit behind. It&#x27;s a bit embarrassing considering it&#x27;s the language I&#x27;ve used the most by an extremely large margin.

                              <span>I am self teaching myself C++ from learncpp.com. I am on chapter 2 which is where it goes over functions and their different types.
 Once thing i&#x27;ve notices is that it keeps going over the same code it went over before and modifying it to find out different ways you can go about writing the code.
 For example: Void and Int functions.
 I&#x27;m quite familiar with int functions but quite confused on void because it doesn&#x27;t explain what it is very well. In section 2.4 it goes off imediatley showing a code I practised alot and understand how it works but then soon shows how we can make it work with the void function.
 The code (Int):
 include 
 int getValueFromUser() { std::cout &gt; input; return input; }
 int main() { int num{ getValueFromUser() }; std::cout 
 int getValueFromUser() { std::cout &gt; input; return input; }
 void printDouble(int value) { std::cout &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; &quot; Doubled is: &quot; &lt;&lt; value * 2 &lt;&lt; &#x27;\n&#x27; }
 int main() { int num { getValueFromUser() }; printDouble(num); return 0; }
  
My biggest annoyance here is why are you trying to make me do 50 extra steps to a code I already got good at, no wonder i&#x27;m confused on how your explaining things.
 Any better tutorial so I don&#x27;t have to deal with this?

 Write a function named outOfOrder that takes as parameters an array of
 double s and an int parameter named size and returns a value of type
 int. This function will test this array for being out of order, meaning that
 the array violates the following condition:
 a[0] 
 using namespace std;
 double sum &#x3D; 0;
 void OutOfOrder(double s[], int size);
 int main(){
 double InOrder[6] &#x3D; {222,234,278,300,586,1000};
 double NotOrdered[5] &#x3D; {1,6,3,4,5};
 OutOfOrder(NotOrdered, 5);
 }
 void OutOfOrder(double s[], int size) {
 for (int x &#x3D; 0; x  s[x + 1]){
 sum &#x3D; x;
 break;}
 }
 cout &lt;&lt; sum;

Each header file uses the full file path as the header guard (e.g. a/b/c.h uses __A_B_C_H__ for its header guard).
 Each source/header file is wrapped in a namespace that mirrors the file path (e.g. everything in a/b/c.h is in namespace a::b::c).
  
Is this too much? Do other projects do similar things? My thinking with the two points above was that it&#x27;ll almost eliminate any name conflicts and it&#x27;ll organize things the way I see them in the file system. The only problem is that it&#x27;ll be tedious if I ever have to move files around.

                              <span>Can anyone recommend some learning resources for writing and compiling actual executable software? I have some c++ and programming experience but it is limited to scripting and programming Arduino. In college I took intro to c++ and a computational fluid dynamics course in which I wrote c++ scripts to solve and model differential equations. I am a mechanical engineer so I have also used matlab extensively for work, programmed robots in a language similar to python, lua for writing touchOSC scripts, and VBA for automating excel. It’s quite a hodgepodge of programming skill sets and again all individual scripts of varying complexity.
 I am now working on a project developing software for a multitrack looper for making music. I am currently using an open source software looping program but would like to write my own. 
 This would be a “real” program, something with a rudimentary UI and multiple functions that can be compiled and run as an executable. I am having trouble figuring out how to make the jump from simple scripts to actual software development. Can you point me in the direction of some learning resources to move from this sort of “beginner” level programming to something more intermediate level?

 https://imgur.com/a/D879o4C 
 And I have no idea why this is happening? 
 I have only recently started to try to learn C++ but this error has only occurred when I made a fresh install of Windows 10 after dual booting Linux. 
 I have followed the steps to download a C++ Compiler and have confirmed it has been installed via the recommended inputs to CMD. 
 The folder in which my files are saved in was made on my original install of Windows 10 and not my current install.

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I was wondering if you guys have any resources with regards to using maps and the iterator design pattern? I am trying to follow the one from the Head First Design Pattern books where it only has the function hasNext() and Next(). On paper it seems straightforward but I am trying to pinpoint if my problem is with the understanding of what exactly is a map iterator and what exactly I am passing. With regards to my uni textbook, it does not cover maps.
 To my understanding, a map is composed of a pair struct where first is the key and the other is the value. In order to go through the whole map I need the iterator for the first element and the last element and I can get those via map.begin() and map.end() and an iterator can be progressed via the ++ operator. I am trying to protect my map by encapsulating it in a class thus an iterator class is the only way for me to go through the map. Now I am confused as to what exactly I should be passing when I am iterating and how I can control access of the iterator so as not to expose my map.

 I tried swap positions, add extra fields, and could be sure it&#x27;s always the penultimate field get a certain value, 1.
 I reckon this behavior is implementation-defined, just curious.
 Can you guys replicate it on your computer?

 $ sudo apt install libmysqlcppconn-dev
 Then, I can connect with MySQL and C++. But in Window, it is so bad, and I search the driver at MySQL official Website. I can&#x27;t use it in VS Code. When I search how can I use the drive, the only way I found is to use Visual Studio. But I wanna connect MySQL with C++ without Visual Studio. How can I do this way on Window. Please point me out. Can I do it or not.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to implement precompiled headers in my project. The project compiles, but I&#x27;m not sure if I implemented the PCH part correctly. I suspect I didn&#x27;t because after adding ImGui, the compilation time takes a good minute, and I&#x27;m not noticing any compile speed difference.
 If someone is willing to review what I have so far, and let me know what I&#x27;m doing wrong, I would be really appreciative.

                              <span>i am doing a recursive merge sort for a singly linked list. this is a part of the code i have:
 struct node { int value; node* next; }; ... node* mergesort(node* input, int length) { if(length value, nullptr}; } } … } 
 this is the documentation from my professor about that function:
 /* mergesort(input, length) Recursively Mergesort the &#x60;input&#x60; list (whose length is given by &#x60;length&#x60;), returning a new sorted list. Must run in O(n log n) time, where n &#x3D; &#x60;length&#x60;. Must use O(n) space (returned list is created new). NOTE: The &#x60;input&#x60; list must not be modified in any way. */ 
 and these are a couple of the requirements for our code:
  
The returned list must be entirely new; none of its -&gt;next pointers should point into the input list.
 Your code must not allocate any dynamic memory other than what is required for the nodes of the returned list. (The test code will destroy this list before exiting, so if run in Valgrind, it should report no memory leaks.)
  
in my professor&#x27;s test file, the sorted list is destroyed and heap memory is freed. however running the program with valgrind tells me i am leaking 10,115,136 bytes in 632,196 blocks and I cannot figure out why. if anybody could help me out i would greatly appreciate it

                              <span>I used to program in c/c++ back in the day (15 yrs ago) but haven&#x27;t followed the developments since then, so I&#x27;m unfamiliar with all the newfangled features in the new c++ standards. I&#x27;m reading the book &quot;A Tour of C++&quot; (3rd ed) and this tells me, didactically, what new c++ looks like, but since the best way to learn is to read/execute &amp; experiment with code, I wonder if anyone knows of a good codebase that uses the modern idioms? In particular, I want to see good use of concepts, templates, modern STL usage, &quot;memory-safe&quot; pointer mechanisms. The book is excellent, but it only has code snippets. 
 I&#x27;m particularly interested in client/server stuff, so (for example) a socket server/client would be magnificent. This is not to say that other sorts of projects wouldn&#x27;t be welcome.

                              <span>Yeah just a thought. I feel like tech hiring isn’t really “bad”, of course it is compared to a few years ago, but for a job that (in the big places) pays way more than IB starting, cooler work, better culture and WLB, it’s only natural that it gets ultra competitive.
 It’s still possible to get tech jobs, it’s just really hard and you have to put in all the stops (just like I see my friends in IB doing), so target school, networking, interview prep, resume padding, the whole thing. 
 I think the old times were a bit of a fever dream and now it’s just reality. Tech is still a great option but it (rightfully) is now really competitive just like IB is. I feel like the FAANG+ SWE life is a pretty great one, so it only makes sense that the process of getting it becomes more and more competitive 
 Thoughts?

                              <span>I see that most people get jobs and internships through connections/nepotism. I think in academia it&#x27;s even worse as professors only choose the PhD students who they have either worked with or through referrals who they know. So basically people who don&#x27;t know the right people, can&#x27;t do much in life.

                              <span>Title says it all. Everyone tells you to do personal projects, but not just any projects, something that you created with your own skills. They tell you to not follow Youtube tutorials, make it creative and different to stand out. My thing is, why do all that when employers don&#x27;t even take the time to look at what you have created? Just grind LeetCode? Well people will tell you, &quot;I never did LeetCode and I had 3 internships, just make stuff.&quot; How tf do you make stuff without knowing where to even start?

                              <span>bad at math but will major in CS, fuck it. im sick of living my life in fear.
 i honestly couldnt find anything else to major in, everything else had something in it that killed the mood for me, medicine takes too long and is too expensive, engineering is not something i see myself doing for the rest of my life, IT is like comp sci but less money and job offers, i even thought of criminology but i wont make that much money.
 all throughout highschool, all i was ever told was i couldn’t focus, i could do better, i wont make it in life, why? because i didnt give enough of a fuck in highschool to sit down and learn. i didnt like the teachers, i didnt like the students, i didnt like the school itself, i just slept during all my classes.
 im not stupid, i never was, i just never put in the effort, was never excited for something.
 if comp sci will be the death of me then i accept it as a punishment. i will major in it and i will teach myself the fundamentals.

                              <span>Hey y’all, I’m asking this question on here since the internet is not turning up any results here.
 I have a windows SYSTEM and SAM registry file exported onto my VM that I’m trying to extract password hashes from. I’ve been testing SamDump2, but it doesn’t seem to be working as intended (I know my password. When hashing it with Windows’ NT/LM algorithms, the results aren’t matching with what SamDump2 is giving me). 
 My question is - does SamDump2 still work for windows 11, and if not, what’s a tool that works for that version?

                              <span>I saved from a ewaste bin an old HP compaq 6730s. It ran on windows Vista but it has every boot options aside from hard disk locked out by an unretrievable bios password. I&#x27;d like to put Linux on it and I managed to install OS swapping the HD on another machine, problem is I really want to get rid of that password for future updates. Now I know I can probably buy an unprotected eeprom chip ans swap it but I&#x27;m not this good at soldering and I&#x27;d prefer to explore software solutions. 
 HP has a command line tool (part of its client management tool set) called bios configurator utility. My understanding is that it requires the old password to replace it with a new one and it may accept plain text options for both (although I&#x27;m not sure if it only accept hashed versions in bin files at least for the old one. My questions are - may a bruteforce approach be viable? What would you suggest me to use first (e.g. Dictionary, rainbow tables...)in a hypotetical powershell script to cycle through, considering that I&#x27;m not a skilled programmer and it would be run on a slow machine? - are there other no-solder approaches I should also consider? Like, can I dump the eeprom chip and try to decode the password from there? 
 Other things I tried: CMOS battery is not an option: it ran out but password is still there and if I input the wrong passwords I don&#x27;t get to read the code that can be used for retrieving hard-coded backdoors

 Would it be using a sim for internet with a wireguard vpn?
 (I don’t quite understand how a VPN through the router provides more anonymity then a vpn application besides all devices connected being routed through)

                              <span>I’m a Ruby Dev with the 5 years of experience, and within the last few months began to tinker around with Go as it had peaked my interest. Luckily I had a recruiter reach out to me about a Go Role, and I passed the technical rounds and landed the role. I start next month. 
 I’ve spent the last few months building assorted things to drill at least a surface level understanding of various aspects of the language, to make the transition easier. 
 My question to all of you is, if you could go back and tell yourself what concepts to really nail as you were about to begin your first Go Role, what would they be? Or any tips in general.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Mongo in production and working on how to handle migrations. My database still has a schema; the schema is just shifted from SQL table definitions over into the code itself. If I change the format of a struct representing the document in a collection or add a relational field to another collection, previous records in the DB need to be updated to reflect this, or I end up with bad data.
 Right now I&#x27;m handling this with a function for each migration step. Each migration has an ID associated to it and I keep a migrations collection with the timestamp when this migration was run (if it was run). This way I don&#x27;t have to rerun any previous steps. I&#x27;m trying to make each one idempotent, so even without the migration collection, they could potentially run again if needed. The &quot;migrations&quot; collection is just for performance purposes, to avoid having to run all historic migrations every time the app starts.
 I&#x27;ve been reading about the various SQL DB migration tools, and declarative state based migrations vs functional time-series migrations. The latter sounds roughly like what I&#x27;m doing. I&#x27;m mostly just trying to understand if what I&#x27;m doing is common or if there&#x27;s some better way that I hadn&#x27;t considered (and why?)
 How are you dealing with this?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I’d like to introduce AMIGO, a library that simplifies database migrations using the Go language.
 It&#x27;s heavily inspired by the ActiveRecord migration system; while I am not a fan of Rails, I was pleased to use the migration system. 
 Here is an attempt to be as happy as I was with active records. It offers a powerful API to manage schema changes and supports auto-reverse migrations. 
 It only supports Postgres for now. 
 Please try it and give me some feedback! 😇
 Check it out on GitHub

                              <span>Hey r/golang, 
 I&#x27;ve put together a bare-bones quick start repo for connecting OTEL, Prometheus, Promtail, Loki, Tempo and Grafana together in docker-compose.
 I noticed that a lot of similar examples, videos and articles end up showcasing useful features of the services with an emulator (like K6), however, it can be a bit tricky going through the motions the first few times and making sure spans are set up correctly so node graphs / service graphs are enabled etc.
 Thus, I have included a simple 3 server setup in addition to a K6 simulator to show a crude example of how to get real traces and logs pumping into the observability stack as well!
 If you&#x27;re already familiar with these technologies then this may not be useful but if you&#x27;ve wanted to give it a go but unsure where to start then feel free to clone this and play around.

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m trying to build a simple calculator program in C using stdio.h library, but I&#x27;m hitting a dead end with getting accurate results. I&#x27;ve been staring at my code for hours and can&#x27;t seem to spot the issue.
 Here&#x27;s the deal ... my calculator isn&#x27;t giving me the right answers for certain expressions. For instance, when I input &quot;-3 + 2 * 5&quot;, I expect the output to be 7, which it is in the first output, but if I put the same printf(&quot;%d&quot;, calc(&quot; -3 + 2 * 5 &quot;));, multiple times in a row , the next output&#x27;s value skyrockets and every next output is a larger number.
 I tried all this implementing Shunting Yard Algorithm and it feels like the logic is sound, but clearly something&#x27;s off.
 My question is would someone mind taking a look at my code to see if they can spot any sneaky bug…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for some resources on writing parallel code and drivers for that code in C (for a raytracer). I know there&#x27;s OpenCL, but all the tutorials are either outdated or for C++. I&#x27;ve already programmed with AMD Hip, but it&#x27;s not cross platform. I&#x27;ve thought of using OpenGL, but it&#x27;s deprecated on mac. Vulkan seems a bit heavy-handed. I&#x27;m open to any suggestions. Thanks!

 int x[2];
 int y[4][3];
 What would be the types of &amp;x, x, *y, &amp;y and y? My intuition tells me it should be int**, int*, int*, int*** and int** since from my experience arrays are not really types, just pointers. However, chatgpt tells me it should be int(*)[2], int[2], int[3], int(*)[4][3] and int[4][3]. Can someone clarify please?

                              <span>I was studying parts of the musl source code, and I noticed a recurring pattern to convert between pointers of often-unrelated types, e.g.
 size_t *sp &#x3D; ...; // ... char **argv &#x3D; (void *)(sp+1); 
 or
 size_t dyn[DYN_COUNT]; // ... const Sym *syms &#x3D; (void *)dyn[DT_SYMTAB]; 
 The configure script has a comment stating that
 # Semantically we want to insist that our sources follow the # C rules for type-based aliasing, but most if not all real-world # compilers are known or suspected to have critical bugs in their # type-based aliasing analysis. See for example GCC bug 107107. 
 so I assume that, even though the project disables strict aliasing checks explicitly, the above pattern should remain valid even if they were enabled.
 Is my assumption correct? If not, how would one go about interpreting a region of memory as different types (e.g., when implementing file format parsers, or manipulating in-memory data structures provided by an operating system kernel)?
 EDIT: The second example is harmless, as it creates a pointer from an integer. Thanks u/aocregacc for pointing it out!

                              <span>GNU C allows enclosing a compound statement within parentheses to make it an expression, whose outcome is the value of its last statement (can be void).
 https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Statement-Exprs.html
 This has several useful applications, but for now I&#x27;ll single out the implementation of generic function-like macros.
 #define absv(n) ({auto _n &#x3D; n; _n &lt; 0 ? -_n : _n;}) // suppress macro invocation\ by calling it as (absv)(-42) long double fabsl(long double), (*absv)(long double) &#x3D; fabsl; 
 This extension has been available for a long time; I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s been any official proposal to standardize this in ISO C.
 https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/wg14_document_log.htm
 I browsed through WG14 document log entries with the search terms &quot;expression&quot;, &quot;gcc&quot;, &quot;gnu&quot;, and &quot;statement&quot;, but none of the results matched the requirement.
 Does anyone know why there&#x27;s an (apparent) lack of interest towards incorporating this feature in ISO C? Is it because of the non-trivial changes required in C&#x27;s fundamental grammar, or is there any other impediment to formally describing its specification?

                              <span>Hi there, I am making a cli app much like htop but unfortunately i won’t able to find any great TUI library written in C other than ncurses, notcurses, etc. which are more of renderers. I want something like ratatui in rust, I am aware that there are similay libraries written in C++. But is there any in C?

                              <span>This code was a template that was provided by my uni, and had to adapt to work with what the teacher asked.
 Ive been around this code for 2 weeks and i have no idea why it always returns a 0 value.
 This is supposed to take in a txt file that has coordinates that are used to make a graph, number of people, number of supermarkets, coordinates of the people, coordinates of the supermarkets. Code uses the coordinates to create a graph, and is supposed to find the best possible solution to bring each person to a supermarket (once 1 person goes to the supermarket, another cant enter the same one) 
 The code perfectly reads the file, since at the end it identifys how many markets, people, etc are in. But for someon reason it never gives me any solution. its always 0.
 Im sorry if this is a shit…</span>

                              <span>i recently asked about pointers &amp; was told it can help memory etc. This is how i have my account struct right now 
 struct accountinfo_t { char username[32]; char password[32]; char expire[32]; char MyFDip[32]; enum { client, admin, } admin; // 0 client, 1 admin enum { offline, online, } authenticated; // 0 offline, 1 connected } accounts[MAXFDS]; 
 When a user logs in there FD represents the array number in the struct. IS there a better method todo this?

                              <span>So, I have my installation of Debian 12 and it&#x27;s perfect, I love it. It would be a happy tale, but I&#x27;m starting a job soon that will require software available only on Windows, so i&#x27;m thinking of dualbooting. However, most dualboot installation guide assume that you&#x27;re coming from Windows and otherwise advise you to install it first for some reason that it handles disk space differently from linux or whatever... How do I dualboot without reinstalling my debian? I love my install, it&#x27;s pretty much perfect at this point and I&#x27;m afraid that windows will mess with it once I install it just next to debian. Also, I don&#x27;t have my drive partitioned correctly, I think, I just have all my memory in my ~ folder. Any advice?

                              <span>Is there some repository that builds latest gdb for Debian? I know I can build it myself manually, but repository would be nicer. Debian unstable still has only gdb 13.2. I was interested in testing new native DAP integration in gdb 14.x.
 And it&#x27;s been a while since 14.1 came out (December 2023).

 Anyways what i&#x27;m having issues with is the computer defaulting to using the wlan over the lan. i can tell it to default to lan running this command sudo ip route replace default via 192.168.0.1 dev eno1 that works temporarily. If i unhook the ethernet and power it up be default to wlan which is good.. but if I reconnect the ethernet it still defaults to wlan and i have to ssh back in and run the replace default gw command again. I would like it to connect to both and fail back to wlan when lan isnt connected but then default back to lan after the cable is plugged back in (after a reboot is fine)
 Thanks for any help &#x3D;)

 https://pipewire.pages.freedesktop.org/wireplumber/daemon/configuration/migration.html#config-migration
 You may have customized your audio Lua scripts to fix, for example, the subwoofer and center speakers being swapped in their output. This causes the output of the center speaker to be garbled. This is a common problem with Linux and audio cards, such as for USB-attached Dolby 7.1 surround sound cards.
 To see whether you have version 0.5 or later of WirePlumber:

 Just upgraded to 6.9.1 and yuck. For whatever reason, it is playing havoc with CPU scheduling. It seems to have put everything on one core with the other CPU cores trickling at 1-3% utilization. As soon as ANY application runs/loads it bottlenecks everything else.
 Downgrading to the last kernel resolves.

                              <span>Heyo! I need some help.
 I&#x27;ve recently gone ahead to install Arch and attempt to basically daily drive it for a bit. I went ahead to install Plasma 6 alongside pipewire and ffmpeg, everything seemed to be going steadily, however I have run into a bit of a roadblock, as I&#x27;ve been trying to look up things about what&#x27;s been going on, yet nothing has seemed to work. Let me explain.
 For every single application I have tested, (Web browser, the KDE sound test, Discord, basically all of the apps that I need to not have delayed audio, for the desktop to be smooth-sailing) and all of them weirdly showed the same problem. (Playing audio for the first time would show a ~0.4s delay before playing, and after pausing/having zero sound being played in the moment, would &quot;reset&quot; the timer and give me more delay.) Weirdly, this did not have an affect with the sync as you&#x27;d might expect, but that&#x27;s made it significantly more difficult to find a solution to the problem I&#x27;ve been facing, this also seems to only be happening with my built-in laptop speakers, and not with any bluetooth/wired headphones.
 If any other information is needed I&#x27;ll gladly bring it up, but I believe (currently) that this is the best I can do. Thanks in advance! :-)

                              <span>What is your thoughts on keeping your game secret? Vs. sharing it for exposure? Is there a certain stage of development where it makes sense to start releasing footage of it for marketing purposes? Is it paranoid to be afraid of one&#x27;s idea getting stolen? Please share any thoughts on this subject.
 I have been developing a game full-time for almost a year by myself. The game is an idea that I have had for a while and that I believe to be both original and eye-catching. I myself enjoy playing what I have created so far, and friends and family that have played have also had the reaction that I was hoping for.
 As of now I have been keeping my game very close to the chest. But I am currently considering looking for investments in my game and then I would obviously have to share everything about it. I am not super scared that a potential investor would steal it, since I would try to only approach serious actors but if you have any thoughts on this please share them.
 Edit:
 Thank you all for your input! But all I see is a bunch of people trying to convince me to share my idea so they can steal it.. /s No, but for real, I really appreciate all your views and I hear what many of you are saying about the importance of exposure and the low likelihood that anyone will put in the effort to steal something that has not yet been proven. I will rethink my approach and will share my game sooner than I intended. But first I want to have a few more features in place and some minimal polishing as well. The thought of sharing it is a little scary but also cool since it feel more real in a way.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on my game for around 2-3 years. There were times when I was anxious about negative feedback and the lack of wishlists. But 2 days ago, I launched my game. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m feeling right now.
 Firstly, I feel relaxed and calm. I&#x27;m also missing the sense of &quot;I have work to do&quot;, which was a huge part of my life every day for the last few years. All that tension is gone. I feel empty, but in a good way. I&#x27;m still getting used to the feeling of having nothing to do.
 Yesterday, a few hours after launch, I went out and met some friends and had a good time. I didn&#x27;t think about my game at all (which was weird to be honest). Today, I cleared out some old junk in my &quot;studio&quot;. I also wiped clean the white board I used to write my daily to-do lists. It&#x27;s blank for the first time in many years. That&#x27;s exactly how I am feeling.
 I know there&#x27;s still work to do with regard to promotions and fixing game issues as and when they come up. But I know for a fact that the actual mountain of gamedev work has been conquered. This feeling of knowing I&#x27;ve reached my goal is incredible. Guys, I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a high, but it&#x27;s a high. Not an intense high. But a high nonetheless.
 IMO completing my game and releasing it is the conclusion of my game dev journey, or at least the first of many journeys. Although, the sales have been so-so thus far (don&#x27;t ask about it), it does feel immensely rewarding to just know that my creation is out there, and that people are playing it! 
 Regardless of what happens, I know my future self will look back on these post-launch moments fondly. I think whatever I&#x27;m feeling makes the struggle worth it. I also know that if there existed a club for indie devs who have completed and published a game, I&#x27;m officially in it.
 Anyway, if you&#x27;re a new solo indie game developer reading this, trust me when I say that completing an indie game and publishing it is an awesome feeling. In fact, it&#x27;s a huge achievement in and of itself.

                              <span>As a solo dev, I have a commercial game on Steam that hasn&#x27;t even made back 10% of my investment. Despite being a financial failure, I&#x27;m quite proud of the quality and depth of the game. Its genre is a bit hard to describe, so let&#x27;s go with &quot;an innovative roguelike/RPG where conflicts are resolved through various, procedurally generated word puzzles&quot;.
 Since the first version, I have published three free content updates (and hotfixes) and responded to all support questions, either by email or on the Steam forum. However, I cannot afford to spend more effort on this game, and I&#x27;ve moved on to other projects.
 Today, a fan asked on the Steam forum if they can expect new stories and game events. I&#x27;m not sure how to express that, due to the poor sales, I am unable to provide support beyond bug fixes. I&#x27;d rather not ignore the question because it would make the game look completely abandoned.

                              <span>Those moments when everything clicks are pure magic. It&#x27;s exhilarating. You lose yourself in the flow, and the world fades away and find yourself repeating stuff like: &quot;Can&#x27;t hang out, I&#x27;m on the verge of a breakthrough&quot;, &quot;Can we do it tomorrow? Or maybe a week after that?&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;d love to, but i just need to finish something first&quot;. Your friends and loved ones might think you&#x27;ve gone MIA, but you&#x27;re in your happy place, building something incredible. What do you mean i spend too much time on my computer? Why would i want to go outside? 
 Days blend into a blissful blur of code, creativity, and caffeine. What year is this? Who&#x27;s the president? Did you eat today? Who knows! I really don&#x27;t have time to think about stuff like that.
 And let&#x27;s talk about the focus. Anything that pulls you away from your game feels like a distraction from your true calling. A ringing phone? How rude! An unexpected visit? The nerve! Your game demands your full attention, like an engrossing novel you can&#x27;t put down. 
 Finishing and polishing a game? Oh, that&#x27;s a whole new level of self-inflicted torture. It&#x27;s a hands-down personal crisis every time. You start questioning your intelligence, your life choices, your sanity. I AM NEVER DOING THIS AGAIN, EVER! You look in the mirror and wonder who that haggard, sleep-deprived zombie is. But as you trudge through the endless bugs and polish sessions, the dust eventually settles. And what do you do? You find yourself prototyping the next game. Because why not repeat the cycle of pain and questionable decisions?
 So here we are, fellow indie devs, riding the rollercoaster of our self-imposed addiction. Here’s to another round of sleepless nights, endless debugging, and the faint hope that this game will be the one. Bottoms up! 🥂🍺 Or am I the weird one here?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a self taught programmer since I was an early teenager, and am currently in university studying software development. For my master&#x27;s, I have a chance of studying game development, but I&#x27;m torn on the idea.
 I love game development and awlays have, but I fear that it&#x27;s a dy path with low income and rare success. On one hand, I want to follow my dreams and working on projects that make me happy. On the other hand I don&#x27;t want to struggle to make my career a reality.
 What are your experiences?

 Although the act leaned more towards Manufacturing Jobs and Federal Spending to US Private Contractors that would turn around and outsource the costs of the service, there hasn&#x27;t been much progress since 2021/2022 
 
No Tax Breaks for Outsourcing Act (2023) - [Link]
 Which mostly aimed at killing tax incentives for multinationals that shipped overseas. The approach here seems to rollback Trump-era tax breaks for corporations, and increase taxes on foreign profits therefore increasing local profits and disincentivizing outsourcing.
 
 ​
 All in all, the outsourcing problem seems complex and intertwined with very touchy facets of US commerce and labor, coupled with corporate desire for Short-Term profits. We cannot forget how the outsourcing plague in the mid-80s killed many American automotive manufacturing jobs and partly led to the demise of prosperous US Cities e.g. Detroit
 Do you think with the recent layoffs both in Tech and other fields that there is a likelihood that such legislation will be brought back up? This is existentially a battle between labor and corporations and historically we know who the winner has been at least in the past 50 years

                              <span>Is there something called Don&#x27;t hire list ?
 There is this company who does remote hiring and in their assessment on coderbyte they have a closure saying something like &quot;getting flagged in this assessment will make you on a no-hire list that is shared across companies&quot;. I didn&#x27;t take the assessment not to get false flagged and get screwed for something like that
 Was wondering if this is a thing that companies share a list for employees to not hire or it&#x27;s just something internal for that specific company that if you get flagged they themselves won&#x27;t hire you but not other companies?

                              <span>I have an algorithm planned out that stores massive trees that contain floating point data and requires very fast lookup, I was going to implement it in C++ but the perks of rust is making me re-think my decision.
 For people that have experience with these data types with c++ and rust, how does the performance differ between the 2 languages. Compilation time does not matter to me, only runtime performance.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve heard a lot that a benefit for using terminal software over GUI apps is that they use much less resources. And that&#x27;s why its better to SSH into servers rather than have them use up resources for a display server, Quartz X11 Wayland etc.. But terminals aren&#x27;t just outputting raw text, they have text and background colors per character, TUI frameworks have been made for them to essentially have GUI-like elements, like Neovim and Ranger. Things like the Kitty Graphics Protocol seem to blur the lines. While I don&#x27;t know the technical details (please explain if you can!), it&#x27;s nice that it can render images in the terminal, but how is it different, especially the technical details and resource demand (CPU GPU RAM etc.) to display servers?! Does it work without a display server running on …</span>

 About 5 months ago I posted about making a windows linux installer. I&#x27;ve updated it a bit and configured it to work with the latest Linux Mint release. If anyone&#x27;s interested feel free to give it a try.
 &quot;Please don&#x27;t use on your main/mission critical PC as this program is in alpha.
 To use just run installlinux.bat as administrator, which installs grub2win. Then in the command prompt window that appeared initially, press any key to continue to copy over config files and the linux mint iso. Then your computer should automatically restart and boot the linux mint iso (if secure boot was succesfully disabled, otherwise you have to disable it.)
 Thanks!&quot;

                              <span>As a project to learn C++, I decided to create my own bytecode based on Dotnet CIL and Python Bytecode. Everything is going great so far, but I&#x27;ve run into a hiccup during the tokenization stage of parsing my binary bytecode file.
 The way I store all of the bytecode instructions in memory is with these structures (and a union inside byte_token, defined in the code block below)
 I have a class ByteDecoder that tokenizes everything and places the tokens inside a std::vector&amp;. The issue I&#x27;m facing is when trying to make an instance of a byte_token, I get a series of errors saying that the constructor and deconstructor are deleted functions. AI told me that this is because of something happening with the constructor of the members within the union not being initialized. I have no …</span>

                              <span>Hello, so I&#x27;ve been using learncpp.com along with visual code community 2022 to learn. The way I would teach myself is to make notes and pratice writing the code presented from scratch without looking at the code. I would keep doing that until I dig it deep into my memory.
 The issue i&#x27;m having is that I keep thinking and worrying myself that I will forget everything i&#x27;ve learned and struggling to keep the basic facts in my head such as &quot;What is a variable?&quot; &quot;How do functions work?&quot; and I feel like i&#x27;m missing important information.
 Is there any better way to do this?

                              <span>Hey! I&#x27;m looking to make a C++ game engine/framework to hopefully make a game at some point.
 I&#x27;ve been using C++ for about a year at this point and have mostly specialized in rendering with OpenGL. I haven&#x27;t fully grasped all concepts around memory and memory management (I know what a pointer is and that is really it). I&#x27;m also considering C for that same reason.
 I&#x27;m looking for a place where I can find collaborators that would help me build a engine/framework, and help me with all the memory stuff. I already posted on a discord server about game dev, but most people seem to be unity programmers or things other than programming.
 Thanks in Advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to write a little program for learning the basics of clean architecture.
 I&#x27;d like to implement the interfaces that are used in the business logic layer by using template bindinds with concepts, in order to determine at compile time the right interfaces, avoiding to create an interface, a realization of it and then passing the pointer in the constructor. Instead I&#x27;d like to:
  
Define the methods of an &quot;interface&quot; that are needed by the business case in a concept.
 Create a concrete implementation of the interface without using inheritance, and so using virtual functions (I&#x27;d like to use the methods in critical performance path, where indirection time matters)
 Allowing to unit test the business case, because without a virtual interface I cannot use mock libraries like FakeIT.
  
So my question is: where can I find some good resource about concept and using them for dependency injection?

                              <span>I was working on a personal project yesterday in C++23 and was running into a linker (ld) error stating that my constexpr had undefined symbols. After some digging, I realized that constexpr objects are implicitly inline and must have their definitions visible at every compiler stage.
 That being said, I had to move the function definitions from their .cpp source file into their header file, but I was wondering if there was still a way to keep the definition in a separate file (while preserving their constexpr modifier)?

                              <span>My project is currently using mutexes for a singleton pattern initialization. Is it now true that if I use a static local variable, a boolean that tracks if initialization has occurred globally, that I no longer need to use a mutex? If this is not true, is there something faster than a mutex that is also platform independent? I&#x27;m looking at the critical sections but they are Win32. Is what I am doing fast enough? I&#x27;m always trying to shave off runtime and get more performance.

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;m working as a C++ dev, and there&#x27;s a pattern that&#x27;s everywhere in my company&#x27;s codebase. But I&#x27;m still quite early in my career so tbh it has my doubting myself. I thought this violated strict-aliasing rules so was undefined behaviour, but with how much I&#x27;m seeing it in our code it has me doubting myself. As this is written by people with a lot more experience then me.
 If you have a char* or uint8_t* you&#x27;ve read off a socket or character device:
 char buffer[512]; // or std::uint8_t buffer[512] // imagine we&#x27;re reading from a device or socket into the buffer here... // then later: const std::uint32_t *ptr &#x3D; reinterpret_cast(buffer); const uint32_t n &#x3D; ntohl(*ptr); // etc... 
 I don&#x27;t see -fno-strict-aliasing in our compiler flags either. But I thought that while you can cast a pointer to any type to a char/uint8_t pointer, it doesn&#x27;t work the other way round. The compiler is free to optimise based on that assumption, not to mention issues with alignment, caching etc. 
 If I&#x27;m wrong can someone explain where how? I may have misunderstood aliasing rules. Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Since the beginning of the year I have had write C++ in an environment that unfortunately uses the the Dinkumware implementation of the std lib: C++Builder 11. During this time I’ve been bitten by a plethora of in your face bugs that have forced me to invest a bunch of time into understanding and then circumventing the issues. To name just a few:
  
std::optional doesn’t compile
 std::optional doesn’t compile
 std::visit is broken
 std::variant::operator &#x3D; will silently mess things up by setting the wrong index
 std::unordered_set::extract will return a handle that when destroyed decrements the number of elements in the collection. So one extract causes two sides decrements.
  
Fortunately, the last version of C++ Builder seems to be moving away from Dinkumware, but until I upgrade, is anyone here aware of a broader list of Dinkumware bugs? Is Dinkumware such a poor quality implementation? Has it always been like that?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have a Computer Science background. I graduated College with solid experience in Linux/FreeBSD (used to work at an ISP running everything). My first job was as a general SysAdmin, then I moved into being a MySQL DBA. I got into DevOps / AWS between 2008 - 2014 -- AWS, EC2, Chef, Puppet, etc. -- but took a break to run a side business outside the industry, which ended up turning into the last 10 years of my life.
 There was a software component to my side business, and I&#x27;ve kept up with some small consulting projects, so the skills I had are still sharp, but I haven&#x27;t kept up as much on what&#x27;s new.
 I remain pretty well-versed in MySQL/Postgres (RDS/Aurora/otherwise) and AWS in general, though I&#x27;m not certified. Bash skills are still solid, Python skills are not. My Ruby skills are decent, but no Node experience.
 My original plan was to take a Kubernetes course. I generally figure things out pretty quickly. But with the changing landscape -- salaries, everything being AI -- I&#x27;m wondering what I should focus on next. I&#x27;m probably going to be looking for a full time job come September, and wondering where I should spend most of my time. AWS Bedrock? Kubernetes? Learning how to build LLMs? Teaching myself Node &amp; Python?
 Appreciate any feedback anyone can provide.
 Also curious if people feel that being physically in the Bay Area can hurt or help your chances of finding work. I have the option to move there.
 TLDR: Great at bash, awk &amp; sed; decent at CloudFormation, but just learned what kubectl was yesterday.

                              <span>So my background is like 6 years of all over the place work and training. Help desk, network admin, security analyst, sys admin, info sec manager. 
 My bachelors is in IT and my masters is in cybersecurity. I recently started working with the dev team at my company in a devops role. I’m building docker images, automating their builds using gitlab-ci and kaniko, threw in some SAST and container scanning with acceptance criteria, then using azure app service to deploy, wrote some firewall rules. 
 Kinda just learning on the go but absolutely loving it. And I’m the kind of person when I dive into something I dive in with both feet. So I’m flying through KodeKloud in my spare time, learning Kubernetes, getting stronger devops concepts, getting more proficient with Linux and bash scripting. I’m doubling down by using code academy to learn some basics in web development, (already knew basic python syntax) gonna start building a web app with a flask backend. Then for fun I was gonna deploy my own web app with a database in my minikube lab. Maybe host the database in the cloud and make them communicate securely just to make my environment more realistic. 
 all this while still working with the team at work and applying things im learning to my work. 
 Nothing seems extremely hard. like it&#x27;s a ton to learn, but absolutely not impossible. but then i come here and everyone talks like if you didnt start as a software developer youre gonna be useless in devops. i understand im still extremely new in my journey, and i already have a good background in fundamentals so maybe its coming easier to me then a random guy that googled “high paying jobs”, but am i wrong to think i can be good in the field? This sub constantly has me feeling like im wasting my time and no company will ever take me seriously because I don’t know how to leetcode. Hell I’m even willing to learn how to leetcode lmao. I just enjoy this so much more than anything iv done so far and want to succeed.

 Right now it&#x27;s a whole bunch of throwing dead cats over the fence at each other, and servers running end of life operating systems because the devs refuse to move their applications. The infrastructure team is capable of building them a server within a couple hours but then getting the app moved becomes an ordeal, and then this stacks up and stacks up.

                              <span>I took a Docker course that went over these topics. After finishing it, I was able to understand essentially most of what&#x27;s covered in this roadmap on a fundamental level. 
 However, I&#x27;m not sure how much deeper knowledge I should have for each of those topics, especially for a job. For example, I know how to build docker images using Docker Compose and push them onto DockerHub. I understand how networking works and how to setup persistent volume storage. Would you say this is adequate knowledge for a DevOps role, or should I dive deeper into certain topics? If the latter, what more should I focus on? 
 And considering Kubernetes is quite complicated to learn and grasp, I&#x27;m not sure if I should dive deeper into certain things in Docker or move on and focus on Kubernetes?

                              <span>I got inspired by Microsoft Viva Insights and decided to create my own version, leveraging Prometheus. This turned out to be a great reason to learn some Go! As such, I&#x27;m happy to share my first software project. 
 Please check out Focus Exporter. A tool that helps track metrics related to focused windows, user activity, and meeting durations on Windows.
 Focus Exporter surfaces data about time spent in various applications, including meetings on Microsoft Teams and Zoom. The metrics are exposed via a Prometheus http endpoint, which can be integrated into existing monitoring setups.
 Features:
  
Tracking focused-window metrics
 Monitoring activity/inactivity
 Measuring meeting durations
 Privacy mode for sensitive window titles
 Configurable through command-line parameters
  
check it out on GitHub: Focus Exporter
 Feedback and suggestions are welcome, this is a learning project for me!

                              <span>Holy shit... I&#x27;m doing so bad on them....
 I can do the job, I got promoted to senior after 5 years, then team lead on a team of 4 people at a decently big company. I get good feedback so... it SEEMS like I can... do this goddamn job.
 But I got laid off in Jan and while I&#x27;m getting interviews... I am bombing them pretty hard.
 I&#x27;m not even getting past the hiring manager behavioral round. I just sound so stupid during interviews. I can&#x27;t communicate well what I&#x27;ve done. It&#x27;s not even that they&#x27;re being assholes... it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m really screwing this up.
 I think I&#x27;m getting better. I started taking friends&#x27; advice and following the STAR responses. I&#x27;ve been writing down my interview answers. And I&#x27;ve passed 3 out of 5 of my last 5 interviews....
 Now I&#x27;m up to the LC rounds now and I bombed 2 out of 3. Even though they were questions I knew exactly how to do... I just blanked out and didn&#x27;t talk through my answers.
 Out of the 1 interview I have left (round 3), I have system design on Monday. I fully expect to fucking blank and bomb it too, even though I&#x27;ve done sys design at work for years...
 This interview process is very stressful. I have coworkers who were laid off with me, who have gotten offers after only 3 interviews.... I am doing so poorly on this.
 I already screwed up 8 companies out of 9 (last one ongoing on Monday).... I don&#x27;t wanna do like 50 of these.
 How many have you guys bombed?

                              <span>The situation is kind of weird but in a nutshell, tech lead and I (senior level) are friends from college (he’s 3 years older) so we went out for a drink after work one day and he was teasing me a bit about being online more often while doing remote work, something like “dude you be slaking off too much on remote Fridays” (so I can get promoted to staff).
 Somehow, this conversation gets heard by someone in management and after some weird stuff goes on I get put on pip. I talked to the tech lead about it and he was very apologetic to me and mad at management. 
 Recently, I got an offer for the same level at a F100 fintech firm that’s also 3 days in office and slightly better benefits along with 10k more base salary and a comparable bonus structure. I’m super mad at management so I’m thinking about just quitting on Monday with no notice but maybe I’ll screw over my friend a bit too much. Thoughts?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I switched to linux 2 yrs ago. I have being using Ubuntu and Fedora and now I think I would have fun setting up Arch on my laptop. The only things I know about Arch are the memes &quot;I use Arch btw&quot; and about how hard it is to configure it, so I wanted to know how true they are. My only concern is that right now I&#x27;m working on my master thesis, so I need my laptop ASAP. Is it really that tedious to configure Arch? Would it take more then a day to have it fully functional?

                              <span>Hi guys, I have an arch setup with KDE, wayland and a nvidia GPU. I just updated all the system with &quot;pacman -Syu&quot; and got the new 6.9.1 linux version, but now I have wayland completely broken. I tried to follow again the arch wiki (in particular the &quot;DRM kernel mode setting&quot;) and this time it didn&#x27;t work. Following the guide (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA#DRM\_kernel\_mode\_setting, chapter 1.3) the command &quot;cat /sys/module/nvidia_drm/parameters/modeset&quot; give me &quot;Y&quot; which is right.
 For now I&#x27;m switching (again) to X11 but this is bad for me because KDE works better on wayland.
 Can someone help me understand what to do? Thanks a lot.
 P.S.
 Nvidia Driver Version: 550.78
 P.P.S.
 NOW IT WORKS. Really thanks for all your help. The solution was to set the /etc/modprobe.d/ file with „options nvidia-drm modeset&#x3D;1“ and adding below a new line with: „options nvidia-drm fbdev&#x3D;1“
 Really thanks

                              <span>Running sudo pacman -Syu gives the following error:
 warning: cannot resolve &quot;libicui18n.so&#x3D;75-64&quot;, a dependency of &quot;thunderbird&quot; warning: cannot resolve &quot;libicuuc.so&#x3D;75-64&quot;, a dependency of &quot;thunderbird&quot; :: The following package cannot be upgraded due to unresolvable dependencies: thunderbird 
 Steps I have tried so far
  
Change mirrors 
 
Uninstall Thunderbird 
 
Try to re-install thunderbird (gives the same error)
 
 How do I fix this issue?
 Thank you for your time

                              <span>I&#x27;ve done some python but Go is my first compiled and statically typed language. I&#x27;m curious to know why The Go Programming Language book by Kern and Don say this is safe (and I&#x27;m sure it is). But what does that mean? If I have a pointer for a local var then I guess that is an address in the stack frame, when I return that stack frame will be gone and might get overwritten with a new function call. So I just want to know what is happening to make it safe. 
 Does the basic variable have to go to the heap? I thought primitives could be assigned to the stack and reference types have to go to the heap since primitives normally get returned by value. But here, if we are taking the address of a primitive would it get sent to the heap?
 I&#x27;m a bit out of my depth so an ELI5 would be helpful of sorts

                              <span>I&#x27;m already working on this subject but I&#x27;m open to more resources and explanations.
 What are the key differences between pointers in Go and C, and why are these differences important?
 I understand that pointers in C allow for direct memory manipulation and can lead to security issues. How do pointers in Go differ in terms of usage and safety? Why are these differences significant for modern programming?

                              <span>Steam DB says that roughly 9000 indie games are released yearly. That means an indie game gets released about every hour.
 Imagine your indie game is a penny that you’re throwing into a fountain with 9000 other Pennie’s in it already. What hope do you or I have to be found? Even if you polished your game to the T. If you took your penny to a workshop and polished it like it was a 24 carrot diamond. The odds that someone finds your really shiny penny are demoralizingly slim.
 It is so hard to work on my game knowing this. The feeling is like I’m crafting a super intricate cotton candy boat that I’m ultimately going to put in a river that will immediately dissolve my years of hard work.
 Should I just abandon the idea of making a game altogether? How do you get past the idea that almost certainly your game will die on launch?

 Altough &quot;really good&quot; is subjective, I need &quot;really good&quot; games that sold less than 20k copies on Steam. 
 If you know any game that seems really good, and don&#x27;t sold very well, please share with me.

About Me:
 I&#x27;ve been doing prototypes and working with unity for the past 7 years(off and on), never released anything prior to this so before I turned 41 I wanted to get something out there. I spent 1.25 year (hobbyist approach) on this title. Got laid off in the last 5 months of development so was able to put a little bit more time to polish prior to release (but the honey due list really sidetracked what I thought I could allocate to it).
  
Numbers:
  
Out of pocket costs: $800
 Units sold: ~4500
 Reviews: 96% positive 117 user reviews (not counting keys)
 Wishlists into EA: 4.5k
 Wishlists Outstanding 1 month into EA release: 14k
 Conversion 10.9%
 Return rate: 7.9%

                              <span>I’m an indie dev and I struggle so hard with things like foliage, lighting, 4K texture streaming, without lowering my FPS or putting everything in 2K quality. I understand big gaming companies have a lot of money and resources, but it just baffles me that they can put together such a good looking game. For context I use UE5 for all my projects; have a 4090 RTX, super high quality monitors, and 16GB ram. As soon as I start adding foliage to a large, somewhat open world, my FPS slows down like crazy. To the point that I have to choose trees over grass sometimes as an example. I use LODs, low draw distance, but it doesn’t seem to help. I don’t know how a big company like Ubisoft can throw that much high quality foliage in their game alongside exceptional lighting without destroying the games performance? If any of you work for a company like this can you shed some light on this for me?? I am hoping to build higher quality forests in my game without tanking my FPS and maintaining 4K textures.

                              <span>I have a simple singly linked list, where each node has a next pointer to the next node, and a data pointer to whatever the consumer wants to point to. I want the same linked list implementation to be able to hold both function pointers and data pointers.
 Since void pointers are not allowed to be converted to function pointers in the C standard (I think since processors with Harvard architectures can store instructions and data differently?), my current solution is to create two wrapper structs, one for instruction and data pointers respectively, and then have the linked list node point to the wrapper. 
 Is this the simplest way to go about things? Here are some things I thought about:
  
Section 2.12.3 of the POSIX standard (PDF) says that function pointers should be safely convertible to void pointers and back, but I want to make my program portable to non-POSIX systems if I can help it.
 I thought about simply having a void pointer which could either point to a data pointer or a function pointer, instead of having the struct wrapper. But I don&#x27;t think this works because we would need to allocate space for the function pointer to live, and malloc only returns void pointers, so we get back to the same problem.
 I could simply having two implementations of a linked list, one that holds function pointers and another that holds data pointers, but I want to share as much code as possible.

 I understand you can do stuff like char *ptr; int *ptr; etc But why? Im not good with ptrs, i dont understand them well, but why do we point to another address or store another address, i just dont understand the use case for them

                              <span>Hello,
 I am trying to comiple and build a c-project that I downloaded, by running the make file that came with the project. I did not add or modify anything.
 I tried with terminal in VSCode and Windows Powershell and MSYS2, with the same results.
  
C:\qp\qtools/gnu_arm-none-eabi/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc -c -g -mcpu&#x3D;cortex-m0plus -mthumb -Wall -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -O -I.. -I../../../include -I../../../3rd_party/CMSIS/Include -I../../../3rd_party/nucleo-c031c6 -DSTM32C031xx main.c -o dbg/main.o
 main.c:2:10: fatal error: miros.h: No such file or directory
 2 | #include &quot;miros.h&quot;
  
If I put all the files in the root directory it builds fine. What am I doing wrong?
 Thank you
 The directory structure is:
  
My_Project/
 +---3rd_party/ - third-party software (needed in the examples)
 | +---CMSIS/ - ARM CMSIS
 | +---ek-tm4c123gxl/ - low-level code to support EK-TM4C123GX board
 | +---nucleo-c031c6/ - low-level code to support STM32 NUCLEO LC031C6 board
  
   
 +---include/ - include directory
 | miros.h - MiROS API
 | assert.h
 +---src/ - MiROS source code
 | +---gnu/
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
The relevant makefile code is:
 #----------------------------------------------------------------------------- # project name # PROJECT :&#x3D; project #----------------------------------------------------------------------------- # project directories # # list of all source directories used by this project VPATH &#x3D; \ .. \ ../../../src/gnu \ ../../../3rd_party/nucleo-c031c6 \ ../../../3rd_party/nucleo-c031c6/gnu # list of all include directories needed by this project INCLUDES &#x3D; \ -I.. \ -I../../../include \ -I../../../3rd_party/CMSIS/Include \ -I../../../3rd_party/nucleo-c031c6 #----------------------------------------------------------------------------- # files # # assembler source files ASM_SRCS :&#x3D; # C source files C_SRCS :&#x3D; \ main.c \ bsp.c \ miros.c \ system_stm32c0xx.c \ startup_stm32c031xx.c

                              <span>I am having a 2024 problem. The issue is that the VS Code console I use to run the code, aka the compiler, does not work as intended for the C exercises in the book. As you may be aware, things like backspace or the EOF is not something that the compiler in VS Code will let me handle, it just handles these things on its own, hence I can&#x27;t actually check for EOF or a backspace. This is obviously a problem when it comes to these examples and exercises. 
 The question is what are my alternatives here? I want to run this in old c compiler as the book intended without dealing with something way too old and hard to navigate, or like a keyboard-only interface. If its important, I am working in Windows.

 but not here (even with -checks&#x3D;&quot;*&quot;):
 #include  int main(){ malloc(1); int a[10]; for(int i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; 10; i++) a[i] &#x3D; i; } 
 I believe that clion was able to catch the second one the last time I tried

 (Above code prints out the proper string, so feeds_temp[j][k], strlen is correct also)
 strncpy(channel_feeds_temp[j][k], feeds_temp[j+1][k], strlen(feeds_temp[j+1][k]));
 feeds_temp[j][k][strlen(feeds_temp[j+1][k])] &#x3D; &#x27;\0&#x27;;

 printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, feeds_temp[j+1][k]);
 strncpy(feeds_temp[j+1][k], temp_string, strlen(temp_string));
 feeds_temp[j+1][k][strlen(temp_string)] &#x3D; &#x27;\0&#x27;;
 printf(&quot;%s\n\n&quot;, feeds_temp[j+1][k]);
 (This does not, so both printfs here are the same string, i expected after the strncpy it to be the same as the temp_string)
 So the last strncpy here does not effect the feeds_temp[j+1][k], the printfs before and after are the same
 SOLVED: i made the temporary string be a char pointer to the original string and then when changeing the original string i forgot that i also change the contents of the temporary string

 What is clang doing there? I&#x27;m trying to run gcc, and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s been doing just fine so far?

                              <span>I am quite a novice C programmer and one of the biggest difficulties in my C journey so far has been learning how to design APIs (functions, structures, typedefs..).
 I&#x27;m taking a course focused on learning C from the bottom up and we are very discouraged from using the standard library in our code, but encouraged to write our own implementations, unless it&#x27;s for functions that map directly to syscalls or if it&#x27;s a tremendous task to do so, like malloc.. 
 What it made me realize is that it&#x27;s very hard for me to come up with good designs, even for small problems, coming up with the right data structures, the right functions that don&#x27;t take like 5+ parameters, &quot;keeping things simple&quot; as to say, is actually not easy. 
 So, I was wondering if some of you had principles or advice that helped them write &quot;good&quot; APIs, I know it&#x27;s quite a vague and subjective topic but I honestly feel like there has to be some core principles and guidelines that can help. 
 At least I can speak for myself and say I reviewed some code I wrote a few months ago and thought to myself, why did I write this in such a convoluted way? And most certainly, I am still doing that right now, not even realizing it.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m trying to find a way to increase the speed of a for loop, that that gets executed hundreds of times - what would be the most efficient way, if I don&#x27;t want to use vectors (because from my testing, using them as the range for a FOR loop is inefficient).

                              <span>Just started my programming course and I have to submit this assignment tomorrow. Keeping things short... I need to round up values to two digits after the &quot;.&quot; but keeping 4 digits after the &quot;.&quot; Eg: $18.6784 should be $18.6800.
 For this I am writing Taxes &#x3D; sub_total * TAX Printf(&quot;Taxes. :$%.4f\n&quot;, Total);
 I am not here just for the result, if someone could explain so I can learn I will be appreciated :)

                              <span>Problem (1): The code below uses the following struct: struct Data 1{ struct Data *data1; int data2; int *data3; }; typedef struct Data Data;
 In the code below, declarations for d1, d2, and d3 are missing. (Recall that a variable declaration gives the type and tells the compiler about a variable; e.g., int n; would declare the variable n.) Each of a1 and d2 have one of the following types: Data, Data, and/or Data * First, write three lines of code declaring variables d1, d2, and d3. Then, draw a memory diagram, including clearly differentiating between the stack and the heap, for the snippet of code shown below. d1.data2 &#x3D; 10; d2 &#x3D; malloc (sizeof (Data)) ; (d2) .data1 &#x3D; &amp;d1; d2-&gt;data2 &#x3D; d1. data2; d1. data1 &#x3D; d2; d1. data3 &#x3D; malloc (sizeof (int)) ; * (d.data3) &#x3D; 7; d2-›data3 &#x3D; d1. data3; d3 &#x3D; &amp; (d2→&gt;data3) ; I think my answer for the first problem is Data d1; Data d2; int** d3; correct me if I’m wrong but could someone please help with the diagram?

                              <span>A short time ago I wrote a gameboy (color) emulator that is working for the most part and runs stable. I just wanted to ask you what your average cpu usage is? Mine uses Vulkan and Imgui and I implemented multithreading. Hardware on one thread, the gui, basic control logic and swapchain stuff runs on the main thread, two for audio processing (one for filling a ringbuffer and the callback for SDL audio output) and another thread for uploading commandbuffers from a queue to trigger the texture upload to the GPU VRAM etc. It&#x27;s running at roughly 30-35% CPU usage on a 5800x3d. Should I consider optimizing some stuff or is this relatively normal? There is some other stuff going on in the background because I added a debugger, memory observer etc.
 The memory footprint is relatively small, roughly 200MB when running pokemon crystal, 30MB in the menu (no game running)

                              <span>I am currently programming my NES emulator and so far everything is pretty straight forward. I simply emulate every single instruction on my virtual nes and so far it works pretty well. At least in terms of performance.
 But I can&#x27;t see this approach working for larger machines like the Wii U. Do they translate the assembly, or are they generating some intermediate code that is executed by a virtual machine? I doubt that every single instruction is emulated like on my NES emulator. I can&#x27;t imagine that this is performant. But maybe I&#x27;m wrong. It would be really interesting to know what black magic is used in those emulators.

                              <span>The time it takes to reach vblank is seconds which is obviously too slow. I decided to output the time it takes for the main loop to iterate once and it&#x27;s ~2000ns which is much larger than the 238ns needed for a single cpu &amp; ppu cycle.
 I decided to time my code even when the main loop does no work via:
 while (app.running) { QueryPerformanceCounter(&amp;end_time); delta_time &#x3D; static_cast(end_time.QuadPart - start_time.QuadPart); delta_time *&#x3D; 1e9; // nanosecond precision delta_time /&#x3D; frequency.QuadPart; printf(&quot;delta time: %f\n&quot;, delta_time); start_time &#x3D; end_time; } 
 This made no magnitude change to the time which leads me to think that I need to calculate how many cycles have occurred between each iteration (~84) and simulate them.
 Before I go about implementing the above I wanted to check that this is the correct approach?

 To give a brief summary: 
  
The manager is coming back after a longer time of absence to the team they lead before
 
3 members of the team (myself included) had to seek professional psychiatric help to deal with anxiety, stress, panic attacks and all the other shit we were put through because of the manager. One teammate had to take extended leave to deal with the mental health issues caused by the manager. 
 
2 devs left the company specifically naming the manager as a reason why are they leaving
 
We had &quot;secret&quot; mandatory overtime &quot;which every team is doing&quot; which turned out to be bullshit and against company policies

                              <span>Personally, I like to run things with zero team building and socialization happening during the work day. I also don&#x27;t like meetings that aren&#x27;t directly feeding into meeting some objective or satisfying some stakeholders needs. I also like everything be fully remote. 
 So no team building lunches, games, axe throwing, board game night, etc. No stand ups, no weekly team meetings, etc. Retros are async, design meetings and discussions are scheduled as required around specific topics, and I do optional 15m one on ones with people who like that environment for asking questions or giving feedback. People pair on work when they want, but they can also work alone if they want. Basically just trusting staff to work how they want and achieve whatever is most urgent or needed, and flag stuff when it isn&#x27;t clear.
 The result I have found is that people on the team can do 4 or 5 hours of work on their own schedule and exceed the output of teams doing +8 hours work in office. So of course I am happy with people taking this extra time and using it for their own purposes.
 However, I know some people really feel like these kinds of team building activities are important for building team cohesion. So, experienced devs, do you prefer to have more team building type meetings and higher contract with your coworkers, such as being in office sometimes and more opportunities to just meet and chat? Or do you prefer this to only be &quot;as needed&quot; as I have tended towards?

                              <span>Dear Rustaceans,
 My dream is to build a secure, fast &amp; cross platform electronic medical record system - I am very keen to learn how to program much more and build towards this. I have not written any Rust code (my limited experience is in javascript &amp; python), but I really love the features of Rust.
 How realistic is my proposal? Is the Rust environment mature enough for such a project? I see sufficient development work and full stack applications being developed, large companies are already using it, there were several articles about govn bodies in USA advising moving to rust from other “low level” programming languages. 
 I want to start with the smallest standalone healthcare niche I can find &amp; I have several candidate systems in mind (think of it as one small largely self contained system - which will need to communicate with other legacy healthcare systems if deployed.
 So is the rust environment mature enough for me to try this? Im nervous as I know I am junior &amp; I sadly am always short on time.
 If this is an unacceptable post please down vote - tell me why and I will happily delete. 
 P.s. I love this corner of reddit

                              <span>As a side project, I had the idea of writing an alternative implementation of core and std (I just want to learn how they work inside and get a feel of it).
 However I have seen that unsafe rust is frowned upon (maybe my impression so please correct me if I am wrong) and rewriting these libraries is quite literally impossible without unsafe.
 So am I allowed to use them here under the reason that these libraries can&#x27;t be written without unsafe?

Just pick some of them: 1. selectors, I don&#x27;t know what it is exactly, but when I read through the user guide, it is said that this is not available in Rust 2. Some handy functions, like describe or approx_n_unique are also missing.

                              <span>Disclaimer: It&#x27;s not really hacking, but I couldn&#x27;t find a sub fitting more for my question.
 Hello everyone, I am wondering where IntelX and Google&#x27;s darkweb monitoring service are getting their lesser known / private leaks? For an example, there is a site called selfstore.hu, an sql dump from their site can be found both on IntelX and Google&#x27;s darkweb monitoring service but not on any other leak search engine site, only on those two. So where do they get those? Is there some clearner or darkweb forum where people randomly post these for credits (Similary to BreachForums) or just for bragging?
 I want to point out again, these are not from BreachForums. I also tried to look it up in DHT search engines, but I got zero results.
 I appreciate the answers, have a nice day :)

                              <span>The second key recovery vector outlined in the Gone in 360 seconds paper by F Garcia et al, implemented by Kev Sheldrake in RFIDLer 2017, now work in Proxmark3. 
 It is a time/trade memory attack, with a online part and a secondary offline part.
 We can now gather the 2048 bits of crypto key stream needed for the second part of the attack in the pm3 client. 
 You all need to create the 1.2tb lookup database file in order to execute the offline part of the attack.

                              <span>My wife has not been able to play a game for a few weeks due to bad development. I&#x27;ve reviewed the crash logs generated by game, and it appears there is one particular item, a fountain, that is placed in her game that is causing the crash. The profile.json is encrypted, so I can&#x27;t just go in there and find that entry and remove it. I&#x27;m guessing it uses AES encryption since the crash log mentions Rijndael. What would the best approach be to digging for the key? I&#x27;ve opened up files with ghidra, but for some reason, findcrypt isn&#x27;t showing up for me to use in analysis. My wife loves this game and I really want to figure this out for her. Is there a better approach to doing this?

My insecurities are made worse by the highly elitistic developer community and by the fact that it is becoming increasingly difficult to get a job in CS. Even web development, which used to be &quot;easy&quot; to get into, is now pretty hard to get into if you don&#x27;t have a CS degree, which I don&#x27;t.
 I am pretty bad at my job and I constantly have to ask for help. I ask for help from both the team that I work with and my boyfriend, who is also a web developer. What makes it worse is that I already have 2 years of experience and I can&#x27;t build simple stuff by myself without asking for help. I feel like I am annoying everyone around me, and I feel like shit because I can barely write 3 lines of code by myself. It really doesn…</span>

                              <span>I have a project in mind that i don&#x27;t want just slam in and code it up as i think of what to do, I&#x27;d like to have a roadmap that I can dedicate time to think of the class, interfaces, class inheritance and dependencies, pseudocode functions all that sort of stuff, in an easier overview to think over and plan ahead of writing code.
 Like planning to have database access modules that are span up on the fly by a load balancer that hears for api calls from a business logic server module that sort of overview planning, in a visual format that can be edited as things evolve.
 I&#x27;ve tried Obsidian notes for markdown support can make pretty interesting webpage looking notes and has some addons that help in diagram making, as well as mindmap type apps that often have clunky controls, or Figma that can make a mockup of a webpage or interface with interactions.
 Personally I prefer the mindmap codeblock look to quickly draw connections between encapsulated functionality that I need to implement, then break them down into components which go into the interface interactions with an api, internal routing to module&#x27;s logic etc. I consider it pre-documentation.
 What&#x27;s your favorite app for this sort of mapping and planning?
 edit: many options were suggested throughout the thread its great check it out. Wanted to share that I settled on obsidian.md with excalidraw addon, heres a video talking about it!

 Should I watch project tutorials on YouTube and copy them to learn to code my own projects?

 My GPA is not among the outstanding ones (4.3/5); I am from one of the IITs in India.
 Q1. Should aim for such positions, given my GPA
 Q2. Should I focus on Competitive Programming or not
 Q3. Is this the *complete* list of topics I should be familiar with for the interviews?
 * Computer Networks
 * Computer Architecture
 * Operating Systems
 * Compilers

                              <span>Hi! As far as I can tell, the Intel C++ compiler, icpx, does not support anything in the  header. Specifically, I&#x27;d like to use std::endian in my project. Here is an example that fails with icpx -std&#x3D;c++23. It works with gcc-13.2.0 and clang-17. It is a bit confusing becasue the compiler uses the GCC library which does support this feature. Feature description and search for std::endian.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 include 
 include 
 int main() { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello, World!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; if (std::endian::native &#x3D;&#x3D; std::endian::big_endian) std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Native is big endian&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; else if (std::endian::native &#x3D;&#x3D; std::endian::little_endian) std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Native is little endian&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I&#x27;m being pressured by management to use the Intel compiler for &quot;customer support&quot; reasons. But this is a four year old feature that doesn&#x27;t compile... Is supporting the Intel compiler a bad idea?
 EDIT: Thanks to /u/pdimov2 it seems like this was some sort of an issue with my local compiler as it does work in Godbolt.

 Something like written by industry experts, that includes how thousands of people may have died due to mistakes caused by C++ developer(s).
 I don&#x27;t care how big the textbook is. Internet is full of fragmented information on this and you&#x27;re never sure what else you&#x27;re missing.
 I feel it would be tragedy if somebody hasn&#x27;t yet written a book on this.

                              <span>As title, I&#x27;m trying to migrate my teams current .sln/.vcxproj codebase into a CMake build system.
 There is one &quot;top-level&quot; .sln file that will build all the child projects into relevant .lib/.dlls or .exe files. With the final output being a collection of .lib/dll and a few .exe files for deployment.
 I&#x27;ve read that CMakePresets.json should be in the top level, however because I want the ability to build each subproject separately, should I give each a CMakePresets.json?
 Below it a rough project outline I&#x27;ve proposed. Is there a better solution for this project outline?
 Additionally, can a top level CMakePresets.json overwrite children - a Directory.Build.props file in a .sln build system can overwrite child config.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I built llvm, clang and libc++ on a rocky linux machine (the host compiler is g++ 11.3.1) by using the following options:
 cmake -S llvm -B build -G Ninja -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS&#x3D;&#x27;clang&#x27; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE&#x3D;Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX&#x3D;&#x27;/home/test/local&#x27; -DENABLE_RUNTIMES&#x3D;&#x27;libcxx;libcxxabi;libunwind&#x27; -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD&#x3D;X86 -DLLVM_TARGET_TRIPLE&#x3D;&#x27;x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu&#x27; -DLIBCXX_INSTALL_MODULES&#x3D;ON
 Everything worked OK (or so it seemed) but when I try compile a simple program like the following:
 import std; 
 int main() {
 std::vector v;
 }
 using xmake with the following setup xmake.lua:
 target(&quot;test1&quot;) set_kind(&quot;binary&quot;) set_languages(&quot;c++23&quot;) set_policy(&quot;build.c++.modules&quot;, true) 
 I get the following error:
 error: module dependency std required for src/main.cpp not found
 Whereas, everything works ok on my homebrew installed llvm 18.1.5 on an Apple Silicon. What am I missing ?

                              <span>So I created a single-header message-passing library.
 http://github.com/gamblevore/picomsg
 I use it myself, and it works well for my needs.
 The reason I created it, is because I couldn&#x27;t find any that were small. For example there is MPI, but it is huge and complex. For certain people (me) this is a problem.
 For example, you might want to create a small program that does a lot of things. If you need to include only a few large components, like a compression lib, a message-passing lib, maybe a XML/JSON parser, and each one takes 1MB, now you have a 3MB program, but your code might only take 50KB. It just seems wrong.
 To many people this isn&#x27;t an issue, but to some of us, its either something we do for fun, or an obsession. Not sure which. But there can be practical needs too, such as c…</span>

                              <span>I have little C++ experience so please bear with me. This program outputs the following. My question is how did the &quot;destroy local&quot; line get called? I would expect tmp to replace the variable &quot;c&quot; which contains &quot;local&quot; so how did the string survive the move?
 If it got called earlier that would make sense but not at the end like that. My only guess is the the variable must have got copied before the assignment but seems like it defeats the purpose of the operator. Please help me understand. :)
 Output: construct local construct tmp move assignment tmp destroy tmp destroy local &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; #include  class MyClass { public: std::string name; public: MyClass(const char* in_name) { name &#x3D; in_name; printf(&quot;construct %s\n&quot;, name.c_str()); } ~MyClass() { printf(&quot;destroy %s\n&quot;, name.c_str()); } MyClass(const MyClass &amp;t) {} MyClass &amp;operator &#x3D;(MyClass &amp;&amp;t) { printf(&quot;move assignment %s\n&quot;, t.name.c_str()); return t; } }; int main() { MyClass c(&quot;local&quot;); c &#x3D; MyClass(&quot;tmp&quot;); return 0; }

 Which one do you use? If vectors, what&#x27;s the point of having new/delete too?

                              <span>Right, so I know Qt exists, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure how sensible relying on it would be. The key point is that I definitely don&#x27;t need a gigantic swiss army knife GUI framework, I only need the basic stuff - simple layout, a couple of basic widgets, rudimentary window support. Think basic Win32 - toolbars with buttons, menus, some configuration windows with lists and checkboxes, that sort of stuff. Having &quot;native&quot; looking UI (whatever that means these days) is of no concern.
 The important visual bit of the program is going to be a vector based data visualizer and it needs to be very snappy, have very clean looking rendering and very smooth zooming. That&#x27;s the most challenging bit, I think. As for basic GUI, I&#x27;ve actually made a basic sketch of a GUI builder of sorts a while ago in Lua (just by relying on the existing pixel drawing function and font rendering) and I didn&#x27;t find it overly difficult.
 The main issues are that I&#x27;m unfamiliar with Cpp (I do have some experience with C, I still remember it fairly well), and I&#x27;m going to be developing on Windows while having no idea how much work it&#x27;ll take to build and distribute it on OSX until I&#x27;ve actually progressed a good deal.
 As far as general GUI multiplatform development goes... I dunno, I&#x27;ve spent a great deal of time researching the subject and it seems that no silver bullet exists, not even remotely. Every option has serious cons and issues. Qt, Java, countless web-based frameworks, and then of course every language has its cons too. For instance, I&#x27;ve been tinkering with Dear PyGui lately (Python bindings for ImGui) and Python doesn&#x27;t seem to have a good distribution system to end users.

                              <span>Found a 700+ GB file in ~/.cache
 I was running a browser and a vm, and all of a sudden, everything errored out and started giving me storage alerts.
 I checked my file browser (KDE and Filelight), and I found a file with a big name that was growing in size by the GB&#x27;s
 Here&#x27;s an excerpt using ncdu:
  ncdu 2.4 ~ Use the arrow keys to navigate, press ? for help --- /home//.cache --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 727.9 GiB [########################] tmpef8jp_a3_kW2Fvj6kL.epgrTfsRE7Vs_L1FetLLSyQ1psgMXucqGcORL46tJe...3QS27_NNVFetA1y9RKT6r3j5mSR_yaDwkqif4E630Z-3daih2Gic1D2NifeAa.y7Z 3.8 GiB [ ] /yay 
 This is not the first time this has happened, but the only time I remember this happening was a year or two ago. 
 Can someone help me figure out what is happening?
 Would a system restart do the trick? Or can I safely delete/rm -rf the file? Due to the sudden bloat, all my browser&#x27;s tabs and current sessions, VMs, and other applications had to be forcefully shut down and restarted. 
 I had to run bleachbit to even get the system to do something, and all cached progress was erased, despite me adding my browsers to an exception list. This has adversely affected my work, and is pretty scary in and of itself, and I would like to avoid such an issue in the future.
 Does anyone have any suggestions, explanations, and/or thoughts on this?
 Update: So, I restarted my PC after about 10 mins and the file was gone. No idea where it came from, and no idea where it went. Thank you for all of your suggestions, I&#x27;ll try them out the next time something like this happens (which is hopefully never).

                              <span>So Arch Linux just merged the Arch Linux Ports RFC recently, with this I suppose developers can now go ahead and work on those ports.
 However, on a recent post (Arch Linux Ports RFC merged!) there was a comment from u/definitely_not_allan saying that a previous RFC (Provide a x86-64-v3 microarchitecture level port) got merged three years ago and nothing happened.
 My question is, why are those ports not happening given that there is enough approval/consensus in the community? Is it a manpower issue at this point? Can users help with the work required to develop those ports?

                              <span>[SOLVED] Today I found that when pipewire is running, pipewire makes my webcam get upside down (I use cheese). When I stop the pipewire service, my webcam behave normally / not upside down. I rarely use webcam but the issue still bother me. Any clue to make pipewire and cheese get along and running together ? Thanks. 
 Edit : I ended up on diving into gnome-video-effect source code and add flip vertical effect (which makes my webcam no more upside down).

                              <span>so, i got an assignement where i should edit an intial code to print &quot;LIBRARY&quot; in the stdout in the correct order, using fork() and wait().
 this is the resulting code:
 #include 
 #include 
 #include  
 int main() {
 printf(&quot;L&quot;);
 if(fork() &#x3D;&#x3D; 0) {
 printf(&quot;I&quot;);
 if(fork() &#x3D;&#x3D; 0) {
 printf(&quot;B&quot;);
 if(fork() &#x3D;&#x3D; 0) {
 printf(&quot;R&quot;);
 } else {
 wait(NULL);
 printf(&quot;A&quot;);
 }
 } else {
 wait(NULL);
 printf(&quot;R&quot;);
 }
 } else {
 wait(NULL);
 printf(&quot;Y&quot;);
 if(fork() &#x3D;&#x3D; 0) {
 printf(&quot;!&quot;);
 }
 }
 return 0;
 }
 from the above code i got:
 LIBRLIBALIRLYLY!
 which is weird. why the letter B (and other letters) printed so many times instead of once.
 this behavior is changing when adding \n after each character in printf(), like that:
 printf(&quot;A\n&quot;); 
 and then i got:
 L
 I
 B
 R
 A
 R
 Y
 !
 i really need an explanation
 thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi all, can someone explain how binary protocol works in C? From transferring data from server to client &amp; vise versa. Ive seem some examples that look crazy confusing. Then ive also seen someone say the easist way is to send as a struct &amp; recv as a struct &amp; use htons &amp; htonl to convert etc. is that called binary also?

                              <span>I work with C and I have to say, when the topic of how everything is put together when you run a C program comes up, my brain kind of shuts off. I hear mystical terms like linking, compiling, translation units, object files, libraries, headers, includes, etc. etc. and I can&#x27;t say I have even a decent understanding of any of this. I&#x27;m currently working on a task related to a build system that I&#x27;m trying to wrap my head around and am thinking my lack of understanding of the fundamentals of how a C program is compiled is a big hindrance. I&#x27;d love to dive into this topic to bring up my level of understanding. Any suggestions for books, videos, blogs, or whatever else would be greatly appreciated :)

                              <span>What do you guys think about macro metaprogamming? There&#x27;s a lot of it in klib and the c implementation of abseil&#x27;s swiss table does some pretty wicked stuff with it (this specifically). Just wondering what the general thoughts of macro metaprogramming are.

 int a, b; printf(&quot;enter nums: &quot;); scanf(&quot;%d %d&quot;, &amp;a, &amp;b); printf(&quot;%d, %d&quot;, a, b); 
 I get this problem:
 C:\...\&gt; enter nums: 0 0 C:\...\&gt; 
 The space in between is just the program pausing for around 3 seconds, and then it just ends?
 What is going on, and how to fix?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I am on Windows and I program a little in C.
 I have tried programming in VScode but I didn’t like the extensions and clicking a button to “run” the code without it creating a real executable. Felt like something artificial to me. Also I didn’t find info about how to make it so that you can create an executable (maybe I didn’t search enough).
 So I’ve installed WSL and I’m thinking about writing the code in Notepad++ and then compiling it with gcc in the WSL. It feels to me like I have control over the program that way, in terms of compiling, linking, maybe makefile etc..
 What do you guys think? Where do you work?

                              <span>kde + wayland in the middle of game, sudden black screen for a few seconds, then complete loss of sound.
 sound also not coming back,
 tried to switch audio devices - didnt help
 tried to switch to kde x11 - didnt help
 UPDATE: 
  
not restricted to debian same issue on windows 11 ( i dual boot )
 
thinking some sort of Smart TV update ( Hi-Sense Smart TV )
 
changed TV&#x27;s ( Soniq 32 inch Android ) and hdmi cables over sound came back through hdmi cable
 
put Hi-Sense TV and cable on another computer, sound works fine again

                              <span>I need to build a new machine and want a gaming one for some light/casual gaming (Halo and other single player FPSs).
 I have to use Debian stable on the machine. I would really like a GPU that works with little to no effort cause, while I want to occasionally game, I don&#x27;t have time to muck about with things to make it work.
 If it matters/helps, here is the system I am thinking of building: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/HjBQz6.

                              <span>tl;dr - What do you use with THM or HtB to help you remember what they&#x27;ve taught you (specifically when you&#x27;re early on)?
  
I&#x27;ve been doing Try Hack Me for about a month or so. I&#x27;ve done enough to start to get at the meat and potatoes of hacking, but still far from being able to do it on my own.However, I do have a concern. As I&#x27;m continuing my journey on this website, I&#x27;m finding that I&#x27;m forgetting some things. I&#x27;ll know the general idea, but not the exact bits of information I&#x27;d need in the moment.
 I know the default answer to this is just study, but even if I strap myself to a chair and pin my eyelids open like I&#x27;m in Clockwork Orange, I still struggle to remember stuff. I learn best by doing and repetition of the doing, but I&#x27;m not sure what I can use aside from THM and Hack the Box. I&#x27;m still not at a point to be doing an CTF challenges (as far as I know), so those aren&#x27;t really an option.
 What I want to know, is what do you guys use in conjunction with these? I looked at the wiki, and I plan on trying some of them out, but I worry that they&#x27;re going to be too dense/technical for me. Are there any other resources to help familiarize yourself with hacking concepts/tools? Key word being &quot;familiarize&quot;. I&#x27;ve done the lessons, but need reminders before I can fully commit it to memory.
 EDIT: I should mention that I do takes notes as I go through the lessons, and it does help, but it doesn&#x27;t help me full grasp these concepts when it&#x27;s just simple tidbits of information

                              <span>Hey, recently I won a pcb gift card for around 200 bucks, and was wondering if I could use it for a hacking tool. I already made a nfc buisness card, and a macropad so I have some experience in pcb design. I was wondering if there were any hacking projects specifically that can be made using pcb designing. It can be illegal but need to be on the gray line between illegal or legal, just like pwnagotchi. Some ideas that I already have is this https://www.hackster.io/pablotrujillojuan/hackbat-1dfdbc, I would be grateful towards anyone&#x27;s input. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I see this feature used almost everywhere. I personally find it VERY annoying and overused. I never had a moment where I thought it would be better to cram everything into one line.
 So, my question is: would it be fine to not use this feature at all, or would that be considered bad practice?

                              <span>Full Stack fascinates me. The fact that I am control of a fort and if my employer asks me &quot;The gate needs to be changed&quot;, I am &quot;fully&quot; in control of how the gate is changed. These are my skills:
 Front-end: JS, HTML, CSS
 Back-end: Python and Ruby (I dont think Node qualifies as backend?)
 Databases: MySQL, MariaDB, NoSQL and MongoDB.
 During my studies, we had courses which used all of these languages, I am not an expert in them, but I think I can write in each one of them. The problem is not me de-rusting all of these skills, but its that I have no knowledge on connecting them. When I say &quot;connect&quot; I mean pulling data from database and displaying it on the frontend, that might be easy but think about the more difficult things.
 My question to Full Stack devs here is, what did you do to learn to connect everything? For me I learnt JS and Python to an extreme because of summer jobs, but I fear of getting employed as a Full Stack but not really having the knowledge.

                              <span>Hello. I’m currently a high-school student taking a Computer Science course in school, mainly focusing on Python. 
 I have absolutely no background in coding but I had the “dream” of becoming a programmer, so I took the course. 
 I’ve always heard people around me say stuff like “if you’re good at math, you’ll be fine with coding” “You’ll probably like coding since you like math”. It encouraged me to learn how to program but I’m starting to realize now that I absolutely hate programming. My eyes hurt staring at the computer screen for so long, the environment I code in, the lack of support, the amount of errors, plenty of room for mistakes, and it’s just not fun. 
 To be honest..I think the money is what I saw of becoming a programmer. Hence I forced myself to code and lied to myself that I enjoy this. 
 I like problem-solving in math and looking for errors in my solution when my answer is wrong, but with programming…it’s just not the same—at least for me. 
 Am I just not smart enough for programming? I’m starting to doubt my math skills and critical thinking abilities. I feel so stupid when coding.
 Edit; sorry if this sounds like a rant. I’m frustrated and stressed with this final assignment

 sorry for asking but I want to create my first emulator

                              <span>I have hit a wall in troubleshooting my Gameboy emulator, and seek this community’s expertise.
 I have been using Gameboy Doctor (which uses Blargg’s individual cpu_instrs) and am stuck on Test #7. Specifically, there is a portion where [$EA] A is loaded into (a16) (an address within WRAM), followed by a bunch of loops moving memory between high RAM and WRAM. Then, about 30 instructions later, [$FA] the same portion of WRAM from above is loaded back into A. However, the values are completely different.
 I have checked all opcodes between these, and there is no further modification of this address. My logs and test logs are identical between these. There is no bank swapping, OPCODES themselves look fine, read and write logic looks sound. I am completely out of ideas as to what could be happening here.
 Will post logs when I get home if they are helpful.

                              <span>I have an idea that I have never seen implemented or discussed anywhere and I wonder if it would be possible to do it. I&#x27;m not talking about motion interpolation for 2D video which you hear a lot about these days. I&#x27;m thinking about calculating extra frames by interpolating the 3D coordinates of triangle vertices to boost the framerate of any 3D game without modding it. Even the 60Hz video output of many game consoles would not be a limit, you could just calculate more frames to reach 144Hz or any value your computer can keep up with.
 One crucial thing that needs to be done for this is to identify which vertex in one frame belongs to which vertex in the next. I don&#x27;t know how the GPU of consoles usually work with triangles and vertices on a technical level. Maybe the games just send the updated coordinates for each vertex, then it would be easy. If games send completely new triangle information (with color and texture information) every frame, then I guess it would be a lot harder. But I think it should still be possible by using some heuristic that looks at the size, texture and change in position and finds a mapping that results a (approximated) minimal overall change in size and position (and no texture change) of triangles. And if the changes become to big (when an object moves or grows really fast) and the mapping becomes too ambiguous, it would not do the interpolation for the affected triangles. That calculation would of course create a performance overhead but I feel like with modern GPUs it should work for old games.
 I understand that creating 60 fps hacks gives better results and is a cleaner approach, but it has to be done individually for each game and is not trivial and I don&#x27;t know if you even can go beyond 60 fps with this, so I think it would be nice to have this automatic fps increase option in emulators (or even old non-emulated games) to play everything with 144 fps. What do you think of this idea?

 Because if it&#x27;s the same, then why does it say that the first PRG RAM is of fixed size ($6000-$7FFF) while the other one&#x27;s size is being specified.

 HR: Bob here is a talented Java developer with 10 years of experience and is eager to learn Salesforce. He’s also a US citizen and with maybe 6 months of training in Salesforce, can do a far better job than someone with just 5 years of ”Salesforce only” experience. Do you want to interview Bob?
 Hiring Manager: No. Bob is not qualified…it’s so hard to find qualified candidates these days. We’ll have to sponsor H1-B visa for “qualified” candidates.
 HR: Ok, we’ll get the process started…it might take 3 months with the hiring and visa process…is that okay?
 Hiring Manager: That’s fine.
 3 months go by…
 HR: we have our candidate and his visa was approved. We had to “change” the job description to suit his exact skill set to submit to the labor department for labor certification. We made sure “no one else” could possibly be remotely qualified for this position except our visa candidate.
 Hiring Manager: Great work!
 HR: Yep, we do this a lot! We know all the tricks.
 Hiring Manager: The candidate will need 3 months to “ramp up”.
 HR: Wait…we could have hired Bob three months ago and he would be half way through getting trained in Salesforce by now.
 Hiring Manager: Forget Bob.
 …months go by… Bob eventually finds work as a Java developer. He never learns Salesforce even though he wanted to….the company is sponsoring the visa holder for a green card…they will be posting his job description on the job board at the back of the building right next to the dumpster (you can’t get to the board…there are some shipping crates blocking it), per the labor certification process (citizens are encouraged to apply)…
 …15 years go by…the visa candidate now has a green card and is ready to move on to greener pastures….he wants to get into AI….he can’t…he’s not qualified…the hiring manager at the AI company will be sponsoring H1-B visa as he can’t find “qualified” candidates.

                              <span>Basically tittle. How do I work with this dude who hangs up in middle of call if he feels like it. 
 He’s filled his whole team with his friends and relatives from his country (state). They are all part of his Yes-Man team. 
 If I try approaching him, he simply ignores my message. 
 They speak their own language even in Daily Scrum and refinement.

 Highlighted the portion I thought was particularly salty seems mean to do that to current employees and doesn&#x27;t seem particularly constructive at this point and forum.

                              <span>Around every year I put in applications to multiple companies to see what stack is popular these days and, if the salary is good enough, switch over to them.
 I noticed these past year that unless the company is not specifically looking for the &quot;Devops&quot; in name, they will outright not contact you. I applied to multiple positions and almost got every call that was looking for &quot;Devops Engineers&quot;, but would get a few answers back if the role was &quot;SRE&quot;, &quot;Platform Engineer&quot;, or &quot;Software Engineer&quot;; even though the requirements would be identical and my experience 100% matched! I remember I applied to a SRE position where I had every requirement they wanted and they never called me back.
 I wonder if hiring managers are breezing through the resumes and if they see the title of your current job is off they just pass you?
 I am wondering if it would be unethical if you just switch your job title to what they want and explain during the first call you get back that you are technically a &quot;devops engineer&quot; but your experience matches their requirements?

                              <span>So I have worked for many companies both from small to FAANG, and I have always seen that the rate limiting is just a fixed number of requests per IP/user/etc... Is there any open-source limiter that limits, for example, when the response time of a specific endpoint increases beyond some threshold? Or maybe we can hook it up to the metrics of the resource causing the bottleneck (ex: user-info-db-cpu) and decide when to start dropping requests?
 And one additional feature might be: automatically enqueue the requests or convert them to Kafka messages for example? I can consider writing such a service if there is no such thing in the market.

                              <span>Microsoft was encouraging our company with incentives to move from ado to github. You can can just import repository from ado to github, but you can&#x27;t migrate work items. 
 Because of this, I created pwsh migration script. In this script you perserve issue hierarchy, by your choice with either github beta tasklist or task list. It adds labes based on ado tag and work item type (feature,user story...). 
 It maps users based on github username and ado email which you have to provide as a json format. It save issue state, open or closed. Copies comments to github with metadata.
 Since github issues have 50 000 char limit in issues description, html to md is implemented since work item descriptions in ado are saved as html. This can balloon pretty fast if you have tabels in ado.
 Created github action for this script. Is this something that is needed? Should I publish this on on github marketplace?

 Next 6 months: inventory system and ui. 
 Now I wil preface this by saying I only work on it here and there, not full time and I have gone through a few different inventory systems just to try them out, but God damn ui and inventory is so much work. If you don&#x27;t at least sort of like data structures and algorithms, don&#x27;t ever make an rpg with an inventory system. 
 Just throwing that out there lol, what have your hang ups been while working on your own game?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently at Amazon. It&#x27;s... fine... but I&#x27;m not enjoying my work. I have WLB balance and I make great money. I do believe making games is a dream for me, but I worry that I&#x27;m suffering from grass-is-greener-syndrome.
 In a few years, I should have the opportunity to change jobs and even accept a lower salary (if needed) and still meet my retirement goals.
 That being said, I&#x27;d love to hear from other engineers who have made the same switch.
  
How did you make the transition?
 Did you have any gamedev experience at the time you switched careers?
 Any particular skills you had to pick up before becoming a gamedev? After being a gamedev?
 Would you do it again?
 Did you get a job at an established gamedev company first, or did you go off on your own and start your own thing?
 How much of a hit to your total compensation did you take (if at all)?
 Any advice you could give me or someone in similar shoes?

                              <span>Okay, I understand money reasons, but hear me out. 
 I see lots of games that are clearly made to be played with friends. But they are also not free games, so if you have a group of, say, 2-3 people you might want to play with, that means you have to get 3 copies... Which now makes the total cost a AAA game. 
 And, depending on who you play with, it might just be a fun few hours and never play it again. 
 But we used to have couch play, so you wouldn&#x27;t need to buy multiple copies of games, just get one and get your friends to your hause and call it a day. 
 So, wouldn&#x27;t a game that you could buy and get a few codes to give to your friends, but they can only play the game as long as you are playing the game increase sells? 
 I&#x27;m talking from a place of ignorance and just from a place of &quot;wow, that game looks fun, but I can&#x27;t sink 60 bucks to play it for a few hours&quot;. It just seems that could fix that issue and the solution seems to be relatively simple. Get the game on steam, give friends code, friends can now only play if you are in a party with them.

                              <span>Today I got a tip from a helpful community member that someone on Discord asked him to playtest &quot;his&quot; game. The request came with a link to a Blogspot with only one post, containing a description, screenshots, and download link to the demo.
 The problem? The game in question is mine, and whoever did this is definitely did not have my permission to share it. The entire text of the blog post is 100% copy/pasted from my own website. The copypasted description does include a link to one of my own pages (yeah, how lazy is that?), but otherwise it doesn&#x27;t credit me as the author or link to me at all.
 Judging from the download size, it looks like this only contains my free, years-old demo with only the first few levels - not the paid package with the whole game.
 So, my questions are:
  
How worried should I be about this? Could this be a threat to my sales or my brand?
 
What actions can I take against this plagiarist?
 
What exactly does the plagiarist stand to game by offering a free game demo and asking random people to &quot;test&quot; something they clearly aren&#x27;t going to be able to finish?
 
Has this sort of thing happened to anyone else?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been tasked with creating a payment application at my company that acts as an &quot;Adyen wrapper&quot; (and can work with other payment gateways as well). The goal is to develop an abstract API that centralizes payment requests and forwards them to the appropriate payment gateway for processing. Essentially, this is similar to what Adyen does with various payment processors.
 One of our senior developers suggested using a microservices architecture for this project. In this setup, one microservice would receive the payment requests, and there would be separate microservices for each payment method we use. These microservices would then communicate with the respective payment gateways.
 I believe that Adyen and other payment gateways might use a similar approach in their systems.
 Here are my questions:
  
How do payment gateways handle communication between their internal services?
 Is the communication entirely synchronous, with microservices calling each other using HTTP?
 Do they use message queues? If so, how do they ensure the process appears synchronous to the client? For example, when I make a payment request to Adyen, they return the status in the same response.
  
Thanks for your help!

                              <span>I currently work at a small startup that is quite financially stable and growing dynamically. This is my first time working at such a small company, and generally at a startup. I joined the company when they were nearing the end of the MVP phase. I&#x27;ve been here for about six months, and everything has gone very well so far. We have successfully met the milestones, increased revenues, and brought the product to a level where the first users can start using it. However, I have some questions and doubts about this.
 I&#x27;m afraid that I won&#x27;t have any work, that there won&#x27;t be anything to do. I asked the management about this, and they told me not to worry, that the main work is just beginning. Users will start using the product, and we&#x27;ll start collecting feedback and experiences. From these, there will be a lot of bug fixes, hotfixes, and feature tickets, and eventually, the whole backend will need to be rewritten, etc. I got scared because we progressed so well that we almost ran out of tickets.
 They also said they want to put every financial resources into development and also hiring a new developer this Fall.
 I recently got a raise, and everyone is satisfied with me, but given the current market situation, I am quite paranoid. What would you advise? I&#x27;m overthinking it probably.

                              <span>The company I am at has executives talking publicly about investing hundreds of millions of dollars into AI initiatives to replace employees. Since that seems to be almost every company right now, I have to imagine some other people are in a similar situation. There also doesn&#x27;t seem to be a strong vision of how they&#x27;re going to use AI to do this, just a strong vision that this is what they&#x27;re going to do.
 I&#x27;m not in a position to direct the project, just more of a grunt attempting to put together what&#x27;s assigned to me. That said, most of the conjectures I&#x27;ve heard around the company are to build automations that the company has always said we wanted, but never prioritized. These are not things that are impossible or even particularly difficult, they were just not the core business focus …</span>

                              <span>This might be just letting of steam but I&#x27;d like to hear how people deal with team members that simply refuse to change. The context is that because of various problems and frustrations in the past, we decided (as a team, where I&#x27;m the techical lead) to introduce a new git branching strategy using rebasing. Some team members weren&#x27;t familiar with this so we had some workshops and I wrote up some detailed documentation and everything seemed good.
 But one developer in particular is basically refusing to change and just does what he used to, so it becomes a hassle for him to clean up his branch when he creates a merge request, and this has to be done for him because he claims that rebasing doesn&#x27;t work for him and he can&#x27;t force push, etc. This is in addition to him continuing to complain that the new way is wrong.
 It doesn&#x27;t help that our project manager is seeing this and is starting to suggest we rethink the strategy if there are so many problems, etc.
 I don&#x27;t want to get into the pros and cons of the branching strategy, because I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the underlying problem, but how do you guys deal with stubborn developers like this? Otherwise working with him is great, but this issue is really starting to frustrate everyone.
 Any tips or advice would be more than welcome.

                              <span>I work as a platform engineer and I&#x27;ve recently built a service to serve reactjs apps from an S3 bucket.
 It has an API service that builds the react app and uploads the build folder to the S3 bucket.
 A reverse proxy server listening on *.faas.dev.aws where * is the deployment name. Users can deploy their react apps using the api service with a unique name and they can access them with a url like my-react-app.faas.dev.aws
 Apart from this, I&#x27;ve also built a k8s operator that pulls secrets from our vault and stores them as native k8s secrets.
 What projects did you built or currently working on?

 The author - a Staff Tech Engineer - says in a comment: “…using Go for real production ETL”
 What are your thoughts?

 I see several posts like: I have 1 offer but it’s for (QA, BA, IT, or no name startup). Should I take it?
 Obviously, if you have no other offers, you should take it. You’re in no position to be picky. Any experience is better than no experience, even if it’s not SWE.
 You could make an argument that time would be better spent doing projects or LC, but I don’t think that’s the case. You should be doing that on top of working anyways. 
 At least with non-SWE internships, you can get content for behavioral interviews or references. Could also network to SWE positions at the company. Work on side projects that involve coding.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been working as a SWE for a couple months at a mid-tier company. It&#x27;s my first job out of college. It&#x27;s very well known but it&#x27;s not primarily a tech company. The pay is good (125k, remote, and I live with parents). I recently unexpectedly got a return offer from the rainforest that will explode on Sunday. (180k first year TC, 165k second year, plus stocks with they&#x27;re messed up vesting schedule. This would be in Seattle in-person. This is very unexpected and will kind of uproot my life. I wanted to ask if the career opportunities are good enough to warrant quitting my current job and starting this new one.

                              <span>That you have previous internship experience. Even better if it&#x27;s name brand.
 The reality is a lot of CS students don&#x27;t get internships, but they for damn sure well will be looking for a full time job. 
 There&#x27;s this idea that new grad is harder because there is more guaranteed competition, but if you have previous internship(s), you immediately have an edge over 70 percent of all new grad CS students.
 The reason why internships are hard at first is because everyone is in the same boat: little to no previous experience. So standing out from the crowd is hard if you don&#x27;t go to a name brand school. 
 Would love to hear thoughts on this take.

 Fjall is an embeddable LSM-based forbid-unsafe Rust key-value storage engine. Its goal is to be a reliable &amp; predictable but performant general purpose KV storage engine, for both smaller, but especially larger-than-RAM data sets. I have just released version 1, which stabilizes its data format for all future 1.x.x versions.
 Its design is heavily influenced by LevelDB/RocksDB’s architecture and generally yields similar performance. It has similar features, like:
  
Range and prefix searches with forwards and backwards iteration
 Data partitions (”Column Families” in RocksDB-speak)
 Cross-partition atomic write batches
 MVCC &amp; Snapshot reading
 Adjustable durability guarantees
 Size-tiered (write-optimized), Levelled (read-optimized) and FIFO compaction (for ephemeral data)
  
Compared to other Rust storage engines (e.g. Persy, ReDB, …), Fjall has better write and space amplification across the board while still having competitive read performance. It also has very low startup times (~0.1s for 1 billion keys) and very short compile times (~3s on my machine, compared to ~90s for RocksDB).
 AMA here, on GitHub (star the repo ❤️, https://github.com/fjall-rs/fjall/discussions) or on Discord (https://discord.com/invite/HvYGp4NFFk)
 You can find and run Fjall and other Rust storage engines in my Rust storage engine benchmark: https://github.com/marvin-j97/rust-storage-bench
 I have also made a bunch (more coming soon) of examples demonstrating some practical usage: https://github.com/fjall-rs/fjall/tree/main/examples

                              <span>On the road to adoption for production rust I have encountered a minor roadbump.
 In large C/C++ code bases it is the norm to prefix certain variables with certain prefixes such as function parameters with p_ and local variable with l_.
 How do you do that in Rust.
 The best answer I could come up with right now is a clippy extension (aka. fork clippy/ open a pull request)
 I imagine since my superficial Google Foo couldn&#x27;t find anything the answer might also be interesting for others.
 EDIT: To those attacking my senior for putting such requirements on the code, GET OVER IT. It may not be the most idiomatic or modern thing to do however if it helps someone who has navigated such code bases for 40 years read my code better for his review that’s a tradeoff I’m willing to make. In exchange he’s willing to put up with a completely new language to him. I’m grateful for being given the chance instead of being dismissed entirely. He comes from a pure automotive background written in C for critical systems. That’s a wide jump compared to Rust. If I can learn what he learned over these years and how he applies it to Rust this is probably way more invaluable than any philosophical battleground.
 PS: Hungarian notation for function parameters isn’t nearly as bad as you make it out to be. Give it a sincere shot and you will see.

                              <span>I’m new to rust from c++, working on a connect 4 project. I was surprised at how crazy the improvement on a release build was. The bot went from processing ~1 M nodes/s to ~5.5 M nodes/s.
 How on earth?? I made sure to explicitly do references and stuff to reduce unnecessary copies, so what else could it be doing for such a drastic improvement?

                              <span>HVM2 is finally production ready, and now it runs on GPUs. Bend is a high-level language that looks like Python and compiles to it. All these projects were written in Rust, obviously so! Other than small parts in C/CUDA. Hope you like it!
  
HVM2 - a massively parallel runtime.
 
Bend - a massively parallel language.

                              <span>I have gotten an Amazon offer after 3 months of unemplpyment however I have during the last month been drinking 12 beers a day and start shaking if I dont drink.
 Is it worth joining Amazon and giving up 12 beers a day?
 How is the drinking culture at amazon?

                              <span>I am grateful to have had at least a couple of internships before i graduated but it seems like they mean nothing.
 Lately i&#x27;ve been getting rejected right after applying by a lot of small non-tech companies like local hospital networks, retail companies, healthcare companies, etc
 I&#x27;m applying to junior/associate/level 1 SWE roles so its not like i&#x27;m competing with people with 10 YEO. are ex-faang, ex-jane street people really applying to these kinds of places? because who else could those &quot;other candidates&quot; be?

                              <span>I have a function void fn(int *arr, int size_arr) ; which only touches arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[size_arr] (say, the function adds 1 to these entries).
 However, I have an array b of size n, and I would like to modify every value in b, i.e. b[0], b[1], ..., b[n-1].
 Is it safe to do fn(b - 1, n) ;? The reason I am worried is because b - 1 is a completely wild address. b could be the address 1 and b - 1 could be NULL for all I know.
 The function does dereference arr[0]. But still is this safe?

                              <span>so I am a beginner c programmer and I want to eventually be able to contribute to gnome. ideally to one of their compilers but that seems very far away so for now something small and simple seems like a good idea.
 I am not sure how to go about acquiring the relevent skills or which parts of the project need more attention

                              <span>I have a server. It need some memory pool that will have spike usage:
 Suppose I allocate 16 GB using mmap. This memory will be not mapped to physical memory until I use it. So let say I begin to use it. Memory pages will be mapped to physical memory, but if I use say 100 mb, only 100 mb will be mapped. 
 Most of the time, 100-200 kb will be used.
 From time to time, the server will need more spike memory, say 11 GB.
 After finishing the workload, I do not need any of this memory.
 Then is a good idea, this memory to be returned to the OS.
 I know this can be done with munmap(). However this suppose to be slow.
 Question is can I do this using madvice(), but in such way, so I will be able to privide the memory again for the next spike?
 Second part of the question, I did some test program, but found is difficult to debug, since both top and pmap give me full amount of virtual memory and not show ammount of mapped pages to physical memory (or maybe I am testing it incorrectly)
 Thanks

                              <span>Yet somehow I can find the answer. From K&amp;R:
 #include  int main() { int c; while ((c &#x3D; getchar()) !&#x3D; EOF) putchar(c); printf(&quot;Breakfast!&quot;); } 
 I&#x27;m running this inside vscode in the terminal. If I type in B, then it prints back a B. Great. Now why the heck does &quot;Breakfast&quot; not print after it prints the B? It&#x27;s almost like I have return after putchar.

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Path* bfs(Graph* g, int start, int end, int numRows) { int visited[100]; // TODO implement isVisited field in Vertex for (int i &#x3D; 0; i adj_list; while(temp !&#x3D; NULL) { int neighbor &#x3D; temp-&gt;num; if(!visited[neighbor]) { p &#x3D; addToPath(p, neighbor, cost + 1); visited[neighbor] &#x3D; 1; queue[rear++] &#x3D; neighbor; } if (neighbor &#x3D;&#x3D; end) { return p; } temp &#x3D; temp-&gt;next; } } return p; } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;m planning on writing a filemodd as my second project in C, so experience is still lacking. I&#x27;ve been reading a lot about file system events [ linux ] and came across Inotify for monitoring file system events. However, I would like to watch and keep track of which process accesses a file being watched. Is this possible without reading the proc fs? I&#x27;ve came across (process control block) PSB, is it possible to read the PCB of a system in user mode without root access?
 NB: Thank you, and I&#x27;ll be more than grateful if you can point me to right resources!!!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been a web developer for the last 5-6 years(mainly frontend, but I worked with Node.js and express for a while). I work for a Big Tech company and I earn a reasonable salary. 
 My problem is I&#x27;m exhausted and I feel I can&#x27;t keep it anymore: We have a lot of strict deadlines and everyone works an unreasonable amount of hours.
 Last Friday, I had to work until 4AM to finish an urgent task that just appeared. This week, I worked 10-12 hours days to finish a bunch of important tasks. I&#x27;m not the only one - almost all of my team worked until midnight on tasks and codereviewsw.
 I don&#x27;t know how to handle this because this is the way we worked for the last 3 years. My manager has very good intentions and he is a technical person, but I feel this is part of the problem.
 Our estimates goes like that: We need to build a popup with some tex and 2 buttons and call an API when &quot;confirm is clicked&quot;.
 Me: It will take 3-4 days. Let&#x27;s say 4 to be safe.
 Manager: 4 days for this ? It&#x27;s simple enough, should be 2 days at most.
 Me: Yeah, but we want 100% coverage unit tests, use feature flags, the API is not ready yet and we use mock data, 2 people should review the code, we deploy on stage and prod, manual test everything (no QA). We even write e2e tests. 
 In reality, even 4 days is not enough because some things are always unclear, and I have to clarify with 2-3 people and propose solutions. The codebase is very big and a lot of code has been untoched for years etc. So I end up working 12 hours/day to respect even the 4 days estimation, knowing my manager thinks is should be 2, which in fact should probably be 6-8 days because I&#x27;m not a robot.
 And I can&#x27;t continue to work like that. I don&#x27;t have time for myself, let alone personal development and learning new things.
 I don&#x27;t know what to do. I talked with my manager a lot, and it&#x27;s true we managed to complete the task in 4 days, but with me working 12+ hours and going above&amp;beyound for this to happen.

                              <span>I think they’re both pretty good schools, my primary concerns are name recognition and price. Does name recognition matter that much in CS-related industry? The top 30 one has greater national name recognition and cheaper, but the top 100 is smaller, in my hometown, and I think is more student-oriented? Let me know what you guys think.
 Edit: Also, they’re not just any random schools I chose. Both are heavily tech-oriented, just to add context. One is well-known nationally, the other is well-known regionally and maybe semi-nationally.

                              <span>Have you guys ever been in a situation where there’s tons of work that needs to be done and it seems like every week more work is added to the pile, but your team just doesn’t have enough developers to keep up with the work load and management won’t hire more devs? And to make matters worse it seems like lately each new task is in a repo you haven’t worked in before and the changes being requested are not small changes.
 I assume you all just do what you can but if something doesn’t get done then don’t worry about it? Just curious to hear if any others are in this situation.

The CFO mentioned he wants the engineer who makes a mistake to say “hey here’s what I did wrong, here’s how we can avoid this, etc etc” and wants it to be a learning opportunity. But then he started mentioning that the execs have no insight on who the top performing engineers are and who the weakest players are, and that talking about the failures may give them insight on who keeps making mistakes and why they are making mistakes. I told them a description of our failures, like a post mortem (thanks for that tidbit, redditors) should be blameless and be about lessons learned, and not serve the purpose of who’s not pulling …</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 Currently I am working on creating my own custom hashmap implementation. I am also comparing the performance of my implementation against the performance of the ktprime &quot;emhash8&quot; hashmap. Currently, when I test both hashmaps with google&#x27;s benchmarks library, it shows that my hashmap design is extremely slow, nearly 3 times slower than emhash8 and significantly slower than std::unordered_map , however, when I test all 3 hashmaps CLion&#x27;s integrated profiler, it shows that my hashmap is faster than the other 2 hashmaps. I initially assumed this was because I ran my hashmap first when I tested with CLions profiler, but the changing the order of the benchmarks doesn&#x27;t appear to effect the performance. I am not sure which performance metric I should follow here.

                              <span>In the c++ modules documentation syntax definition:
 export(optional) module module-name module-partition ﻿(optional) attr ﻿(optional) ; export declaration export { declaration-seq ﻿(optional) } export(optional) import module-name attr ﻿(optional) ; export(optional) import module-partition attr ﻿(optional) ; export(optional) import header-name attr ﻿(optional) ; module; module : private; 
 there is an optional attr in the end of some productions, but the documentation doesn&#x27;t clarify what those are. I don&#x27;t believe : private is an attribute because the doc doesn&#x27;t say so and it has its own production.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I come from a background in C# (approximately 15 years) and have always had a passion for C++. I am particularly enthusiastic about roguelike games. In the past month, I&#x27;ve been dedicating my time to studying C++ and, as a challenge to myself (something I&#x27;ve already done in C#), 
 I&#x27;ve embarked on creating a roguelike engine. 
 I&#x27;ve created the project on GitHub and would like to ask if anyone could perform a code review to see if the conventions I&#x27;ve used are correct. Could someone lend me a hand? The repository is located at https://github.com/tgiachi/hyperion-engine. Thank you all for your help!
 Tom

 I created fronend in react ( javascript )
 I have written web server ie. account validation, user credentials validation, api etc. in python.
 I have to process a MP4 file to be loaded easily and convert to other format or any other processing after one uploads a video which require too much CPU power and complex algo. So I chooses C++ for it.
 How do C++ and Python works in backend.
 What if there is any other language like Rust for Hardwork and Java for Server related work.
 How to these integrate ...? 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅

                              <span>Hi everyone! Does anybody understand how &quot;is_transparent&quot; works on a level of STL sources? If so, please be so kind and provide an explanation. Specifically, I do not understand how trivial SFINAE defined in stl_function.h for &quot;is_transparent&quot; (homework is done) works for hash table making it able to search for a std::string_view while having keys of std::string.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am updating a very old C codebase to a modern C++ approach. But this process is not straightforward. This means I cannot transform the C code right away into modern C++ with unit tests and all the code quality tools I would like.
 As long as I&#x27;m grooming it up, I tend to make mistakes. Namely I refactor the code before I functionally replace the old code with a modern C++ approach. For instance, I replace statements like

 into

 but I run into problems with boolean variables, as I mistakenly remove negative logic ! without noticing. We have pull requests and these mistakes are also not detected, so double human problem here.
 That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking this: before I can go full unit testing, does anybody know if there&#x27;s any tool that can detect from git commit to git commit the change of boolean logic that it&#x27;s &quot;easy&quot; to miss if you&#x27;re a human but not if you&#x27;re a computer?

 Obvious things that came to my mind:
 - Add compiler flags -Werror, -Wall etc.
 - Make use of sanitizers in tests
 - clang-format
 - clang-tidy checker in CI/CD

                              <span>Clang, GCC and MSVC appear to disagree on how to handle potential &quot;shadowing&quot; of parameter pack names by dependent types:
 https://godbolt.org/z/PTne4M3oq
 Now, this is the sort of issue that can be easily avoided by using names that do not clash (or writing some wrapper that exposes the dependent type with another name), but I cannot, for the life of me, figure out which compiler, if any, is right according to the standard (so that the bug can be properly reported).
 I would say Clang handles everything according to my intuitive expectations, but I recognize the possibility that it is simply being overly generous with what it accepts. EDIT: EDG also has this behaviour.
 (I realize there is some overlap with /r/cpp_questions since this is technically a question about C++, but, as it has mostly to do with what appears to be an edge case in the standard and its handling by different compilers, I felt it was more appropriate to ask here.)

                              <span>I m noob, so sorry in advance if I misunderstood any concept here. As far as I have understood is that, we use &quot;return 0&quot; at the end of the function to define the successful execution of the code. But there are cases I think where we use something else than just &quot;0&quot;, please give a super easy/basic example of a int function where we are using something else than &quot;0&quot; and how it effects?

 Disabling realtime protection, adding the project directory to my antivirus exclusion paths, and setting the priority of my terminal instance to realtime has had no effect on the build time
 I&#x27;m running Windows 10 home 64-bit build 19045 and the latest version of Msvc. This is all stored on an SSD. Ram is.32gb of ddr4. I&#x27;m compiling in debug mode (/Od /DEBUG:FULL)
 Honestly at a loss here. Does anyone know of a fix?
 Edit: I&#x27;m using the commandline version of cmake, so there&#x27;s no IDE involved

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to programming, and projects/tools provided with CMake files are stumping me.
 I&#x27;ve figured out some Lua, python, and Arduino (AFAIU basically modified C++ with a special IDE). With those the process of using source code is relatively simple even with limited understanding, either:
  
Set up dev environment, troubleshoot environmental variables and dependencies, then run some compile command in terminal (my Lua experience);
 Choose directory and copy-paste a command to terminal (my python experience); or
 Open the source with an IDE and use built-in tools to upload to device (my Arduino experience).
  
With CMake, even the official &quot;Basic Starting Point&quot; is a multi-step process filled with concepts I don&#x27;t understand, which doesn&#x27;t end in me being able to build someone else&#x27;s CMake project. Almost everything I read (example) says &quot;I know you&#x27;re on Windows/OSX, but this is how it works in linux...&quot; and is targeting people developing their own projects.
 A lot of the projects I find provided as CMake directories aren&#x27;t significantly more complex than projects I successfully use in other formats. I&#x27;m talking platform-specific emulators, image conversion tools, etc. Is there any way for a beginner like me to use these, or do I just need to skip them until I&#x27;ve learned a lot more?

 Any suggestions? https://godbolt.org/z/hjh3a8Tqo
 template  struct ValueT {}; struct Container1 { using Value &#x3D; ValueT; }; struct Container2 { using Value &#x3D; ValueT; }; template  struct Container3 { using Base &#x3D; T; struct Value : ValueT { typename Base::Value asBase() { return {}; } }; }; void handle(const Container1::Value &amp;v) {} void handle(const Container2::Value &amp;v) {} template void handle(const typename Container3::Value &amp;v) { return handle(v.asBase()); } int main() { Container1::Value v1; Container2::Value v2; Container3::Value v31; Container3::Value v32; handle(v1); handle(v2); handle(v31); handle(v32); return 0; }

                              <span>I&#x27;ve made plenty of emulators. NES, Apple 2, IBM PC, various others. I never really had that much of a problem getting the graphics to look correct, I even eventually figured out EGA/VGA which was a nightmare. I just can&#x27;t seem to figure out the correct way to draw Pac-Man though! (Testing with Midway arcade ROMs)
 I&#x27;m getting the tile data. If I use the two bits per pixel I get from character ROM and just treat that as a grayscale image, I get a totally recognizable display! I see the words on the title screen, I see the maze. That part&#x27;s working.
  charval &#x3D; ROM_gfx[val * 16 + idx]; pixel[0] &#x3D; (charval &amp; 0x01) | ((charval &amp; 0x10) &gt;&gt; 3); pixel[1] &#x3D; ((charval &amp; 0x02) &gt;&gt; 2) | ((charval &amp; 0x20) &gt;&gt; 4); pixel[2] &#x3D; ((charval &amp; 0x04) &gt;&gt; 3) | ((charval &amp; 0x40) &gt;&gt; 5); pixel[3] &#x3D; ((charval &amp; 0x08) &gt;&gt; 4) | ((charval &amp; 0x80) &gt;&gt; 6); 
 Where val is a byte out of the char RAM and ROM_gfx[] is the character ROM array. No problem!
 But what&#x27;s the correct way to get the full color? There&#x27;s color RAM just above char RAM. I believe I&#x27;m supposed to use the same offset in there for the tile as I do for the char RAM. Then left shift it by 2 and OR the values from the pixel array above?
 Then there&#x27;s a color ROM and a palette ROM. I thought I was supposed to index palette ROM from the result I got from the above, and then I use that value to index the color ROM which gives me the RGB values?
 That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying, and it just looks like a mess. Completely wrong.
 What am I missing? I thought this one would be simple lol. I can&#x27;t seem to find a clear explanation anywhere.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m working on adding audio support into my GB emulator, using SDL as the backend. So far it&#x27;s working with the following audio spec:
 SDL_AudioSpec specification &#x3D; { .freq &#x3D; DMGL_AUDIO_SAMPLES * 60, .format &#x3D; AUDIO_F32, .channels &#x3D; 1, .samples &#x3D; DMGL_AUDIO_SAMPLES, };
 However, the audio gets out of sync with the video frames over time and I&#x27;m not sure why. If I change the channel count to 2, it stays in-sync, but with gaps in the audio stream because I&#x27;m generating mono audio samples. Changing the channel count to 2 an then generating seperate left/right samples reintroduces the sync issue.
 Has anyone seen this before?

                              <span>The title. I swapped my OS to Ubuntu, Pop!OS recently. Like a month ago. Since then, my file transfer stuff between hard disks have been incredibly faster than it was in Windows. It may be placebo, I don&#x27;t know. If it&#x27;s faster, then why?

                              <span>The current buzz is that Dell and others are coming up with bunch of ARM-powered laptops on the market soon. Yes, I am aware that there already are some on the market, but they might or might not be the next big thing. I wanted informed opinions to what extent this is a threat to the current non-professional use of Linux. As things currently stand, you can pretty much install Linux easily on anything you buy from e.g., BestBuy, and, even more importantly, you can install it on a device that you purchased before you even had any inkling that Linux would be something you&#x27;d use.
 Feel free to correct me, but here is as I understand the situation as a non-tech professional. Everything here with a caveat &quot;in the foreseeable future&quot;.
  
Intel/AMD are not going to disappear, and it is uncertain to what extent ARM laptops will take over. There will be Linux certified devices for professionals regardless and, obviously, Linux compatible-hardware for, say, for server use.
 Linux has been running on ARM devices for a long time, so ARM itself is not the issue. My understanding is that that boot systems for ARM devices are less standardized and many current ARM devices need tailored solutions for this. And then there is the whole Apple M-series devices issue, with lots of non-standard hardware.
  
Since reddit/the internet is full of &quot;chicken little&quot; reactions to poorly understood/speculative tech news, I wanted to ask to what extent you think that the potential new wave of ARM Windows laptops is going to be:
 a) not a big deal, we will have Linux running on them easily in a newbie-friendly way very soon, or
 b) like the Apple M-series, where progress will be made, but you can hardly recommend Linux on those for newbies?
 Any thoughts?

 I just stumbled upon this: https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/17wu2gz/google_confirms_they_will_disable_ublock_origin/
 And was wondering whats up with this package: 
 https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/webext-ublock-origin-chromium
 Im a bit confused because I didnt even think about installing extensions for a browser from outside. Chromium is only my second browser, using firefox mainly but still interested how u think about this?
 Which way do u prefer to install that extension? I also dont see that uBlock Origin is removed from the chrome web store as it is 2024 now?
 Im happy about any clarification if somebody knows more about this..

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been weighing my options lately and could really use some advice. I&#x27;m stuck between pursuing a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Cybersecurity or Computer Science. Money is a big concern for me, especially since my dad is retiring soon leaving me in-charge of being the breadwinner of the family, taking care of both my parents and my sibling who will at one point sooner or later also be going to university...
 Here&#x27;s the deal: I&#x27;m not exactly a math whiz, and the thought of getting tangled up in complex equations in a CS program is daunting. I&#x27;ve heard that Cybersecurity might be a bit lighter on the math, which sounds like a relief.
 But I also want to make sure I&#x27;m setting myself up for a solid career path with good job prospects and financial stability on a global scale. So, which field do you think offers a more secure role and better opportunities in the long run?
 Any insights or experiences you can share would be super helpful. Thanks in advance for your input!

 First off, I want to thank this community for the incredible response and feedback I received when I first shared about PicoUSB. Your insights and suggestions have been invaluable in shaping the development of this project.
 Since then, I&#x27;ve been hard at work refining PicoUSB to make it even easier to produce and ship. I&#x27;m incredibly excited about the progress We&#x27;ve made with PicoUSB. We are now at final Version: V0.6. As always, I welcome your thoughts, feedback, and suggestions as we continue to evolve and improve PicoUSB.

                              <span>Hi Everyone.
 Background:
 I am new to penetration testing/hacking etc. I&#x27;ve been interested in the field of computers for long, and know basic Python, Java, etc. A short while ago my spare PC&#x27;s windows did not boot up properly, so I messed around with it and remembered how much I enjoy understanding systems etc. which lead to rediscovering my interest in hacking, cybersecurity, etc.
 Anyway, I am looking for good learning materials, but I am not sure whether books are worth while or if it is better to learn directly from the internet. I usually prefer books, but I also know the world of computing advances fast. 
 My question:
 Are there good books/youtube etc. accounts/websites you would suggest to a beginner?
 Thanks for taking the time to read and respond, I appreciate it.

                              <span>I&#x27;m finding I like arch too much. My personality types is an obsessive cleaner and organizer. I am very creative and there are so many things I can do with Arch that I can&#x27;t seem to get with other distros. 
 But I get so frustrated when I want something, can&#x27;t say what I want to look it up. I like different aspects of many distros and sadly trying to combine them is not working for me. 
 How many people feel like there is too much you want to do that you have no idea how or where to start let alone put it into words. Arch is the only one that has all the pretty bells and whistles of almost every kind.

 I followed two courses in PluralSight by Robert Horvick which was mostly data structures. I didn&#x27;t have issues with that but I wanted more to do with algorithms. So I signed up for Coursera&#x27;s Princeton Algorithms course. It&#x27;s not going well. I&#x27;ve been taking notes and I can follow as the teacher is talking and going through slides and examples but we get to the quizzes and projects and I don&#x27;t have a clue.....

 I have tried finding projects but it is difficult!
 I looked into building a website but I will need to learn JS and more.

                              <span>Hello, everyone! I recently returned from the war, in which I participated for more than 2 years (I am an officer of the Armed Forces of Ukraine), and it so happened that I decided to change my profession. I have always been interested in IT and technology, how everything works &quot;under the hood&quot;. Now I&#x27;m studying the Python programming language, everything seems to be okay, I understand how it works, what is involved and the specifics, but when it comes to performing some independent task, I just get stuck. It doesn&#x27;t seem like a very difficult task, but I can sit for days and think about how to do it, and eventually I start doing a lot of googling and using artificial intelligence to solve it, and everything works out. But there is no such thing as me realizing how to do it better on my own. Although other people in my study group do it much faster than me, so I sometimes lose motivation, but I keep doing it. And I feel stupid all the time. Maybe I&#x27;m not studying very effectively, what would you advise me to do in such a situation? Thank you all for your response.

                              <span>Dependencies for languages, specifically python
 I was downloading Python today and was wondering the general rules for what is needed to actually make a language work. So I see this
 So is &quot;Python 3&quot; a complier or something? What actually is &quot;Python 3&quot; from their website? Is it a compiler? If its just &quot;the language,&quot; what actually is that? Obviously, VS Code is just the IDE. But then what is VS Code Python extension? Is that just preparing the IDE for using Python? What would happen if you just get the VS Code Extension and not actually Python 3? 
 TLDR; What are the needed tools for setting up and using a coding language? Difference between the actual download from their website(Python, Oracle, Jetbrains) and the extension in the IDE?

                              <span>Hey all...want to hear some outside advice from people in a bunch of tech subs. 
 I&#x27;m in a predicament here. I am currently a junior sysadmin. I just got offered a 60% increase from my current salary at another company. 
 My thing is, I will most likely be learning less stuff at the new job, with not as many tools to play it, and will probably stunt my learning growth with on the job stuff. I would need to work very hard off the clock to keep up with skills and learning new ones, especially if I want to go higher than sysadmin (which I want to do asap).
 Current job, I get underpaid. Im salary and still put in 12 hour days pretty much all the time. I knew that once I took the promotion to junior sysadmin. But saying that, this is a much bigger company that i currently work for, with more access to new tools, more projects, stuff of that nature, so im nervous that I wont be learning as much at the new place than now. 
 I would like to move up to Cloud engineer, and eventually hopefully a devops role if im lucky and work hard enough.
 What do you guys think? Stay? Or go? Obviously the $$$ will help me out TREMENDOUSLY, but I am super worried about plateauing at the new job quickly.
 Whoever reads this, thank you very much for taking ur time to read it!

                              <span>The current tech job market certainly doesn&#x27;t make it an easier, but I do hold a CCNP, certification for AWS-SAA as well as Linux. I have plenty of automation experience. At home and in my spare time, I&#x27;m building a GitLab portfolio using mostly Terraform, Docker, sometimes Ruby and Python. I have my Ansible scripts in there as well. I&#x27;m really working at trying to make the switch from networks to cloud or DevOps because that is my goal as I enjoy the work, I enjoy working with code much more than my current role and like working with teams and the bigger picture. Haven&#x27;t gotten a single nibble since I started applying back in January. Should I be sharing my GitLab on my LinkedIn, is there something I should be pushing out there since I don&#x27;t really have the on-job experience? Open to suggestions.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently restructuring my Terraform configuration within a mono-repo to streamline our CI/CD process across multiple environments (test, staging, prod). The goal is to efficiently manage infrastructure provisioning and updates for three distinct applications with (almost) distinct infrastructure residing in separate resource groups in Azure.
 Currently our Terraform configuration resided in one main.tf file.. which is realllly big and annoying to manage.
 I want to split it into environments and modules so i can spin up test infrastructure upon opening a PR for the specific app that has been changed.
 Is it a bad practice to for example structure my terraform dir like this:
 ├───modules │ ├───app1 │ ├───app2 │ ├───app3 └───environments ├───prod ├───staging └───test 
 Because if i read Hashicorp documentation correctly, i feel like they recommended this approach:
 ├───modules │ ├───App1 │ │ ├───postgres.tf │ │ ├───keyvault.tf │ │ ├───servicebus.tf │ │ └───fucnctionapp.tf │ │ └───... │ ├───App2 │ └───App3 └───environments ├───prod ├───staging └───test 
 But i feel like the problem i will be facing if i do this, is that i either end up with a environment directory for each individual app, so prod-app1, stag-app1, test-app1, prod-app2, etc.
 Or i will have to provision all of the apps, for a change to 1 app.
 But i agree with Hashicorp, that in most situations the second approach seems much more scalable and better to manage as your infrastructure grows.

                              <span>In 95% of cases, needing a process manager, or an init, in a Docker container is an anti-pattern. One container, one application, this is the way.
 However, for the remaining 5%, sometimes, an application can be multiple processes. When that is the case, it can become challenging to manage those processes within a Docker image.
 Usually, I would use a tool like supervisord. But as I was forwarding the container&#x27;s output (stdout/stderr) to syslog, there was no way to easily filter the logs of each process.
 This is why I took some time to implement procfusion. Just a TOML file to specify the commands to launch, and voilà!
 procfusion is a static Rust binary, ideal for your Docker images that are FROM scratch. No dependency on a shell required.
 I know other solutions exists, if you click the link to the Github repository, there is a small comparison with other tools.
 Feedback would be greatly appreciated :)

 The company wears as a point of pride how many acronyms they use, and people just seem to know what everything stands for because many of them have 20 years at this company or in this industry.
 I&#x27;ve asked for help and was given a few docs that define some of the terms (including a glossary of 600+ company acronyms that still fails to define many of the ones I encounter). How am I supposed to follow along on a Teams call where every sentence has two new acronyms to look up?
 Is this a normal experience at every big company?

                              <span>So for context: I’ve been at my company for nearly 3 years now. The company, A, is pretty big and somewhat regularly acquires other smaller companies and their software. Around a year ago our team randomly received meeting invites to “new hire onboarding” sessions for a much smaller company we had acquired, B. But the thing is the communication from leadership was basically non-existent as to what expectations are and what direction we were heading in.
 This was literally the first we ever heard of it. My manager didn’t even know this was happening at the time or what company B was. 
 During these meetings it became clear very quickly that the people leading the onboarding session actually thought we were all brand new employees who needed to be trained on their technologies at company B. …</span>

 How have your experiences been? Do you ever get requirements that can’t be done due to technological constraints, bad tooling, or inherently flawed designs you need to add to that risk consistency &amp; durability?

                              <span>The current issue I am facing is learning to &quot;scale through others&quot;. I can handle the technical stuff, I can figure out solutions and paths to complex problems and code them, or if I can&#x27;t, I know how to find the right people and the right knowledge to see my project through.
 The problem is that there are only so many things one can do, eventually, if the task is monumental, you become a bottle neck. This is where this whole &quot;scaling through others&quot; comes in.
 A good &quot;senior&quot; or &quot;lead engineer&quot; is a force multiplier greater than 1. A bad one is a bottle neck.
 So I was in the unfortunate situation where i had to lead a team who overall lacked the right kind of skillset for what the project demanded. We did deliver on time, but it was very stressful for me, and there&#x27;s still a lot of things that need to be refined yet. 
 So I guess the question is, how do help your team deliver when they lack a lot of the basics for the given domain? My team was mostly backend and infrastructure engineers, and they now need to work on something related to compilers and software analysis.
 Had it been just me, the project would have taken a month, but with a team it took 4 times longer, and there&#x27;s still too much friction in certain areas. Granted long term there are 5 engineers who can work on it vs 1, which is positive, but still, it was a struggle.
 I have the hunch that building a core / skeleton and then having people explore / solve isolated problems is the right way to go, but then people find excuses or avoid diving in the codebase.

                              <span>I am a team lead, and I have one mid-level developer on my team who struggles somewhat. If I give them a new feature, where the ticket outlines exactly what they need to do, then they can do it no issues. But if I give them a ticket that is &quot;figure out why this is broken&quot; they end up going around in circles for days and making no progress.
 Whatever this skill set is comes very easily and naturally to me, so I&#x27;m a bit confused as I assumed it was the same for every developer, but I guess not.
 Its not a knowledge or domain knowledge issue, as right now they are stuck fixing a bug on part of the system they worked heavily on six weeks ago.
 So my question is, what skill is this person missing and what&#x27;s the best way to learn it?

                              <span>Context was similar to GDPR, in that after 5 years, apart from back ups, all data relating to an event should disappear. Ie. hard deletion from persistent storage. Now this sounds simple enough: All records in a set of known tables (ie our event tables) with timestamp age &gt; 5 years should be hard deleted. Plus any associated blob storage NoSQL dbs as well (using ids from the relational database). Let&#x27;s ignore the implications of distributed systems and stay solely within a singular db.
 The tricky part was, how do you stop engineers submitting code that breaks this rule? For a more concrete example, a dev adds a new or modifies an existing sql table FOO with no foreign key to the previously concerned tables, but on event creation, FOO will now have some event related data (possibly transformed/hashed so it&#x27;s completely unrecogniseable from original event data, but must still be deleted)?
 It&#x27;s simple to say Code Review, but I&#x27;m looking for basically as robust a solution here, preferably as part of the CI pipeline (eg github actions). Here are some things I thought of, but kind of got stumped towards the end when data can&#x27;t be recognised.
  
Static Analysis to recognise new tables -&gt; code review carefully
 Static Analysis to see if the inputs, are eventually used on any tables not in an existing &#x27;vetted&#x27; list (I assume this is possible)
 Stand up a db via docker, then see what tables change when an event is created, if not on a vetted list, alert. This might be through inspection of logs, or using some Change Data Capture lib to help.
  
I really liked the last one, but maybe there&#x27;s some fundamental stuff I&#x27;m missing. Any one want to pitch in?

 It offers type-safe optionals inspired by Rust&#x27;s own Option type.
 This used to be a sub-package of my other project go-functional, but I learned folks were using go-functional just to use the optional type so I split it into its own package (for example GitHub&#x27;s CLI)

 I&#x27;m relatively new to Go and have implemented a simple RLE algorithm in it. It would be great to get some feedback on whether my code adheres to proper Go style and conventions, and what things I could maybe improve (still a bit unsure about the errors for example)
 package rle import ( &quot;errors&quot; &quot;math&quot; &quot;strings&quot; ) func Encode(s string) []byte { if len(s) &lt; 1 { return make([]byte, 0) } var result []byte var runIdx uint8 &#x3D; 0 prev :&#x3D; s[0] var cur byte i :&#x3D; 1 for i &lt; len(s) { prev &#x3D; s[i-1] cur &#x3D; s[i] if prev &#x3D;&#x3D; cur &amp;&amp; runIdx &lt; math.MaxUint8 { runIdx +&#x3D; 1 } else { result &#x3D; append(result, byte(runIdx)) result &#x3D; append(result, prev) runIdx &#x3D; 0 } i +&#x3D; 1 } result &#x3D; append(result, byte(runIdx)) result &#x3D; append(result, prev) return result } func Decode(d []byte) (string, error) { if len(d)%2 !&#x3D; 0 { // Bytes are in pairs (count and char), so the array must be even return &quot;&quot;, errors.New(&quot;invalid byte array received&quot;) } var sb strings.Builder for i :&#x3D; 0; i &lt; len(d); i +&#x3D; 2 { count :&#x3D; int(d[i]) + 1 char :&#x3D; d[i+1] for range count { sb.WriteByte(char) } } return sb.String(), nil }

                              <span>Do you feel like theres any book that has helped you be a better game designer? If its through it teaching you how to be a better story teller? Better at understanding and designing game mechanics? Player psychology?
 Even if its a book that has helped you be a better developer, like a book about shaders or color theory and etc!
 All suggestions are welcome! ❤️

                              <span>One week ago, on May 9th, I released a demo on Steam. I&#x27;m an indie dev, so there was no major marketing blast associated with it. At that time, the game had ~1200 wishlists, and a small but active fanbase on Discord.
  
 Demo Content
 The game is a hybrid action RPG and bullet hell. The demo features three characters and one main infinitely-generated area with 3 bosses. It also includes a sort of prototype infinite scaling endgame for players who have gotten through all of the existing demo content. 
 The demo focuses heavily on loot. Players find randomly generated items with up to 6 modifiers from a pool of potentially hundreds of mods, and can craft those items with really wacky crafting tools in order to gain exponential increases in power. The demo also features 9 skill trees, althoug…</span>

                              <span>And finally I got a demo on Steam.
 A little context
 About two years ago I decided to try making a game. It was decided to do a small, but not entirely microscopic project that would bring me satisfaction from its implementation.
 So, throughout these two years, as development progressed, I acquired and improved my skills in order to create something useful. I’m not sure that I expected to do everything much faster, I don’t even remember my initial plans and deadlines, but I already registered the game at 3 demo festivals and successfully canceled the registration, deciding that I could do better. And finally the demo appeared where I had long wanted to see it.
 What is the game about?
 “Defeat/beat people” was conceived as a mixture of tabletop warhammer (in terms of scale it turned out to be more of a kill team offshoot), Xcom and Battle brothers. Naturally, not the ultimate version, but what I can put together on my own, trying to isolate what I like about these games.
 In concept, this is a fairly simple turn-based tactics, without overload with numbers, with customization of units and quick battles that affect the balance of forces within the star system.
 Most of the game was made by me alone. My girlfriend helped with the music, and she has been putting up with this development with me from the very beginning. I was also helped by several people who tested the game and caught bugs when I was no longer physically able to sit at the computer.
 There is still a lot of work ahead. I hope to complete the full version of the game within a few months, but so far the actual development time has always been several times longer than planned.

                              <span>I was surprised to see that the set_low() and set_high() functions in the nrf_hal return a Result type since flipping a register bit seems like a infallible operation. When I looked at the source code, I found this:
 fn set_low(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result { unsafe { self.block().outclr.write(|w| w.bits(1u32 &lt;&lt; self.pin())); } Ok(()) } 
 This seems to me like infallible code that can only return Ok(()). 
 So why would they choose to have it return a Result type? It only seems to be an annoyance since you have to handle the return type by either unwrapping it or assigning it.

                              <span>Today I decided to do a simple research project anyone can reproduce: make a list of 100,000 elements in your favourite UI library.
 Why would I do something like this? We&#x27;re all being told that modern UI libraries are &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and I really don&#x27;t like this kind of marketing. Plus, I&#x27;m trying to find a suitable solution for developing cross platform applications, and I figured why not put them to the test?
 Why such a big number? Well, I&#x27;m on the same PC that can run games with Ultra settings with millions of particles interacting with each other, so 100k shouldn&#x27;t be that much, right...? right? (yeah, I know, GPU acceleration plays a big role here, but I still have 32GB and some 16 core at my disposal)

                              <span>I have been going through the port swigger labs on XSS the first ones were easy but as I proceed I started facing difficulties in understanding the walkthroughs and the video explanations like from &quot;z3nsh3ll&quot; as I currently do not know JavaScript or html (except the paragraph, heading and anchor tags).

                              <span>Currently in school for cyber security and I&#x27;m super intimidated by everything I&#x27;m reading. I&#x27;m my late 30s never knew anything about computers till I jumped in this class. I was mostly into hip hop and doing immoral things in the streets to make money now I&#x27;m trying to go legit. I have so many questions with no one to talk to about any of this cause I. A. Still don&#x27;t know shit, and B. Know more than almost everyone I know. Any advice or words of encouragement?

                              <span>This is growing trend, it always were but since the engine is gaining popularity a lot of beginners get introduced to Godot and gamedev through the mean of tutorials, there is nothing bad about it although a lot of people get lost and confused and don&#x27;t really understand how to overcome the issues they are faced when trying to write custom scripts.
 I am not an expert programmer, it&#x27;s not even my job but I do it passionately for 16 years now. I started following tutorials as well and at the time I was bad and wished someone had helped me sooner understand how to overcome the problem I was facing.
 I am trying to help as much as I can here but I see a lot of posts that could be easily done by just looking at the documentation and it would be easy for me to look down and just say something like &quot;but look here, your answer is written in plein sight&quot; but I know the doc is also a technical intimidating document that beginners don&#x27;t use as much.
 All of that to ask : &quot;Would you as a beginner be interested to know how to use the Godot documentation ?&quot;

 Background
 Lately, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant uptick in interviews and messages from recruiters flooding my inbox. It seems like my job search has shifted into high gear, demanding my attention daily. I also have a routine now, where I need to check my email each day and respond accordingly as well as handle phone calls from recruiters that call me now on a daily basis (with most of them resu…</span>

                              <span>TLDR: If you want to help end tech layoffs skip to the bottom of the post to &quot;What Can You Do&quot;.
 As you may know, the tech industry has been undergoing significant layoffs in the past couple of years. While you might think it&#x27;s exclusively because of interest rates, a relatively unknown factor contributing to this crisis is Section 174 of the US tax code.
 What’s Section 174?
 Before 2022, Section 174 allowed companies to fully deduct research and development (R&amp;D) expenses, including software engineer salaries, in the year they were incurred. This incentivized innovation and fueled the rapid growth of tech startups. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 changed the game, which went into effect in 2022. It mandated that domestic R&amp;D expenses be spread over 5 years, significantly incre…</span>

                              <span>This post is mostly a rant. Worked at XYZ F500 fintech company on a 300+ dev greenfield project, we acquired a smaller company that did our app but better and thus the whole project got cancelled and all positions terminated. 
 I know the market is worse than normal, but it feels like there&#x27;s not really a good fit for my exact level of experience. 
 While at my last job I was just as productive if not more productive at pumping out code than the senior devs, I don&#x27;t really feel &#x27;ready&#x27; yet in terms of architectural design and best practices to consider myself senior. All the senior roles are asking for 5-8 YOE anyway which seem to be the majority of positions, and the junior roles seem to be mostly looking for freshers. 
 Got rejected from a few senior roles because I just didn&#x27;t have the years. Understandable have a nice day. Got rejected from a junior role because the hiring manager said something along the lines of they were &quot;seeking candidates who are at an earlier stage in their career and can grow alongside our team&quot;. I understand that you don&#x27;t want to hire someone overqualified because they might leave soon but what the fuck. 
 Is there some secret word I need to type into Indeed to find the jobs which take people with 2 years of experience? Because I&#x27;m apparently too young to be considered senior and too old to be junior.

                              <span>I was put on a 60-day PIP at the start of this month for poor performance. I already had documented performance problems and was told that my Python coding skills are inadequete for this job. I am still on my second 3-month trial period because at the end of my first trial period, my manager decided to extend it by 3 months instead of firing me. However, I still ended up getting PIP&#x27;d. 
 So my question is: is a PIP considered to be &quot;the end&quot;? I should also mention that my performance goals are to have clean, optimized code (specifically looking at its performance) and not miss any deadlines (we consider the end of a 2-week sprint a &quot;hard deadline&quot;.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I graduated last May with my Bachelors in Management Information Systems with a focus on Technology and Management. Post graduation I didn’t have anything lined up, so during the summer I worked as a bag boy at a local golf course, then eventually went back to a broker I interned for to work as an office assistant part time all while I continued to job search. Sent out hundreds of applications and got interviews here and there, but no luck getting hired. It was honestly such a draining experience. I couldn’t even get hired for a position paying 45-50k a year and a lot of them were customer service based roles, very entry level. Fast forward to now, I got hired to be an ‘engineer’ but the role is more so a project management role. Absolutely no experience in the field and they are willing to train me. One thing I learned about obtaining a job is it’s all about who you know and if the timing is right. The guy whos position I am taking over got promoted and I happen to know someone within the company which definitely helped. One in-person interview and three weeks later they sent me an offer, which definitely caught me off guard. Nervous to start to say the least, but definitely excited and motivated to get my professional career underway. Wish me luck!

                              <span>I decided to make a format printer, using &quot;{}&quot; as generic placements for values. It kinda works, and doesn&#x27;t at the same time. I was having a massive headache dealing with recursively collecting all the args, parsing the string, ordering streams right, only for it to break in ways completely unexplainable, and extremely inconsistently when I got really frustrated was where it couldn&#x27;t print the last part of the string or it would crash, and something changed I don&#x27;t know but it just crashing either way.
 The really mindboggling part is that it would sometimes, and sometimes it would crash without printing, and I couldn&#x27;t figure out why.
 I posted this in a discord server but no one was able to help.

                              <span>Hello all,
 Novice to C++ here, trying to work with a situation where there are two objects of the same class on the heap. I want to have one of them as the &quot;currently selected&quot; version via its pointer so that methods can be called and variables edited through its methods. With the approach I&#x27;m trying If the currently selected object is changed, it seems like any edits made are not kept in memory.
 As an example, the below code (in my mind) should allow the user to swap between two &quot;Fruit&quot; objects which exist on the heap, prompting the user to change the color of the currently selected fruit and automatically swap to the other.
 When I call setColor(&quot;green&quot;) on apple, after swapping the currentFruit from banana back to apple again if I call getColor() on apple it returns &quot;red&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t make sense to me,
 How can you keep a “Fruit” object in memory that remembers its variables have been changed? Or does this question not make sense in this language and is this approach fundamentally wrong?
 #include  #include  using namespace std; class Fruit { string name; string color; public: Fruit (string n, string c) { setName(n); setColor(c); }; void setName(string s) {name &#x3D; s; return;}; string getName() {return name;}; void setColor(string s) {color &#x3D; s; return;}; string getColor() {return color;}; }; Fruit* a &#x3D; new Fruit(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;red&quot;); Fruit* b &#x3D; new Fruit(&quot;banana&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;); int main() { Fruit currentFruit &#x3D; (*a); bool keepGoing &#x3D; true; while (keepGoing) { cout &gt; newColor; currentFruit.setColor(newColor); cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\nokay, now &quot;&lt;&lt; currentFruit.getName() &lt;&lt; &quot; is &quot;; cout &lt;&lt; currentFruit.getColor() &lt;&lt; endl; if (currentFruit.getName() &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;apple&quot;) { currentFruit &#x3D; (*b); } else { currentFruit &#x3D; (*a); } } return 0; }

                              <span>I was just wondering if there is any good tool to automatically refactor big c++ code bases (ie thousand of files). For instance being able to rename certain kind of variables to change the naming convention, updating comments, doing custom rule checks. No matter how complex it is to write the rules, but then the process should be automatic for all the files. 
 I saw some papers about tools used by Google, but no &quot;almost-ready&quot; solution. 
 I was hoping about something based on clang. Suggestions? Using msvc or clangcl atm. 
 I guess in the future we&#x27;ll have AI to do these things , but we are not there yet...

                              <span>A new release of TeaScript is done.
 (TeaScript is a standalone as well as an embeddable multi-paradigm script language in and for C++.)
 All details to this release can be found in the blog post:
 https://tea-age.solutions/2024/05/15/release-of-teascript-0-14-0/
 Summary of this Release
  
(automatically) compile and execute TeaScript files in the new integrated Tea StackVM.
 Save and Load compiled TeaScript programs as TeaScript Binary files (*.tsb).
 Suspend and Continue TeaScript programs at (nearly) any time by either themselves, by maximum time or instruction constraint or by an external request from another thread.
 Use TeaScript code similar like a coroutine in your C++ Application by yielding values from any place and co-operative / preemptive execution possibilities.
 Nerd feature: program directly in TeaScript Assembly.
 improved debugging capabilities with single stepping, view the callstack, view corresponding source code and more.
 Opt-out header only library usage for save includes and compile time.
  
The TeaScript C++ Library is also on Github:
 https://github.com/Florian-Thake/TeaScript-Cpp-Library
 Enjoy! 😊

                              <span>I need to input 2 values &lt; 40, 2 chars basically, and get a char &lt; 40 out. However the order should not matter. (2, 3) should return the same value as (3, 2). An array of arrays would work but would also waste space since it would be mirrored across the diagonal. I think an unordered_map would work but I&#x27;d need help on how to hash 2 chars which I&#x27;m not well versed on. All values are compile time constants and speed is a factor. Thanks.

                              <span>I have been coding in C++ for around 6–7 months now. I went to look at the junior roles available out of curiosity, and there is literally nothing—not one single job listing—and I’m starting to feel discouraged about continuing with it, especially seeing as I will have to put in another year or two worth of studying. I get that C++ is harder for an “entry-level” language, but if no company wants to hire juniors, how are people who code solely in C++ supposed to get their foot in the door?

 I am looking for a library, which can produce a graphical output in a window (kind of like graphics.h, but a little less outdated) for use in a raycast renderer, which will get implemented into a Doom-Style FPS game. I&#x27;m kind of new to C++, and would appreciate some help in finding such a library.

                              <span>Hello there! I&#x27;m relatively new to the process of making a standalone application, so I&#x27;m having a bit of an issue right now.
 Screenshot of what the issue looks like: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/756550550279028737/1240234870731571261/image.png?ex&#x3D;6645d23b&amp;is&#x3D;664480bb&amp;hm&#x3D;ffda7ade3a6be63b65eae24a3fd09f527b511931c2bd89f38e5df9c18c82202c&amp;
 I&#x27;m using ImGui docking and I&#x27;m trying to get this window on the right (the one that says &quot;Keys Down&quot;) to have a transparent background with just the text overlaying the screen. All of the appropriate flags for the window are enabled, no title bar, no decorations and no background. As a result, as long as the window is within the bounds of the main window of the app, it appears as just text without a background, just how I intended.
 However, as soon as I try to drag this window outside the bounds of the main viewport, the dock gets a black background that I don&#x27;t want there. Does anyone know what might be causing this and how to fix it? I&#x27;m rendering this using DirectX10 in case it matters.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I know the different data structures, but I wonder if one were to master using std::vector in C++, if he&#x27;d be able to product efficient, and great code in general?
 As long of course the project doesn&#x27;t have specific constraints (if it needs speed, maybe hashtables for quick insertion, deletion, lookup using std::unordered_map would be a better choice, maybe if we need something with less memory overhead and won&#x27;t do dynamic allocation, maybe going for std::arrays etc etc)
 It&#x27;s an honest question since I&#x27;m hearing a lot from programmers (Even Bjarne Stroustrup says its a good default unless you have reason not to) that they mostly use vectors in C++ for all types of applications because they&#x27;re so powerful.

 Write a program using object oriented programming techniques that reads a comma separated list from a file into memory and print the contents.
 Sort by surname then first name prior to displaying it.
 File format: First_Name, Second_Name, Age.
 eg: Fred,Smith,35
 Andrew,Jones,23
 Sandy,Daivs,27
 Entries should be displayed as:
 First Name: Fred
 Second Name: Smith
 Age: 35
 How would you have solved this? I got it to read in but never finished the sorting part.

                              <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;m wondering if any of you would like to contribute and help me improve my project using C++. Let me give you a bit of background: I&#x27;m a student currently studying computer science at university. I have this C++ project that I&#x27;ve recently been working on, and I&#x27;m using Qt for its interface. It&#x27;s basically an application that helps you organize files. I&#x27;m wondering if any of you would be willing to help me enhance and improve my program to make it more user-friendly.

                              <span>I happen to really like cmake so I&#x27;ve become decent at it, but I was wondering if the following file is really bad in anyway:
 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.25) project(BinaryLoader CXX) # Set the path of where &#x27;Qt6Config.cmake&#x27; is set(QT6_Path /home/frank/Qt/6.7.0/gcc_64/lib/cmake/Qt6) find_package(fmt REQUIRED) find_package(Qt6 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Core Gui Widgets PATHS ${QT6_Path}) add_executable(binary_loader) add_subdirectory(BinaryLoader) target_include_directories(binary_loader PUBLIC ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/BinaryLoader/include) target_compile_options(binary_loader PRIVATE $: -fsanitize&#x3D;address,leak,undefined -pedantic -Wall -Wextra -Wconversion -Wundef -Werror -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-variable &gt; ) target_link_options(binary_loader PRIVATE $: -fsanitize&#x3D;address,leak,undefined &gt; ) set_target_properties(binary_loader PROPERTIES CXX_STANDARD 23 ) target_link_libraries(binary_loader PRIVATE fmt::fmt Qt6::Core Qt6::Gui Qt6::Widgets ) 
 I build with
 conan install . --output-folder build --build&#x3D;missing -s build_type&#x3D;Debug -pr:b&#x3D;default cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE&#x3D;Debug -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS&#x3D;1 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE&#x3D;build/conan_toolchain.cmake . -GNinja cmake --build build 
 And for completeness sake, here&#x27;s my conanfile.txt
 [requires] fmt/10.1.1 [generators] CMakeDeps CMakeToolchain 
 It&#x27;s nothing crazy and adding to it is really easy with the addition of add_subdirectory. I just want some feedback :)

 But, here I am, gladly typing to your information that FreeBSD, another alternative OS, now has a full port of the .NET 8 environment, thanks to the hard work of Gleb Popov!!!
 .NET 8 port
 Now, we have another solid alternative to C#/.NET dev workloads!

                              <span>Hello, coding newbie here,
 I&#x27;ve recently started learning Rust, mainly because a) it looks more fun than R (is R even considered a programming language? idk) which I begrudgingly use everyday and b) It seems like Rust&#x27;s main focus is to minimize memory issues during runtime, which is of great interest to me. Right now I&#x27;m reading the Rust Book and having a lot of fun, but I know to truly step up my game I need to do a personal project.
 Thing is, I don&#x27;t know what to do. I came across a random comment from a different subreddit talking about their setup, and it seemed like they made their own music player (I&#x27;m not sure if this is the correct term, what I mean is programs like foobar2000, itunes, etc), and that caught my eye. I like music, and I&#x27;ve never had a music player that perfectly suits my needs, so I think it&#x27;ll be a pretty fun challenge to make one myself, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s going to be too hard for me.
 I pretty much have absolutely no coding experience. Yes, I&#x27;ve said I used C/C++ before, and because of my line of work requires some knowledge of Python I learned that as well, but I only know them at a surface level. So going back to the question - Will making a music player be too hard for me? Should I do something simpler first?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I take my notes in plain markdown using NeoVim, and I wanted preview the files directly in the terminal. NeoVim itself works, but it wasn&#x27;t &quot;pretty&quot; enough. I tried Glow, but following links didn&#x27;t work as I wanted. So I created MD-TUI. It has a file browser which finds all markdown files recursively. Optionally use gitignore to filter out some.
 I decided to write my own grammar for the markdown language, so it does not follow a specification 100%, but create an issue if you feel like it doesn&#x27;t parse something correctly. Most of the common markdown syntax should be supported.
 If your terminal support some image protocol, it can also display images. Syntax highlighting is supported for some languages, and I am adding more as we speak.
 The biggest feature I have not seen other do, is a &quot;select link&quot; mode which allows you to scroll through the links in the file and follow them. Does not matter if it&#x27;s a link to a heading, another file, or external URL to a website.
 Would be awesome to hear your thoughts.
 Edit: should have said it does not follow a specification 100%

It&#x27;s on repeat in my head like the Power Rangers theme song. Anyway, I found this random blog post to be really helpful. Especially the perseptive of persistence and work ethic. It was really grounding for me- just keep practicing. Anyway, I thought others might find it helpful too.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a university lecturer in Switzerland, teaching web development basics to my students. As part of their coursework, they need to create a small web app using real-world data from APIs.
 While searching for reliable and relevant APIs, I stumbled upon the famous Public API List on GitHub. While checking out the list, I found that many of the APIs are no longer free, no longer public or have been discontinued.
 To address the problem of outdated APIs, I created a small website called freepublicapis.com, which contains my collection of APIs and tests all endpoints every four hours. The site logs responses and measures metrics such as response time and error rate. Currently, there are 28 APIs available, many of which are from Swiss public institutions.
 If you know any cool APIs from your city or country, that helped you learn programming, it would be fantastic if you could contribute them to the website. Your participation could make this website relevant to students learning web development around the world.

                              <span>There are lots of great YouTube channels where the creator tackles an interesting project in a single video or over a couple of videos; Coding Train being a great example. Not one of these channels uses C.
 Is YouTube’s algorithm just letting me down or are all the C videos on that platform really just tutorials for beginners or videos asking if C is obsolete?
 If anyone knows of any channels like the Coding Train but using C, so I don’t have to subject myself to JavaScript, I’d be most grateful for a recommendation.

                              <span>I am totally new to C and started implementing algorithms. I come from Java and m-script. I wrote some matrix algorithm in C and it was a total pain. Allocating memory and writing functions for everything, adding header files... Every function has pointers/arrays sent in and gives a result and the result has to be saved. Arrays has to be initialized all the time. Several loops for every step... Is it supposed to be like this?
 It is crazy fast when it runs, but so hard to work with. What are your advice to simplify things?

                              <span>I created a simple REPL in C that reads a line of input and prints it back, while saving the history of inputs entered by the user. Before you judge me as a noob (I don&#x27;t mind that tbh), listen.
 Why create a stupid REPL?
 Well, creating a basic REPL that reads input until the user hits ENTER is straightforward. However, allowing the user to navigate through input history with the UP and DOWN arrow keys is more challenging because:
  
Immediate Input Handling: You don&#x27;t get what the user typed until they hit ENTER. This is problematic because users expect the previous command to be displayed immediately upon pressing the UP arrow key.
 Raw Mode and Escape Sequences: To handle user input on each key press, the terminal input must be in raw mode. And once you&#x27;re in raw mode, say bye bye to the default behavior of the terminal like CTRL+C to exit, CTRL+D to send EOF, or something as simple as backspace handling. You have to handle all of these manually. In fact, you have to responsible for writing back the character that the user types to the terminal.
  
You can read more about raw mode and escape sequences in my notes:
  
Raw mode: https://github.com/biraj21/echo-repl/blob/main/notes/raw-mode.md
 Escape sequences: https://github.com/biraj21/echo-repl/blob/main/notes/escape-sequences.md
  
Btw this stupid REPL is roughly 500 lines of (probably buggy) code!
 Source code: https://github.com/biraj21/echo-repl
 Please go through the README once to understand the behaviour of history in this implementation.
 Motivation? Needed it to follow https://buildyourownlisp.com/ book, and I was unable to build the library suggested there on my Mac.
 Would appreciate your feedback. Thanks!

                              <span>So I created a simple neural network in C. I was inspired by tsoding daily&#x27;s playlist Machine Learning in C. I was looking for neural network tutorial but unfortunately everything was in python. This guy&#x27;s video was only one I could find that was in C.
 So here is my simple NN. It&#x27;s fully connected only. And I&#x27;m only using Finite Difference as the learning algorithm. I&#x27;ll post here again after I learn back propagation.
 Anyway, here&#x27;s the link and all feedback is welcome: https://pastebin.com/c2KUExvb

 I have tried to implement Game of Life using SDL, the main goals of the project was to make the program as efficient as possible with my knowledge and add interactivity, enhance the user experience

                              <span>Does anyone know of a good tool to visualize dependencies of a project? I&#x27;m trying to sort through a project&#x27;s kind of convoluted include network of headers and source files and it&#x27;d help untangle things if I could visualize it a bit better.

                              <span>I&#x27;m completely new to C, so I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m doing, so excuse me if this is a really dumb question.
 I&#x27;m using VSCode and on an M-Series Macbook.
 I&#x27;m trying to include the cglm library to my C project, but the C compiler just isn&#x27;t detecting the cglm header file. Intellisense does detect the cglm header file (it auto-suggests the file), and no errors are raised until I try to run my program.
 c_cpp_properties.json file:
 { &quot;configurations&quot;: [ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;macos-clang-arm64&quot;, &quot;includePath&quot;: [ &quot;${workspaceFolder}/**&quot;, &quot;/Users/maxshi/Desktop/cglm/include/cglm&quot; ], &quot;compilerPath&quot;: &quot;/usr/bin/clang&quot;, &quot;cStandard&quot;: &quot;${default}&quot;, &quot;cppStandard&quot;: &quot;${default}&quot;, &quot;intelliSenseMode&quot;: &quot;macos-clang-arm64&quot;, &quot;compilerArgs&quot;: [ &quot;&quot; ] } ], &quot;version&quot;: 4 } 
 tasks.json file:
 { // See // for the documentation about the tasks.json format &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.0.0&quot;, &quot;tasks&quot;: [ { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;echo&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;shell&quot;, &quot;command&quot;: &quot;echo Hello&quot;, &quot;args&quot;: [ &quot;-I&quot;, &quot;/Users/maxshi/Desktop/cglm/include/cglm&quot; ] } ] }https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId&#x3D;733558 
 launch.json file:
 { &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.2.0&quot;, &quot;configurations&quot;: [ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;C/C++ Runner: Debug Session&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;lldb&quot;, &quot;request&quot;: &quot;launch&quot;, &quot;args&quot;: [], &quot;cwd&quot;: &quot;/Users/maxshi/Desktop/c test&quot;, &quot;program&quot;: &quot;/Users/maxshi/Desktop/c test/build/Debug/outDebug&quot; } ] } 
 The error:
 main.c:2:10: fatal error: &#x27;cglm.h&#x27; file not found #include  ^~~~~~~~ 1 error generated.

                              <span>Hey. I just want to know if the C Essentials course from OpenEDG is worth it.
 As far as I know it&#x27;s free, so I just wanted to know if it would be a waste of time since I could just use books (A Modern Approach and K&amp;R for example).

                              <span>I am running debian 12 on my old HP laptop without a battery as a personal server that I SSH into. The laptop is designed in such a way that it does not use a CMOS battery which is supposed to be supplimented by power from the battery. Everything works all smooth considering that the laptop is always powered. Any blackout requires me to manually set the time every time. This only happened after I switched to Debian, before I was running Kali (I know its a dumb using Kali as a server) and the time auto updated itself.
 1. what could I have gone wrong when doing the Debian setup?
  
Could the battery really affect the time setup?

                              <span>Recently this profile has been trending on this sub and I feel like many people in this sub compare themselves to people like this and feel defeated before ever going into industry. Its the wrong feeling to have because this profile is FAKE. there’s so many things wrong with it that its not even worth thinking about for too long because no one has ever done all this. they could not have majored in CS,Econ,DS as that combined major didn’t exist until 2017. MIT also doesn’t use 4.0 as their GPA scale, its 5.0. You can backtrack and find this person on LinkedIn, then try finding them on the MIT alum database that’s publicly available, the only person with that name did not major in CS nor did they graduate when this profile claimed they did. There’s no published research mentions on google scholar either for this guy, incredibly unlike for a stanford phd. In short, its a fake. 
 Unless i missed out on the joke, i can’t believe so many people think this is real.

                              <span>Hey everyone! I&#x27;ve been working on open source SDKs for Android and iOS that export OpenTelemetry signals. I&#x27;m really excited about this because observability SDKs have traditionally used proprietary schemas, making it hard to export and analyze production data.
 Our mobile-native SDKs use OpenTelemetry Traces and Logs, and capture mobile-specific signals such as network requests, status codes, screen views, error logs, crashes, and more.
 Here’s our github repo: https://github.com/embrace-io
 You can use a generic OTel exporter to send mobile telemetry captured by our SDK to any OTel backend like Jaeger, Zipkin, or Grafana, or send it to Embrace itself. Plus, we’re enabling mobile teams to instrument any software component or service using OpenTelemetry and gather the data in the Embrace backend. This data can be visualized and live alongside data captured by first-party solutions.
 Full disclosure: I work for Embrace.io but would really appreciate your thoughts and feedback

                              <span>Preface: I am a complete noob.
 With the move to kubernetes/microservices/containerization why aren&#x27;t languages that use BEAM more popular? I can understand the desire to make services language agnostic for a number of good reasons, but to me personally that doesn&#x27;t seem worth the tradeoff of managing a glut of different tools to accomplish essentially the same goal. I haven&#x27;t invested the time to delve into erlang/gleam/elixir too deeply, but from the outside it appears that concurrency is handled leagues above what is possible with kubernetes. I will still take the time to learn each approach, but I am very curious what everyone else thinks about this.
 Edit: BEAM) is the Virtual Machine associated with Erlang and similar languages

                              <span>Please, I come here to be educated and admit that I do not know everything. Especially being new in this space and this role. I am very much open to constructive discussion. 
 My developer is asking for admin privileges to set up our GitLab CI/CD pipeline. He needs to access the access key and the secret access key for the existing AWS prod account. 
 Of course, following best practices, we will not be giving him admin access. 
 How do you suggest going about this?
 From prior research, I may do RBAC. AWS Managed policies are too permissive, but what about implementing Customer Managed Policies? Am I in the ballpark? Or not even close?
 Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I work in FAANG, have almost 5 yoe now. And although I’m confident about my coding abilities, I still feel this with every new project or crash/bug I get assigned.
 I don’t know if it’s imposter syndrome. Basically, it’s hard for me to not feel stressed about the task until I have a plan of action. What this means is that I stay up late until I figure out the puzzle - like what classes I can reference to build this feature, or potential root causes for the crash that I can test out tomorrow. 
 But it’s hard for me to “clock out” mentally from work if I am left with a problem I have no immediate plan of action/solutions for. 
 Has anyone else experienced this? Curious to know if this is a type of imposter syndrome and how to deal with it.

                              <span>For context, I am an asian and English is my second language. Currently working in Australia as a software developer with a 12 years of experience.
 I&#x27;ve already opened up this issue with my TL and CTO during our 1:1 and was told they understand me just fine and that they&#x27;re happy that I do my job really well, however, I feel it still holds me back to become better at what I do.
 Here are the problems: 1. Collaborating with others - Internally, I understand what the block of code does and what it is for. I don&#x27;t have any issues communicating this in slack because I get more time to format what I need to say and also use chatGPT to polish it so I can express it more clearly. However, I struggle to verbalise it when I am in the office because I was being conscious with my grammar and the way I speak, sometimes I would overexplain myself to a point I don&#x27;t understand what I am saying anymore and get lost.
  
Visualising concepts - I struggle to understand what my teammate is saying if I don&#x27;t have any previous knowledge to it. I feel like I am stupid and wasting their time asking to explain again for me to understand and still don&#x27;t understand a thing. Furthermore, I don&#x27;t know what questions to asks so I could at least contribute in our discussion.
  
Anyone have the same experiene and how did you overcome it? I am attending a toastmaster at the end of this month hopinh it would help me.

 I&#x27;ve worked just over 18 months in a team lead position at a prestigious tech company, and despite making more money than ever, it has been the worst 18 months of my life mentally, and it&#x27;s reached a point where I feel physically sick 24/7. I think I flew too close to the sun making this career move, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m cutout for the rapid context switching, people management, meetings, and endless Slack messages. I just want to code again. I&#x27;m worried that people will perceive me as a failure for giving up, and that I&#x27;m an idiot for walking away from a high paying job at a prestigious company.

                              <span>I am making my game as an Indie Dev titled Wildlife Rescue Simulator. It is a game inpired by YouTube videos of how people save different animals like Seals tangled in fishnets. I watch Captain Planet as a kid, I was a boy-scout and topic of nature preservation is important to me but I wouldn&#x27;t call myself an activist and my priority is to make this game fun. I setup Steam page and I gather Wishlists. I don&#x27;t have marketing budget so I post about my game on various social medias. Most of the times feedback is positive but there are some people who really don&#x27;t like the idea. But not only that. They call me &quot;leftist r*tard&quot; &quot;NWO shill&quot; and &quot;pinkhair soyboy&quot;. Someone even suggested that I should make &quot;H*mas t*rrorist Simulator&quot; next. I don&#x27;t take those words lightly. All I wanted is to make a game about rescuing animals, I wouldn&#x27;t in a million years assume that this will be controversial.

                              <span>After months of silence and on the launch date Apple just decided to reject our game for its &quot;paid content&quot; although our game contains no paid content.
 At least the game made it on android and we were able to launch regardless.

                              <span>Hi this is Chris Zukowski from HowToMarketAGame.com (Proof). Steam Next Fest is next month. I have been studying how games perform in Steam Next Fest since the first one back in 2020 (see links below for examples). 
 Ask me anything about marketing games on Steam and I will answer them here. Just note that I don&#x27;t know Mobile games marketing works. I don&#x27;t know consoles. I don&#x27;t know F2P. And I don&#x27;t know VR (they don&#x27;t sell well on Steam). But anything else I am an open book.

                              <span>SFTPGo is an event-driven file transfer solution. It support multiple protocols (SFTP, SCP, FTP/S, WebDAV, HTTP/S) and multiple storage backends.
 Main new features:
  
Rewritten WebClient and WebAdmin UIs: we hope you find these new user interfaces more modern and easier to use. They also include a dark mode.
 Documentation moved to sftpgo.github.io.
 Experimental support for internazionalization.
 Time-based access restrictions.
 Allow to require password change and two-factor authentication also for admins, before it was possible only for users.
 Allow to automatically disable or delete inactive users.

                              <span>We recently found a bit of a growing bottleneck in our multi-tenant architecture. At the basic level, our multi-tenant system is event-driven and user code can dynamically create event-matching expressions at runtime that need to be evaluated on all incoming events in our event stream. We recently made some big optimizations for matching by turning expressions into ASTs then moving the expressions themselves into in-memory hash maps using xxhash for string matches and btree (shout out to &#x60;tidwall/btree&#x60;) for number matching and comparison. 
 We thought it was an interesting problem, so I came to share our code and the blog post with more info on how we solved it. Anyone else have any experience with something like this? Something we can improve or do better?

                              <span>When I first started learning go, I was initially confused by &quot;interface&quot; in go. Like, when I explored the codebase in my company, it was used as something that interface isn&#x27;t supposed to be. 
 It was after a while I realized interface could also be used as any data type. It was also when I realized go has any data type. 
 But why this way? Why did they have to call any as &quot;interface&quot;? Why didn&#x27;t they just call it any straight away? 
 I&#x27;m also aware at the fact that now go has introduced &quot;any&quot; as any along with generics feature. But iirc it&#x27;s just an alias of &quot;interface&quot; data type. And I feel lots of devs still prefer to use &quot;interface&quot; instead of &quot;any&quot; to declare the any data type.

 Need some help on how to mock the AWS *s3.Client. Currently have this kind of function:
 func downloadObject(ctx context.Context, client *s3.Client, bucketName string, serialNumber string, key, downloadPath string) { listObjectsInput :&#x3D; &amp;s3.ListObjectsV2Input{ Bucket: &amp;bucketName, Prefix: &amp;key, } // List objects resp, err :&#x3D; client.ListObjectsV2(ctx, listObjectsInput) . . . 
 what is the right way to mock the client *s3.Client?
 thank you for response

 The issue is, the touchscreen interface stuff (IE, new gnome shell versions, wayland gesture improvements, etc) keeps getting better, but seems to always be on the bleeding edge. 
 Would it be worth trying Arch on this device?

 I&#x27;ve found this explanation, but I compile with cmake.
 If I comment out these lines inside cstdlib it compiles without error, but I shouldn&#x27;t be modifying a standard library header... Can anyone explain?

 This is my problem. I have a templated struct S which has the compare function. But when I do specialization which inherits from another class the compare function is no longer available in my specialization. Why is that?

                              <span>As you know, one of the main gripes with C++ development is related to compilation time. Compiler vendors constantly strive to make improvements in this area, in spite of new STL features being constantly added. C++26 is going to be quite special in this regard though afaik, having the reflections proposal accepted. Reflections being probably the biggest metaprogramming extensions ever added to the language, even bigger than concepts and require clauses.
 I&#x27;m saying this because I was watching this particular talk by Alexander Fokin describing it: https://youtu.be/FqzrQf6Xr8g?si&#x3D;oe6L0askoOzQjSlC&amp;t&#x3D;3592 . What immediately caught my attention was the example of how you could implement std::tuple (almost fully) in what? 20 lines of code? For reference, MSVC&#x27;s implementation is a header with more than 1000 lines of code ( https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/main/stl/inc/tuple ), containing dozens of helper class template instantiated for each instance of std::tuple used in real code. A fair assumption would be that the std::meta version would be far faster to compile, reflections being a very straight-forward way of expressing your intent to the compiler. In real life scenarios this could results in an immense amount of time saved at compilation time. And better yet, the opportunity of rewritting std::tuple would be a big bonus too since none of the standard implementations are optimal ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ilujab/it_turns_out_stdtuple_is_not_a_zerocost/ ).
 Again, I&#x27;m not talking just about std::tuple here, I&#x27;m assuming there are dozens of STL components that could use being rewritten using reflections, if for nothing else, at least for the sake of compilation time. I&#x27;m wondering if this new feature couldn&#x27;t be the push vendors have needed to take into consideration a real ABI break with one of their future releases, considering the compilation time improvements now available on the table.

                              <span>So, if 2020 marked the day the standard library died (allegedly), then what do I use instead?
 In other words and in a more serious tone: is there a &quot;best&quot; general-purpose C++ primitives library that could theoretically become &quot;the new stdlib&quot;, if we could magically disregard all existing code?
 Or in yet other words: is there a library, or a set of libraries, that I should seriously consider using instead of stdlib and STL (on performance, ergonomics and usability grounds) in new projects where backward compatibility and simplicity of deployment is not a concern?

                              <span>Trying to look this up and Im struggling to get a specific answer. My understanding is that if you don&#x27;t specify any of the Rule of 5, then all of them are made by default, but I&#x27;m not 100% certain of this.

                              <span>Hi all,
 My first job out of college has primarily involved writing code that runs in a real time Linux environment. The code I&#x27;ve written wasn&#x27;t the kind that focused on being ultra optimized. Instead, the focus was moreso on readability and reliability. We usually are not allowed to use most modern C++ features. Our coding standard is often described as &quot;C with classes.&quot;
 I have an interview coming up for a low latency position that also involves distributed systems. What would this kind of C++ development entail compared to what I&#x27;m currently doing?
 In other words:
  
What are some high level concepts I might want to familiarize myself with before the interview?
 
More broadly speaking -- if, against all odds, I manage to land the position, what new skills might I be learning? What might I need to study up on in my own time? What would my day to day development look like? How might this differ from the development of an embedded software engineer?
 
 Thanks!

                              <span>For the code look at https://godbolt.org/z/rdPnfqnY3.
 When compiling with MSVC, I get the following error:
  
error C3528: &#x27;Is&#x27;: the number of elements in this pack expansion does not match the number of elements in &#x27;Tuples&#x27;
  
In essence, I expand two packs in a single statement:
 else if constexpr ((std::is_void_v&gt; || ...)) 
 I am not too well versed with the spec to know if it is problematic or not. To me it seems obvious what it should expand to, for example if Is &#x3D; 0, 1 and Tuples &#x3D; Tuple1, Tuple2, Tuple3, then it should expand to:
 std::is_void_v&gt; || std::is_void_v&gt; 
 It is stranger that the code compiles with Clang or GCC. What&#x27;s even more stranger is when I refactor it
 template  constexpr bool tuple_void_output &#x3D; (std::is_void_v&gt; || ...); 
 and then use it as
 else if constexpr (tuple_void_output) 
 then it also works in MSVC (you can change the define from 0 to 1 to activate this refactoring in the godbolt link). My IDE (CLion) is giving red squiggles though with messages:
  
For the definition of tuple_void_output &quot;Template parameter pack must be the last template parameter&quot;
 When instantiating the template variable: &quot;Template argument for non-type template parameter must be an expression&quot;
  
So my questions:
  
Is there something wrong with my code?
 Which compiler is correct?

                              <span>I used GeeksForGeeks as a source to learn CPP. Coming out of an interview, I think what I learned is probably not very accurate. Reading further about people’s opinions on GeeksForGeeks, I think I may just be right.
 I now own C++ Primer by Stanley Lippman. People who used this book / a book to learn: any tips? 
 I plan to answer all the questions which come up. I’m worried that only doing this, I will most likely just forget everything I read. It is a very fat book.

 Do you know some good C++ library that can be used to simulate the behaviour of a watercolor brush on a paper?
 I was thinking to OpenGL, but I would like to check for something more specific. 
 Many thanks in advance

                              <span>Hey, not really a giving up moment but a rather sobering one, I have been learning C# for about 2 years now on and off (whenever time permits) and recently transitioned to C++. I started working with unreal and started messing around and found it rather simple.
 I then asked a programmer friend of mine for some tasks I could do to improve my knowledge, and suggested I try create a single Linked List, after multiple days, nothing, I could not figure it out to save my life. What bothers me is after looking up solutions online it looked like something extremely simple, and i realized just how much unreal does in the backend, now I just feel disheartened with a simple Linked List brought me to my knees. Anyways, not thinking of giving up, just more for those struggling to keep pushing and maybe some words of encouragement if this is the right place to ask/turn to. Thanks

                              <span>I thought it&#x27;d be nice to provide some type of modern wrapper around SDL, and I&#x27;ve been struggling to create a proper wrapper as you&#x27;d need to define a custom constructor for it. This is fraught with errors 
 auto make_unique_window(const std::string &amp;title, int x, int y, int w, int h) { auto window &#x3D; SDL_CreateWindow(title.c_str(), x, y, w, h, SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN); auto custom_deleter_for_sdl_window &#x3D; [window]() { SDL_DestroyWindow(window); }; std::unique_ptr some_window; return some_window; } 
 I also thought it would make sense to inherit from SDL_Window to add a constructor.
  class window : public SDL_Window {}; 
 but SDL_Window&#x27;s definition isn&#x27;t exposed to the user, and thus, it is an incomplete type. Thoughts on what I could do?
 Maybe something like
 namespace sdl { class window { private: SDL_Window* m_window; public: window(const std::string &amp;title, int x, int y, int w, int h) : m_ window { SDL_CreateWindow(title.c_str(), x, y, w, h, SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN) } {} ~window() { SDL_DestrowWindow(m_window); } }; } // namespace sdl 
 Usage would look like
 auto my_window &#x3D; sdl::window { &quot;Title&quot;, 480, 640, 256, 256 };

 I’ve been coding in C/C++ for over a decade, but I wouldn’t ever say I’m great enough to say submit commits to the Linux Kernel. 
 For the past 3 years I’ve deployed complex workloads into AWS Fargate/lambda for a large IoT company. 
 I want to take a step back and grab a really great C++ book. What would you recommend?
 Any other great resources, in a similar vein as the Crust of Rust on YouTube by Jon Gjengset.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have a basic C++ program I&#x27;m compiling just to test to make sure my VS Code works. On Windows, I got it to work just fine following Microsoft&#x27;s YouTube tutorial. On Kali Linux, however, I cannot get this damn error resolved... CTRL+SHIFT+B to build, it works perfectly:
  
* Executing task: C/C++: g++ build active file 
 Starting build...
 /usr/bin/g++ -fdiagnostics-color&#x3D;always -g &#x27;/home/kali/Documents/cpp files/deletehelloworld.cpp&#x27; -o &#x27;/home/kali/Documents/cpp files/deletehelloworld&#x27;
 Build finished successfully.
  
So I get a build finished successfully, ok cool, it worked. Now let&#x27;s run it and output hello world. I use &#x27;(gdb) Launch&#x27; and it tells me that I&#x27;m missing a launch task? This is extremely confusing as I&#x27;ve never had this issue even once on Windows.... 
 Here&#x27;s my launch.json, have no idea what this is or why I need it
 { &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.2.0&quot;, &quot;configurations&quot;: [ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;C++ Launch&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;cppdbg&quot;, &quot;request&quot;: &quot;launch&quot;, &quot;program&quot;: &quot;a.out&quot;, &quot;args&quot;: [], &quot;stopAtEntry&quot;: false, &quot;cwd&quot;: &quot;${workspaceFolder}&quot;, &quot;environment&quot;: [], &quot;externalConsole&quot;: false, &quot;MIMode&quot;: &quot;gdb&quot;, &quot;setupCommands&quot;: [ { &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Enable pretty-printing for gdb&quot;, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;-enable-pretty-printing&quot;, &quot;ignoreFailures&quot;: true } ], &quot;preLaunchTask&quot;: &quot;C/C++: g++ build active file&quot; } ] }

                              <span>I want to write a function that takes in a container of std::string, but I want to constrain the function to only accept SequenceContainers. Therefore, it should accept vector, list, forward_list, array, deque, but not queue, stack, setetc. Also I don&#x27;t want to limit my function to standard containers. How can I write a custom concept for this?

                              <span>I understand the difference between (++i and i++), but which is preferred. When learning cs50x and after that in C, I&#x27;ve always done postfix incrementaiton. Rcecetnly starting learning cpp from learncpp.com, and they strongly recommened us to use prefix incrementation which looks a bit weird. Should i make the change or just keep using postfix incrementation since Im more accustomed to it

                              <span>I do a lot of numerical programming and I often wonder if it would be faster to do a copy to gather my data into contiguous memory before running an operation.
 Is this something other programmers are asking themselves? I&#x27;d like to hear other people&#x27;s thoughts on this as unit strides in memory or fastest but you&#x27;re going to pay a hit for doing a copy to gather the data into contiguous memory.

                              <span>Blind is a garbage cesspit but reading it motivates me. It. shows that you don&#x27;t actually need to be smart to crack LC or get into Big Tech. I have seen mind numbingly stupid takes from people who work at Google,Meta, Snap, Uber, Pinterest, Two Sigma etc. If brain dead morons can crack LC and get into FAANG so can you.
 So if you are struggling with LC just stick with it. I guarantee you it&#x27;s not an intelligence thing. Several Meta employees have confirmed they basically just memorized the top tagged Meta LC list. These people are not high iq geniuses. If you need to memorize or do the same top tagged problems over and over then do so. Some companies , cough...Meta, expect you regurgitate answers anyways so don&#x27;t feel guilty or shame with having to memorize answers for the most common LC hards asked in interviews.

                              <span>Recently got contacted by a Big G recruiter. They now send over a Hiring Assessment consisting of 100 Agree/Disagree questions. I pass that, so I assumed I would go to the tech screen next. A week passes and the recruiter finally sends me an email telling me I need to &quot;continue developing my skills&quot; and no feedback. Their auto-email also mentions that I have a 6-9month reapply waiting period. I&#x27;m fine getting denied, but don&#x27;t tell me to improve my skills when you reached out to me and I haven&#x27;t even done the interview yet...
 It is insane that some recruiters hold the entry door for some of the highest paying jobs in our field. Guess I now have a re-apply waiting period due to a bad recruiter. 
 P.S&gt; Seems like Big G is even outsourcing recruitment to outside the US. Avoid these recruiters if you don&#x27;t want to get screwed for no reason.

 Management has just told us that because we&#x27;re hourly, we won&#x27;t be getting paid during this outage. I&#x27;m still here at my desk waiting for the servers to come up. I still have to attend meetings on teams when they happen. This can&#x27;t be legal can it? I&#x27;m in the US.

 I feel like this couldn’t have happened at a worse time. The job market is absolutely terrible right now and my severance package will only last me a month and a half so I’m honestly terrified. If anyone is dealing with the same right now any advice is welcome.

                              <span>Recently the CEO and CFO of our mid size startup (300+) company have been bugging the engineers (15 SWEs), with new changes they want to implement. It is a flat hierarchy for the engineers with one Engineering VP. Recently, they told one of my work friends that other departments have people be held accountable for mistakes and publicly talk about “lessons learned” and things to make us grow. They said they have no insight on what the tech team does (we are the only full remote team) and want us to be like the other depts and talk about our failures, what we did wrong, what bugs we caused, and how we fix them. This seems so strange. We will sometimes have these talks internally with our own teammates but to publicly put us on blast in front of the whole company, or at least the top dogs? They don’t even mention our successes, why they hell do they want our failures? But anyway, I have a meeting with these execs tomorrow to “pick my brain” and because I was made aware of this beforehand, I’d love some advice on a good rebuttal that won’t get me fired or have a target on my back.
 Edited to add: The CTO either resigned or was fired, we don’t actually know since it was very ominous and quick. I see now that our CTO did a great job shielding the team from the execs because they are now suddenly joining our meetings and getting more involved.

                              <span>Hey guys, As we are nearing the end of the production of our game, I’ve been playtesting the heck out of it.
 I’ve caught myself playing quite a few hours and I genuinely enjoy my game. But it makes me wonder if I am not being delusional in my enjoyment. So what makes you go: I have a good game loop?
 Play testers seemed to have greatly enjoyed the game but I worry the sample size is too small.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in contact with this publisher for several months, they really liked the game but never went on with an offer, saying they needed at least another build update to compare and make an evaluation.
 Months passed and we got back in contact as we had a build update, but once again they didn&#x27;t go with an offer as they thought we weren&#x27;t gathering enough wishlists for them to feel confident, they gave us some slides with their in-depth evaluation which we actually appreciated, then basically closed contact as it&#x27;s clear they&#x27;re not interested...
 ...Until a new game demo just came out on steam, with a strikingly similar concept, execution, and even short/long descriptions.
 This is supposed to be the debut project of a &quot;three-person team&quot; (just how we presented ourselves to the publisher), &quot;coincidentially&quot; Chinese, but it&#x27;s impossible to track who&#x27;s behind.
 What is even weirder is the marketing quality and precision of this game and its usage of Steam algorithm and events, which is too much of a coincidence to assume that they were just doing everything right on the first try as a studio.
 Cherry on the cake is that we received this publisher&#x27;s report the same day they put their demo out and started engaging with their discord.
 I don&#x27;t think the concept of &quot;stealing ideas&quot; even exist, my game itself is a re-elaboration of other devs ideas, but the fact that we directly came in contact with this publisher and everything is laid out to look like a coincidence, still makes me feel viciously stolen of something.
 Thanks for reading up to this point.
 Curious to hear any thoughts you have about this.
  
EDIT: I care to specify that I don&#x27;t have 100% proof that this isn&#x27;t just the biggest coincidence I&#x27;ve witnessed in my life, it&#x27;s just an educated guess. The publisher I got in contact with itself said that they&#x27;re under the &quot;big hand of Chinese gaming&quot;, so they don&#x27;t even need to publish it under their own name.

                              <span>So, I did all the basics of math in school and I took an upgraded course before I could study comp. science at university.
 I was bad at it, and Math doesn&#x27;t actually interest me. The sciences never did, so it&#x27;s weird I&#x27;ve landed myself in Computer science, and truth be told, I&#x27;m not a particularly skilled programmer either. My field of interest lie in the aesthetics, the creative, and the collaboration of thinking of, and implementing games. I did just well enough in projects that I didn&#x27;t feel discouraged from the entire field, and now I still want to be a contributor in game dev. That said, I feel like math or just my inattention to detail is a problem.
 During the higher education I encountered a few instances where I would tell someone &quot;Err, so I don&#x27;t actually know how to write this&quot; and they&#x27;d say &quot;It&#x27;s just phytagoras. I can&#x27;t tell you what to do.&quot; and I had to figure something out on my own to make a cube move on the screen or something, and I ended up kinda not figuring it out, and I think eventually whoever said something about pythagoras did something on his own.
 And it&#x27;s not like I don&#x27;t know the pythagoras sentence, it&#x27;s just that in practice I suck at math and barely know how to apply it. I remember some shit we drew on a blackboard but it doesn&#x27;t come naturally to me to think mathematically.
 But now I&#x27;m facing specific needs like, I wanna figure out how to make an eye shader, cuz I have a 3D model where I&#x27;m dissatisfied with how glassy the eyes look. But people give me math stuff to figure it out. I&#x27;ll be running in circles with some design I&#x27;m trying to code until some smart guy shows me some x &#x3D; y2 + i &gt; 0 ???? math that apparently solves it in one sentence.
 So I&#x27;m a bit agitated by my lack of appliccable knowledge. Do you find that Math is important to your average game work? And if I were to learn about how to develop my own shaders, is there some kind of book that could help me?

                              <span>I always have a bit of writers block when it comes to this. I should probably just slap on a working title and go.
 I am reading advice that says &quot;Keep the game name short and not to use words a 7th grader cannot spell&quot;, but the problem is essentially this:
 1) Every freaking combination of common words are taken and potentially trademarked items (much like you can&#x27;t get the web domain name you want)
 2) Common words don&#x27;t fare well as a search term.
 3) Lots of successful games historically have featured a non-word or made up name.
 The title really makes or breaks the game in terms of mood or seriousness. Naming it something ambiguous like Nox Arcanum or Ultima sorta has the benefit that they don&#x27;t really &quot;say&quot; anything about the game, and do not constrain the developer in terms of story or design.
 And of course I don&#x27;t want to get sued if something is &quot;too close&quot; to something else. I have this paranoia that corporate behemoths are always going to try to squash indies that aren&#x27;t inside their financial tent. :D
 What do you guys do? Does anyone else find this decision absolutely paralyzing? I can think of a million parody names and say them in a Beavis &amp; Butthead voice, but coming up with a single serious and marketable name is exhausting.
 Should I just put a number on the end like a username? 😆 Fantasy Adventure 3000?
 I almost think Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was borne of this same frustration. &quot;Let&#x27;s just string a bunch of crap together that probably hasn&#x27;t ever occurred in sequence until now&quot; 😆

My coworker reviewed the PR, blocking it by requesting changes and shortly after opened their own PR fixing the same bug, requesting my review.
 Both PRs fix the bug and are technically correct, just do so in different ways. 
 I feel like this is bad etiquette and am wondering the best way to handle this situation. Its the first time I find myself in this specific situation with this dev, although I will note that they are somewhat opinionated and can sometimes be difficult to work with, but thats normal. Just looking for opinions on if I&#x27;m being too sensitive and how I should tackle this situation, if at all.

                              <span>I have a legacy app that’s written in node 12 using mongodb and elasticsearch. Data is denormalized through a large multistage pipeline. It’s incredibly slow, good UI response is around 5 second.
 Considering 99% of our data could be normalized. I pitched a migration to springboot and Postgres to management, and it looks like my team is will be allocated the time and budget.
 Has anyone mapped a large mongo database to SQL? Is there anything I should be weary of?
 My plan is to duplicate RMQ messages at the beginning of the pipeline, then run the legacy pipeline and the new pipeline in parallel. That way we can ensure data integrity and eventually backfill the old data.

This is catharsis for me more than anything, just writing what&#x27;s happened in the past year. I don&#x27;t expect anybody to read/care, this is for me: 
 Starting from a few days after the OG post was created:
  
Effective immediately, I was demoted from Team Lead while another took over the role (I was pretty okay with this actually, until boss made a big deal about it in an email to everyone. It was embarrassing.)
 Boss kept going hot and cold during our 1v1s; my attitude was not cheerful enough, or not serious enough, despite me checking in with new Team Lead multiple times a month (who sa…</span>

One of them is great, good attitude and when he makes mistakes always willing to improve. Good code reviews etc. The other one is horrible. I come to find out that my manager and him are friends and my manager hired him.
 I am at a loss for what to do to handle the situation. He was hired by my boss as a “Lead Data Engineer” but has absolutely no leadership skills. I myself am Indian, but have extreme difficulty understanding him, he also lacks comprehension. My boss has split his work into two teams, me and the other manager have 1:1s and he is also having having difficulty managing him on his side.

 Would also love recommendations if you have them!

                              <span>I think my org would benefit from a real-time linter, and I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to introduce it effectively and overcome cultural inertia. 
 The Java code base is 20+yrs old and has its scary places. There&#x27;s one group of (sharp) senior devs that have been working with it a long time, and a second off-shore group that is significantly less experienced. Experienced group likes one IDE; new group has been told to use a different IDE (and a few rebels (me!) use a third).
 I have two main concerns that I&#x27;m hoping the tool can help with: code formatting consistency across multiple IDEs (PR noise), and coding apprenticeship factors (&quot;Don&#x27;t copy that, it&#x27;s not a good example&quot;). I am tired of PRs where I&#x27;m looking for NPEs, seeing &#x27;if&#x27; statements that are 8 levels deep, and getting distracted by code moving from one line to the next because the line continuation moved. I&#x27;m hoping a lint-as-you-type tool would help with these types of issues, but I&#x27;m a bit overwhelmed on how to push it out. The new group is probably amenable, but the old group maybe not so much.
 Likely a phased approach is best, carrots over sticks, but what to prioritize in phase 1? Server side counts, or just let early adoption happen locally amongst the willing? Identifying &amp; disabling the rules that generate too much noise? Editor freedom?
 Edit: I ran a full scan on the repo today. To give an idea of the scale of the problem: 46K files, 399 modules, 156748 issues.

With everday use I mean for people who has no CS background but they need to learn how to code due to their jobs, e.g., someone in Finance who has to develop or run a machine learning model for predicting some trends in stock or bonus markets or someone working in Research and need to perform programming due their research is quantitative and they have to perform some coding.

 printf(&quot;Vrsta m: &quot;); scanf(&quot;%d&quot;,&amp;m); printf(&quot;Kolona n: &quot;); scanf(&quot;%d&quot;,&amp;n); printf(&quot;Unesi elemente matrice: /n&quot;); for(i&#x3D;0;i&lt;m;i++){ for(j&#x3D;0;j&lt;n;j++){ printf(&quot;element[%d][%d]: &quot;,i,j); scanf(&quot;%d&quot;,&amp;a[i][j]); } } for(i&#x3D;0;i&lt;m;i++){ for(j&#x3D;0;j&lt;n;j++){ printf(&quot;%d &quot;,a[i][j]); } printf(&quot;\n&quot;); } return 0;

 &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;
 This is my code, and the output looks like this....
 &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;
 Vrsta m: 2 Kolona n: 2 Unesi elemente matrice: /nelement[0][0]: 12345 element[0][1]: 12345 element[1][0]: 123456 element[1][1]: 123456 12345 12345 123456 123456
 [Program finished]
 &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;
 I want my numbers i am printing out, to have custom number of space that they go into...For example i want both the 12345 and 123456 numbers to have 10 blank spaces they can go into, if that makes any sense.

                              <span>Hi I&#x27;m a C newbie and I come from an ML background. I&#x27;ve been learning c for some time and I recently had a project idea that might make me slightly better at using C if I implemented some ml algos. So I was thinking of making a decision tree clustering algorithm, where I&#x27;ll substitute the criterion for measuring the variance with the f score and then use that for clustering algorithm. Just some idea had when I was studying decison trees and I wanna see if it works. 
 Is it even feasible? What approaches would you try? How can I do matrix multiplications and additions? Will I have to use the c for loops for that sort of thing, or is there a library for optimising the additions?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working in embedded C. The device receives ascii text one character at a time over a serial port and I would like to recognize when certain regex patterns appear in the stream. The character rate is highly variable and there are other tasks to perform, so I can&#x27;t simply block on the serial port and collect data as a string.
 What I want is something like PEARL with various rules and actions, but with a one-char-at-a-time input. And it has to play nice with other round-robin tasks.
 The goal would be to do something like stringRecognizer() in the code below. The pattern rules would be regex that are pre-compiled by the lex-generator for (e.g.) recognizing the strings &quot;CAT&quot;, &quot;DOG&quot; and &quot;PIG&quot; and returning an appropriate enum value that would trigger an action.
 The function is stateful, so it knows if it has seen (e.g.) C and then A, so a subsequent T would return ACTION_CAT but an R (or anything else) would return ACTION_NOT_DONE and move on. A D would also return ACTION_NOT_DONE but move the state into the DOG rule (so CADOG would eventually trigger the DOG rule). There might be a rule to reset the state machine when a new-line or carriage-return is seen.
 I&#x27;ve looked at lex, flex and re2c but none provides a stateful pattern recognizer. In all cases the state machine pulls data from either a string or an input stream, but is otherwise fully blocking. When the lex() function returns (to main()) all state is lost and restarts when a new string is supplied.
 while(1) { doTask1(); // blink led doTask2(); // read a sensor if (serialInputHasData()) { char c &#x3D; getch(); action_t action &#x3D; stringRecognizer(c); switch(action) { case ACTION_CAT: doCatFunction(); break; case ACTION_DOG: doDogFunction(); break; case ACTION_PIG: doPigFunction(); break; case ACTION_NOT_DONE: break; default: break; } } }

                              <span>When I look at the Assembly generated by the compiler from some simple code using standard library functions, I can&#x27;t find the code for the standard library functions that I used even though there are branches to those functions in the Assembly. Would this mean that standard library functions are dynamically linked or am I missing something?

 Why doesn&#x27;t the scanf call below work? It only prints the first name of an input. For instance, if the user inputs John Doe it only prints out Hello John! It seems as if the [^\n] is doing absolutely nothing. 
 #include  int main(void) { char name[20]; printf(&quot;What&#x27;s your name? &quot;); scanf(&quot;%19s[^\n]&quot;, name); printf(&quot;Hello %s!\n&quot;, name); return 0 ; }

                              <span>Does anyone have resources on how to go about learning asynchronous programming without multithreading? My previous experience with async programming has been with Go (which uses green threads managed by the runtime) and with Rust (which uses async-await and internally generates state machines that can cooperatively achieve asynchronous execution).
 Obviously, C is pretty bare bones, so I would be implementing the asynchronous mechanism from scratch. However, most resources online only show multithreading as a way to achieve async execution.
 EDIT: I understand that this might actually be impractical, which is why so much engineering effort is contributed to making languages such as Go. I&#x27;m mostly just interested in this for educational purposes.

                              <span>So right now I&#x27;m writing an arena allocator in C and I figured out how to silently initialize and free everything without the user having to do a single thing:
  #include &quot;arena.h&quot; int main() { void* p; for(int i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; 500; i++) { p &#x3D; arena_alloc(100); // similar to malloc } for(int i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; 50; i++) { p &#x3D; block_alloc(100, sizeof(int)); // similar to calloc } return 0; } 
 The arena which owns all the memory is getting initialized and freed automatically with no memory leaks (in fact it&#x27;s completely hidden from the user). So how is that possible?
 You can do this for almost any type of program but I&#x27;ll use my arena allocator as an example.

                              <span>AWS CLI and Elastic Beanstalk CLI use python. Is there a reason other than speed of development and pool of available talent that drives someone to use python over something like Go for CLI dev? I use both (mostly python) so I am just genuinely curious.

                              <span>Hello guys, I&#x27;m a TypeScript developer and have been fascinated by the performance of Go with GraphQL. However, I noticed that the go-graphql library is not maintained. After some research, I tried using gqlgen, but I didn&#x27;t like it—it felt cumbersome for creating an MVP. Are people still using GraphQL with Go? If so, how are you using it?

 Although not directly related to Rust, the concepts approached here showcase some amazing patterns that I would love to see be possible in Rust.
 There has also been some discussion of &quot;Must-Move Types&quot;, which can&#x27;t be dropped.
 To me, the patterns of &quot;Cache Tokens&quot;, and &quot;Owned Indexes&quot; are absurdly awesome!
 Tbh, just the idea of having destructors that can take parameters and return values is insane.
 But, like any awesome feature, it has its drawbacks... What do you guys think?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been diving deep into the world of Rust, and I&#x27;m constantly amazed by how elegant and powerful this language is. I&#x27;ve even started a LinkedIn page linkedin page where I share daily Rust tips and tricks that I discover along the way.
 But here&#x27;s the thing: I know I&#x27;ve only scratched the surface. The Rust community is full of brilliant minds, and I&#x27;m convinced that there are countless &quot;Aha!&quot; moments and hidden gems out there that I haven&#x27;t even encountered yet.
 So, I&#x27;m reaching out to all you fellow Rustaceans – what are some of the most mind-blowing, game-changing, or just plain cool Rust tips, tricks, or patterns that you&#x27;ve come across?
 Maybe it&#x27;s a clever way to use generics, a surprising application of lifetimes, or a subtle optimization that made your code run like lightning. Whatever it is, I&#x27;m eager to learn from your experiences and expand my Rust knowledge.
 Let&#x27;s share our collective wisdom and help each other become better Rust developers!

                              <span>When speaking to folks who have deployed Istio in production, I&#x27;m always surprised that only a few utilize anything more than mTLS. Sometimes they&#x27;re not even aware that if they don&#x27;t change the namespace defaults, they end up with the default service account attached to every pod, which means a single certificate is used for workload authentication—kind of defeating the purpose!
 Anyway, this is my attempt at demystifying Authorization Policies, Request Authentication, and OIDC/JWT user authentication workflows. Additionally, what if you could automatically generate Authorization Policies by letting a Network Mapper analyze your actual application traffic and pull metrics from Envoy directly? This is a very cool open-source project. Check out the details in the guide:

Apart from my working experience, I selfhost my lab with k3s with many services in it, setup nas, pi-hole,... I thought that was a hard and fun process, and when I have problem in my work, some experiences save me much time. So, anyone here list you homelab exp in your CV/resume? Please give me you thoughts, I&#x27;m really appreciated that.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I wrote a blog post comparing Loki and Quickwit on a simple log management use case. I&#x27;m working on Quickwit engine so I&#x27;m obviously biased but:
  
I tried, as best as I can, to balance my view on focusing on the tradeoffs between the two engines: basically Loki is faster at ingestion and Quickwit is faster at query time.
 I met many DevOps who were not understanding the architecture/datastructures/tradeoffs of Loki and Quickwit, I think it&#x27;s worth sharing the results at it will help users to make the right choice given their use case.
  
And I would love to get feedback on this, the benchmark code is available on github.

                              <span>Some might be aware of the old TomHarte/ProcessorTests repository, which was initially:
  
10,000 tests per opcode, for every 8-bit member of the 6502 family;
 each providing the before and after processor state for that opcode only, along with relevant memory values;
 with captured bus activity;
 expressed in JSON.
  
Over time that repository had become ungainly, covering additional processors and types of test gathered with varying degrees of rigour by a mix of authors.
 That resource has therefore given way to https://github.com/orgs/SingleStepTests/, an organisation rather than a single destination, allowing each repository to be:
  
much more focussed, on either a single processor or a small number of extremely-similar ones; and
 autonomously authored and maintained.
  
The old ProcessorTests repository also lingers there for now, but will be marked as archived in the near future.
 So: check it out if you&#x27;re working on a new processor emulation. Compared to traditional test programs all collections should be both more comprehensive and more communicative in the case of a digression.
 Also please don&#x27;t hesitate to contribute if you have the means to do so.

I&#x27;m asking because i&#x27;ve heard that alpine linux uses musl as its C lib and that&#x27;s the reason systemd is not available on it.

                              <span>Hi,
 Im looking for some books to improve my network code skills. I mainly use linux and have found some books already but im really interested in the architecture of networking (server) programs. Like using ring buffers, non blocking sockets, poll and so on. 
 Any good recommendations?

                              <span>Hi, i would like to receive some feedback on my first attempt at implementing a hash table in C, i did it a few months ago and now i&#x27;m going back to data structures, so, before continuing, i would like to know the good and bad things about my C code. Here is the implementation, i pasted it on pastebin because i think the code is long.

                              <span>finally done with the implementation of a single thread TCP server in C, with a basic event loop using the poll system call. it can handle multiple clients simultaneously while staying single-threaded. send a message, get it echoed back.
 source code: https://github.com/biraj21/tcp-server/
 pls note that i&#x27;m new to socket programming so the code might be prefect. there&#x27;s also a client to test the server. check README.
 i&#x27;m new to network programming. i&#x27;ve followed Beej&#x27;s Guide to Network Programming to get started with sockets, and other resources are mentioned in the README.
 summary of what i&#x27;ve done:
  
getaddrinfo() function to fill address details
 socket() system call to get a socket fd
 bind() it to an address and listen()
 event loop: create pollfd structs, starting with socket fd followed by connection fds
 use poll() with 0ms timeout
 process (recv() and send()) ready connections by checking pollfd&#x27;s revents field
 check socket&#x27;s pollfd struct to accept() new connections
  
i would appreciate your critiques.
 it&#x27;s amazing how so many complexities are taken care of by the abstractions in higher-level languages like php and node.js (ik it&#x27;s a js runtime).
 C ftw 🏎️

                              <span>Hello everyone, im following a uni course online about c programming, noticed that the professor keeps using the gets () function to get strings from users, but when i tried doing exercises i keep getting warning from the compiler about gets( ) being dangerous and that should not be used. Here are my questions : 1) in what sense is dangerous to use the gets( ) function? 2) are there some good options to actually get strings from user?, ive used scanf but it gets weird sometimes, so now tryng fgets but still sometimes act weird with stdin. Also is there a way to remove the &#x27;\n&#x27; i get when using fgets( )?. 3) why a professor is using a function that souldnt be used from probably more than 10 years? Hope those are not noob questions, any tips is welcome.

                              <span>I have started getting unto assembly and optimising code and I was wandering how important if at all is it to upgrade the computer I am using. 
 Currently I am on gcc 11.4 which feels fairly old at this point when I am looking at what&#x27;s out there.
 Are the differences between versions thst big or is it generally fairly unimportant

 I&#x27;m not sure if it is true or I&#x27;m just stupid or if it is true is it already known or I found first time? (Impossible)
 Sorry for bad hand writing. The idea is simple something like this:
 We give each other our public keys. You and me accomplish for two numbers (pre-partial-numbers that produce the pre-chain) and then we give each other their encrypted versions and then we have the final-chain (the protocol and client software can have common sorting and hashing as a reducer function... for example into a game card) After all each client software verifies the final chain with public keys of each peer and each peer will ensure that their pre-partial numbers are there inside and it is making the chaos for randomness because the common hasher/reducer function&#x27;s hash is gonna be unpredictable.
 The fact that&#x27;s providing this is that when peers encrypt their pre-partial-numbers with their private keys (RSA) there is no any pattern between them to predict and break the protocol safety. (Or there is? Idk.)
 If this whole thing is not bullshit, I will implement it in my game server.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hi all, hope all is well. I’m new to rust and I’m thinking what can I build in rust to learn it and also, appreciate it better. Like, I’m currently learning how to write a ray tracer in cpp and also, trying to build the same in rust and even though I’m just starting, I starting to feel that this is hard to start with. Can you please give me ideas on what I can build in some language I already know (python, c, cpp, clojure, js) and also, build the same in Rust and see how and why rust is better here. This way I want to appreciate it better. I know Rust is memory safe, cargo is king and all, but want to see it practically. Waiting for that aha moment. 
 Thank you all.

                              <span>I have made a prime number calculator and I don&#x27;t get the speed increase from rayon I&#x27;d expect. Here is the simple code behind it:
 let max &#x3D; args() .nth(1) .ok_or(eyre!(&quot;No argument provided&quot;))? .parse::()?; let mut primes: Vec &#x3D; vec![true; max + 1]; primes[0] &#x3D; false; primes[1] &#x3D; false; let max_check &#x3D; (max as f32).sqrt().ceil() as usize; eprintln!(&quot;Finding primes up to {}...&quot;, max); for i in 2..&#x3D;max_check { if primes[i] { // Single-threaded let mut j &#x3D; 2; while i * j &lt;&#x3D; max { primes[i * j] &#x3D; false; j +&#x3D; 1; } // Multithreaded using rayon primes .par_iter_mut() .skip(i * 2) .step_by(i) .for_each(|is_prime| *is_prime &#x3D; false) } } 
 It is a basic Sieve of Eratosthenes.
 In the multithreaded version the work of turning multiples of i into non-primes is spread across all 16 threads of my computer, however the execution time of both methods are essentially the same, even though every core is maxed out in the multithreaded version.
 Any idea why I don&#x27;t get a 16x speed increase? Does it have to do with rayon or is my code just bad?
 I have about 1 billion booleans in my array, so rayon seems like a good idea

                              <span>I know that experience &gt; certs, but sometimes you need certs just to get your foot in the door. 
 I have 3 years in IT (networking). I have a CCNA got my RHCSA last month, and expect to have AZ104 by the end of this month. I work at an MSP NOC and while we don’t do any DevOps, it looks like we will get some small cloud projects soon. So I’ll be able to get some cloud experience. 
 After I get my AZ104 what would be the next best cert to get out of the below?
  
AZ400
 RHCE
 CKA
  
While it’s been about 5 years, I did a Front end bootcamp. I forgot a lot but I’ve found that scripting comes pretty easy to me since I did spend time learning React.js, Git, HMTL, CSS, etc. So I’m also itching to pick up Python at some point. Probably wouldn’t be too hard for me to get the basics.

                              <span>A car mechanic does not need to go to school learning physics to know how a car works. They learn from others or see it with their own eyes. A physicist does not need to know the meaning of life and why we exist to understand the laws of physics. They never will. They learn from others or see it with their own eyes. A software engineer does not need to know how electricity works to write software. My point is, every subject matter expert becomes a “tinkerer” when you follow the branches of “but why does it work this way”. There is no point to this post, I was pondering the meaning of life while at the gym. Have fun with these thoughts in your head. :)
 [Edit] The car mechanic part isn’t true, I apologize for not researching this first.
 [Edit] I didn’t mean that learning things that are the “why” does not matter. They definitely do, being a SysAdmin or SWE before devops/cloud definitely makes you valuable. I just wanted you guys to think more about the meaning of life and love that you exist. Most of us probably spend a good chunk of our week working and lose time with family and our ourselves.
 [Edit] We’re all just Yaml Concocters
 [Edit Last Time] If you’re reading this and are actually getting upset over a reddit post, go touch grass. This was a thought experiment, of course people should learn the fundamentals.

 Today I published an article titled &quot;Recent Docker BuildKit Features You&#x27;re Missing Out On&quot; - Where I explore some of the recent features of BuildKit - the improved builder backend for Docker - including new Dockerfile syntax, built-in debugger and more
 Here&#x27;s the link: https://levelup.gitconnected.com/recent-docker-buildkit-features-youre-missing-out-on-a25aed8689fe
 Feedback is very much appreciated!

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;ll try to not make this another post about the job hunt, but was recently made redundant as a Cloud Engineer and was there for two years. I have been deskilled to some degree, but had experience with CI/CD and Azure DevOps for Terraform and Puppet.
 Since I started looking prior to this role, most &#x27;Cloud engineer&#x27; titles just wanted some basic understanding of these skills, Now, they&#x27;re mostly looking for people with fully developed skills and the title seems to have changed from Cloud Engineer to either Platform Engineer or DevOps. 
 I couldn&#x27;t find a subreddit for cloud engineering or the likes, and mostly did similar things to DevOps (to some degree at least?)
 So I want to ask a few things, if you&#x27;d be kind enough to provide your opinion.
  
What exactly does DevOps do in Python/Go? 
 I&#x27;ve got more Azure experience than AWS experience, should I go for a cert in AWS to cover the lack of experience? (It seems AWS is the go to, and I always preferred it. But I can&#x27;t afford to waste time in the wrong area.)
 If I can build new Docker Images, deploy and maintain, is there anything else that would be required to learn?
 If I have my GitHub linked in my CV, what would you expect to see? Is a tool with GUI for say, monitoring internet connections or retrieving data via an API okay? I suppose this linked to my first question. 
 Puppet or Ansible? Why? 
  
I&#x27;d appreciate any response, as I&#x27;m feeling pretty down about the situation.

                              <span>I have a pretty good devops skillset, fluent in python, groovy, bash. Extensive experience with AWS as a solution architect. I’m highly proficient writing terraform, using Jenkins, etc…. My biggest failing however is that I have no experience with K8s and everyone seems to be using it now (except my current company). I’m I’m a Senior Engineer/SA at a F500 company, but we’ve never gone down the containerization route. Any recommendations on good ways to get hands on experience with it on my own time?

                              <span>This is mainly for people working at a large company, as I imagine this would be less of an issue at a startup where everyone knows each other.
 My name is circulated semi-often as someone to contact when help is needed to fix issues in testing environments. From time to time, when someone reaches out to me for help, this is the entire message they send:
  
Hello u/idemockle
  
I have never talked to or heard of this person before, let alone know what they work on, so naturally I don&#x27;t respond immediately. This greeting message is left to sit for hours before the person tries to reach out again, and most of the time, when they do reach out again, they still do not give any introduction or background into what they want.
 Any tips on how to deal with this behavior? I feel kind of bad just not responding, but I also find it incredibly rude to reach out to someone you don&#x27;t know for help then make them have to pull teeth to get any information about it. Usually, I don&#x27;t respond until they give more context (if they ever do).
 I&#x27;m curious if others on here have encountered the same thing, if you think not responding is justified, and if not, then what you do to get the information you need in order to help without wasting a bunch of time on a back and forth.

                              <span>When I say PM I need the one who is supposed to do requirement analysis and translation. Whatever the title is -- sometimes it&#x27;s called Business Analyst too I think.
 Basically, I have never met even one good PM (or whatever you call it) in my 6+ years of experience. I think a good PM should worth the salary of one dev + one business side, and probably more if applicable.
 Sometimes I wonder why it is so difficult to grow one good PM. I suspect it has something to do with how corporations grow. In the beginning there is usually no middle man, and devs directly talk to the business. This is fine when it is still small -- but then business grows and experienced devs/business either leave or just care about their own stuffs. Then corp realizes that it needs some middle men -- but they rarely hire devs/businesses from the rank, instead hiring from externals -- those people might be good PM in their previous companies, but they are sort of useless in the new environment because each one has its own communication &quot;flavors&quot;. Then it needs another 2-3 years to grow those PMs, but how can they learn effectively if they neither go through business nor dev? It&#x27;s going to take much longer to learn the rope -- and that&#x27;s why we see so many echo chambers instead -- it&#x27;s not their fault, because they are not experienced in this specific environment, what else can they do?
 That leaves my conclusion that a company should always hire PM from experienced internal business or devs instead, and PM should be a senior position -- there should be no &quot;junior&quot; PM positions. What do you think?

                              <span>Encountering this problem a lot lately:
 Say I have an entity and a kafka topic related to that entity.
 I need to publish an event related to that entity once, and prevent further attempts to publish.
 I can have a &quot;published&quot; column in my db that I check before publishing the event.
 If !published, proceed to publish the event, then update published &#x3D; true for that row.
 The problem: if my publish succeeds, but my update fails, the column remains false for that row. If another publish attempt occurs, I will read !published again and try to publish when I shouldn&#x27;t.
 I could update the published column before the publish has occurred, but 1) this is an anti pattern since the publish hasn&#x27;t occurred yet and 2) if the db update succeeds but the publish fails, I&#x27;ll again have a column that is inaccurate.
 I suppose in this particular circumstance I could just roll back the db update - but that could also fail.
 If this happens 25,000 times in one day, I need to know which ones are inaccurate etc.
 Are there more sophisticated/elegant ways for handling this sort of problem?
 Edit:
 Thanks everyone for all the feedback. I guess I should add: there is UI involvement here where we want to allow the user to take the action that causes the publish only once. We want to disallow taking that action on the UI more than once. We also want to enforce the constraint in the backend. IMO it is bad design to let the user believe they can take action when they can&#x27;t. We could let them sit there and click buttons all day and just let the backend decide and return an error code when they shouldn&#x27;t have initiated the action, or we could stop them from taking the action in the first place which is what we&#x27;re doing.

                              <span>Sometimes, we get use cases from customers and we build brand new data pipelines. I have noticed that historically, if I involve my entire team (4-5 data engineers) early on in the design/prototyping, it turns into this &quot;too many chefs in the kitchen&quot; situation. The project would take forever to complete.
 This past weekend, I was recovering from a surgery, so I decided to &quot;hack&quot; this new project. I terraformed the infrastructure, and creating a workable prototype (limited functionality). I built this entire system in two days. It would have taken my team weeks/months, if they had started working on it from 0%.
 Now, I can delegate the 20% of the work (refactoring, optimzation, etc) to my team and just relax this upcoming quarter. Does anyone else do this type of &quot;runway&quot;, getting ahead of the team sprints?

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m wondering whether there&#x27;s JSON libraries can deserialize and point to input buffer(s) when deserializing? 
 Use case: I&#x27;m building a system where I get input data by communication channels, pass it to a deserializer function that writes data out to std::string_view. 
 When the callee function use JSON library which copies from the buffer, the std::string_view points to local memory that will be invalidated when it returns the parsed data. 
 I hope I made it clear enough, if not, please inquire.
 Regards,
 Hamza

 gcc, versions 11.1 through 14.1 all produce output that segfaults:
 terminate called after throwing an instance of &#x27;std::length_error&#x27; what(): basic_string::_M_create Program terminated with signal: SIGSEGV 
 clang &amp; msvc work fine.

                              <span>Pins 4 to 10 are outputs for a 7 segment display, pins 2 and 3 are interrupts. This is for an elevator. Pin 12 is HIGH when the lift is not in between floors, pin 2 and 3 indicate which floor the lift is on. Pin 2 and 3 should be both low when it is on the bottom floor. Basically, when the lift is on the bottom floor, pin 12 should be HIGH, pin 2 and 3 should be LOW. 
 int y &#x3D; 0;
 int z&#x3D;0;
 int k&#x3D;0;
 if (digitalRead(2) &#x3D;&#x3D; LOW) y &#x3D; 2;
 if (digitalRead(3) &#x3D;&#x3D; LOW) z &#x3D; 8;
 if (digitalRead(12)&#x3D;&#x3D;HIGH) k&#x3D;1;
 Serial.print(y);
 if ((y &#x3D;&#x3D; 2) &amp;&amp; (z &#x3D;&#x3D; 8) &amp;&amp; (k &#x3D;&#x3D; 1)) { //1 
 digitalWrite(4, LOW); //a 
 digitalWrite(5, LOW);// b
 digitalWrite(6, LOW); //c
 digitalWrite(7, LOW);//d
 digitalWrite(8, LOW);//e 
  digitalWrite(9, LOW);//f digitalWrite(10, LOW);//g 
 digitalWrite(5, HIGH);// b
 digitalWrite(6, HIGH); //c
  } 
 I&#x27;m talking about this if statement: if ((y &#x3D;&#x3D; 2) &amp;&amp; (z &#x3D;&#x3D; 8) &amp;&amp; (k &#x3D;&#x3D; 1)) { //1
 I want to display a &#x27;1&#x27; on a 7 segment display when an elevator is on the bottom floor. 
 This code is placed in void loop(). 
 The variable y, z, and k all have the correct values when they should, which means that the program should enter the if statement. 
 I don&#x27;t understand why the program doesn&#x27;t execute the code inside the if statement. 
 I have tried to write the digitalRead() functions inside the if parentheses but that won&#x27;t work.

 What are some good projects to refer to get better at GTK+ based GUI design?

 #define GLFW_INCLUDE_VULKAN #include  
 Had it said #define ANSWER 42 I would have understood what was happening. I&#x27;ve never seen a #define line without a right-hand side, so what is up? What does this syntax do and mean?

I also heard that there is another popular compiler called clang++ for cpp files. I&#x27;m having troubles deciding whether I should make the swap?

                              <span>I upgraded my macos to latest version and from then I am facing the below issue while compiling Rocksdb-5.8
 error: no matching constructor for initialization of &#x27;std::lock_guard&#x27; 
 Code in which error is occuring. Also lock_ is mutex type.
 size_t size() const { std::lock_guard lk(lock_); return buffer_.size(); } 
 MacOS version: 14.4.1
 Clang version: 15.0.0
 I tried downloading llvm@13 via brew and compiling but it didn&#x27;t work even though it used to compile with previous MacOS version so I want to know what might be the reason causing this I even tried changing -isysroot, setting LDFLAGS &amp; CPPFLAGS (which brew suggested).
 PS: I know RocksDB-5.8 is deprecated but its just what we are using at work. I also know the code fix for this(removing const) but I want to know why this error is occuring with os upgrade even after I tried with older version of Clang.

I know learncpp exists but i feel its overwhelming and a streamlined video course would work best. Please suggest some good courses that are preferably free...but I wouldnt mind spending some money.

                              <span>Hi.
 I&#x27;m a beginner in C++ programming.
 How could I test function (e.g. do_something()) in cpp?
 When I was using python or rust, I could use &#x60;python -m unittest ...&#x60; or &#x60;cargo test ...&#x60;.
 Is there anything similar to this approach?

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s question post and should be r/cpp_questions(https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp_questions/), but this is not a question with a fixed answer therefore I&#x27;m writing in here. Please tell me it is restricted.
  
I&#x27;m currently working for porting existing libraries like magic_enum, fastgltf and etc (which are used in my private module based projects). Changing dependencies with module is quite easy and giving me much benefits for compile time.
 During porting, I&#x27;m curious about which folder is the proper location for module port file (which ends with .cppm or .ixx extensions). At first I think src or module is the answer, because it is not header file and cannot be included. However, I realized that package managers like vcpkg does not install files in those folders, but compile the sources files to static/shared libraries (which ends with .a or .so extensions).
 Some module supporting libraries like Vulkan-Hpp and glm locates the module file in include directory. In this case, vcpkg install the header files to include directory and user can fetch them using ${glm_SOURCE_DIR}/include/glm/glm.cppm to declare module target.
 There are many package managing strategies that are preserving file structures, but I think CMake + vcpkg is the de facto system for C++ developers, so I&#x27;m confusing about the proper module exposing method. I want to get your opinions.

                              <span>I find it crazy how GCC (v14) has almost fully implemented the core language features of C++23 (except two features).
 The standard was finalized in Feb 2023. GCC has managed to do this in little over a year after the standard came out. This is brilliant and rarely happens with modern compilers.
 Thank you a ton to all the people who contributed to GCC and made all this possible.

 class ReadRequest{ public: ReadRequest(); template  ReadRequest setRegisterAddress(T address); ReadRequest setRegisterCount(int regCount); ~ReadRequest(); }; 
 The implementation details is omitted, which is valid and has no compile error.
 A test function
 //Edit: If a test Function is also a template function, the problem occurs. template  ReadRequest ReadValue(T startAddress, int regCount) { return ReadRequest().setRegisterCount(regCount).setRegisterAddress(startAddress); //return ReadRequest().setRegisterAddress(startAddress).setRegisterCount(regCount); } 
 In this test function, the first return statement is successfully highlighted and well-intellisensed with auto compeletion. But after changing the calling sequence of these two member function into the commented statement, visual studio intellisense can&#x27;t tell what member functions does &quot;ReadRequest().setRegisterAddress(startAddress)&quot; have.
 How does this mechanism work?

                              <span>Hello,
 Consider the following C++ union: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; struct Mystruct { char *p; // sizeof(p) &#x3D;&#x3D; 8, alignof(p) &#x3D;&#x3D; 8 uint32_t sz; // sizeof(sz) &#x3D;&#x3D; 4, alignof(sz) &#x3D;&#x3D; 4 }; // sizeof(MyStruct) &#x3D;&#x3D; 16 (with padding), // alignof(MyStruct) &#x3D;&#x3D; 8
 union U { MyStruct s; char buf[16]; }; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 My question is can I safely read the last element only of buf[] even when buf[] is not the last written to (active) member of the union? I believe that based on the way unions must work in any compiler implementation this element (buf[15]) can never be overwritten by any write to the MyStruct s. Is that correct?
 The primary objective is to be as space-efficient as possible while also working reliably.
 What I&#x27;m doing: This union is the sole data member for a string class (we&#x27;ll call it MyString). Within that string clas…</span>

A lot of it I know more or less. But should I have any specific paths completed in THM before I enroll in the PNPT cert? Or am I okay to jump right in? 
 I really just wanna make the step up to (what I consider) level 2 pentesting where it&#x27;s active directory environments and domain controllers. I&#x27;m just not sure if I&#x27;m ready or if I should spend time in other areas first. How would you go about it?

 But before I do any of it, I wanna know whats safer, I will be using my main PC to run the OS, but would it be safer to have it as a VM or a Dual Boot? 
 I will be reading the pinned thread after this, but I would also like to know if there&#x27;s any prerequisite software that I may need to install that could come in handy for added security or to make said activities more &#x27;efficient&#x27; or convenient

                              <span>If I’m hosting an application behind a NAT network and it only needs to communicate with a single endpoint can I create a NAT rule in the router by having the application behind the nat network send a TCP packet to a destination and I can listen at the destination for the source L3/4 headers to know where a tunnel is to my application?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m excited to introduce Chapar, a robust alternative to Postman that I&#x27;ve built using Golang and the Gio library. While still under development, Chapar already boasts a range of features designed to streamline your API testing workflow. You can install it from its source code, and I&#x27;m eager to share its capabilities with you.
 Key Features:
  
Organize with Workspaces: Create and manage workspaces to efficiently organize your API endpoints.
 Manage Environments: Store variables and configurations for your API endpoints with ease.
 Effortless Testing: Create and manage requests to thoroughly test your API endpoints.
 Versatile Request Sending: Send requests using various methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTION, CONNECT).
 Flexible Content Types: Send requests …</span>

 I have a Java background and have been writing golang on and off for about 2 years now but still can’t wrap my head around when to use channels… what are some design decisions on why you chose to use them when writing code?

                              <span>I have written my first blog post which states really simple features that makes Go more approachable, productive and performant than other languages. These features are just the things that I miss when I switch to other language. I would like to hear about what you all miss when you switch to other language and any and all constructive feedback are welcome.

It was surprising to see so many companies that I had applied to on that list (thank you all for the warnings), especially ones that we normally don’t hear about having bad reputations. 
 What is/was the worst company you’ve worked for?

 There&#x27;s a lot of data points for entry level, which seems to range anywhere from $65k-95k. But how about 5 YOE? 10 YOE? Etc.

                              <span>I dont know if “making our intern candidates spend hours of work on case study, reject them, dont give a reason even if they ask” is totally normal, but soon I am starting to send daily automated mails of “i want to know the reason why you wasted my lifespan, and this is my bajillionth mail”?
 seriously what the fuck is going on? I know HR s are huge dick with almost zero to none respect to the candidates, and they are getting fueled by the desperation I have, but, technical assignments too? Why everyone assessing the case studies I send rejects me with literally zero information? Why is everyone being such a dick right now? why? :(

                              <span>I have seen many posts arguing that quant is one of the highest paying software engineering positions. The averages online also seem decent.
 Thing is none of these numbers take living cost into account. Most quant jobs are in London and New York where the living cost is really high. So if you were to move there and do quant would you actually be earning more than someone doing software engineering somewhere relatively cheap to live in like Houston Texas?

                              <span>I still think the main reason of mass layoff​ is not really because of a overhiring, and those big tech companies are unable to handle it.
 I still think the main reason is section 174. If software salary and expenses of that are taxable as Research and Expenses, the more software worker and the higher salary of them will mean more tax to the company. That is why after the overhiring, the company needs to pay more taxes. Thus, overhiring is not even the main reason.

                              <span>Given the amount of attention Godot is getting within the games industry, what&#x27;s the most technically accomplished game that you can think of that uses the Godot engine?
 I think Human Diaspora is pretty accomplished, but it&#x27;s also a few years old now (May 2022). I am pretty sure that a number of other titles have come out since that raise the bar - especially considering how much more interest Godot has gotten in recent months after Unity started having problems.

 A year or so ago I began a Metroidavnia with a good friend of mine, he did all the programming as I am an artist and writer. We had a ton of fun working on it, got really good feedback on initial marketing and still would like to finish it one day. However the scope was too large, my friend and I both had day jobs at other studios and we were just too busy to finish at the time. &quot;Solo&quot; Failure 1.
 I took a break from development for a while and just did my job at the studio because the halt on that project broke my heart a bit. Then it was time for round two. I started working on an 2D ARPG b…</span>

 Can anyone point me in the direction of some tutorials for animating models this low in poly count? Any help greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I’m trying to learn as much as I can about how networking works in games at all of the various different scales of game.
 My question is this, when a more mainstream game needs to launch a multiplayer game mode, or expand its current number of servers, how do game studios tend to do that?
 Do they go out and purchase the hardware themselves and run the servers in their office?
 Is it cloud based these days? ie do they find a third party cloud server provider and just upload their game server code then point the clients at it - then presumably pay a fee for server rental?
 How does this differ for smaller scale games?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I&#x27;ve written a tool at the company I work at that basically allow you to autogenerate any boiler plate code based off a yaml file and a Jinja template schema. At work, we use to tool to autogenerate C++ classes that have built in serialize/deserialize functionality for all kinds of different message classes that we work with. I&#x27;ve also written templates that can autogenerate Protobuf converters that convert a C++ message object to its protobuf equivalent. This has been super handy for us because we work with many different C++ message classes and hand typing all the converters would be tedious and error prone. 
 My question is: I am debating making this tool open source, but want to see if other people who write C++ encounter similar problems to this and if a tool like this would be valuable and helpful before I spent a bunch of time re-working it and making it available on GitHub. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,So I&#x27;m displaying some simple text information, and I was wondering if someone can tell me a better way to do this to be more accurate depending on the changing text. The Log function essentially does this:
 std::cout &lt;&lt; std::format(&quot;{}\t\t{}\n&quot;, LogTypeToString(type), vformat(fmt, args));
 The displaying of the text:
 constexpr auto renderTextSize &#x3D; sizeof(renderer); Log(LogType::Info, &quot;{:*^{}} OpenGL Information {:*^{}}&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 16 + renderTextSize, &quot;&quot;, 16 + renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, &quot;* Version : {} ({}.{}) {:{}} *&quot;, version, glVersion[0], glVersion[1], &quot;&quot;, 26 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, &quot;* Vendor : {:{}} *&quot;, vendor, 52 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, &quot;* Renderer : {:{}} *&quot;, renderer, renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, &quot;* GLSL Version : {:{}} *&quot;, glslVersion, 52 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, &quot;{:*^{}}&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 76 - renderTextSize); 
 As you may see, since the renderer text seems to be the longest by nature I&#x27;m trying to use that as the complete width so that this box shape using &quot;*&quot; is always just a space ahead and everything else meets it. I got it to look good with my settings, but I&#x27;m wondering how it would look if my information was different. Something tells me it wouldn&#x27;t make a nice box.
  
[Info] ************************* OpenGL Information **************
 [Info] * Version : 4.6.0 NVIDIA 552.22 (4.6)
 [Info] * Vendor : NVIDIA Corporation
 [Info] * Renderer : NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Laptop GPU/PCIe/SSE2 * [Info] * GLSL Version : 4.60 NVIDIA [Info] **********************************************************
  
EDIT: It&#x27;s hard to get it to display here, but basically the first line makes as many &quot;*&quot; to the length of the Renderer: text. So that it would complete the so-called &quot;box.&quot;
 That&#x27;s how it displays in the console. Currently, everything is designed with my own hardware information in mind, but I&#x27;d like to make it dynamic.Thanks, and have a great day.

 I successfully printed out अ to cout on the terminal but when I open up output.txt there&#x27;s some garbage character which I believe is the End-Of-Inquiry character (ASCII value 5). How can I make this print properly to output.txt?

                              <span>For context: I am an electronics engineer by education and practice, but I switched to full time software development in 2016.
 By far, C and C++ has been most of my career. Dangerous languages perhaps, but languages that know they are dangerous, and document exactly where the sharp edges are located.
 However, for about a year and a half, I&#x27;ve been branching out and it appears to me that every single language and technology I look at has behaviors that are not defined. They just don&#x27;t admit to it.
 I opened an issue in docker&#x27;s documentation because they were missing an explanation for a behavior. Closed as resolved with, paraphrased, &quot;read the repository if you want to know how docker works.&quot;
 By that standard, C++ doesn&#x27;t have undefined behavior either! Just read your compiler&#x27;s source code and you&#x27;ll know what happens.
 Same problem with Microsoft&#x27;s Azure cloud services. Many guides and tutorials but no authoritative source that explains how Azure works, what each option does, and how they interact - or if there is, it&#x27;s sufficiently burrowed that I&#x27;ve been unable to find it after searching for a while, and their representatives cannot guide me to it either. Dotnet projects? Same issue again, there&#x27;s any number of properties you can set for your project and you just have to guess from their name what they will do - and don&#x27;t get me started on the difficulty of writing provably correct golang.
  
I can sign for the correctness of C/C++ software. I might be wrong because mistakes happen, but those are mistakes, not lies.
 I cannot sign off on most other software. If I claim that I know something is correct, I am lying. I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m guessing. &quot;It worked so far.&quot;
  
I can write software in all these languages, use all these other technologies. I cannot do engineering with them. I wish I could.

                              <span>What I mean is that is there a common thread to unit testing everywhere you go? Like can senior engineers expect to quickly be able to switch jobs and pick it up very quickly, or is it very uniquely defined for each company. I&#x27;d like to learn about it but for my somewhat trivial hobby projects I can&#x27;t figure out a use case.

                              <span>To be clear, I am aware that the code is already valid C++. I am able to run it without any issues, though I do get a warning from the compiler that the functionparam_sub_scalar is unused.
 The code is a relatively simple script that fits a quadratic to a few datapoints using gradient descent with an Adam optimizer. I am aware that there are easier ways of doing this, such as with least squares.
 The last few months, I&#x27;ve been working in embedded systems in C, but most of my programming experience is in data science with Rust and Python. This script was just something I wrote to have a bit of fun making C behave more like an OOP language with a task I&#x27;m more familiar with.
 I&#x27;ve since rewritten the script in Zig, but I also wanted to try rewriting it with C++. I&#x27;d also like to stick to exclusively using stuff from the standard library, if possible.
 Since I don&#x27;t have much experience with C++, are there any specific features I should try to advantage of here?
 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated
 (for those curious, the data should reflect y &#x3D; x^2 - 2*x + 1)
 Here is the C code:

                              <span>I am learning about generating mazes but I can’t seem to make the Start-point “S” and End-point “E” to print diagonally, i.e at the very corner of the maze … However when I generat maze S and E are printing in the middle of the maze instead of the very corners of it …
 Can anyone help me adjust the code to print the Start-point “S” and End point “E” at the very corners of the maze? I provided an image of what I mean by “Very corners of the maze” Thank you very much.

                              <span>I will try and give all infos as accurate and fast as possible:
  
Newly installed msys2 and sfml (using pacman of msys2) on C drive. (Edit: I am using VS Code, new installation)
 Created project on drive D (I know, but I dont have that much space on my drives)
 Checked functionality of the setup with basic hello_world.cpp -&gt; WORKS
 Checked functionality of the SFML part of the setup with code from this https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-linux.php -&gt; DOES NOT WORK (compiling without errors, but nothing happens when executed, no window created, nothing)
  
Compile command:
 g++ src/main.cpp -o bin/a -I C:/msys64/mingw64/include -L C:/msys64/mingw64/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-system -lsfml-Window 
 So, I added:
 std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;test&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; 
 BUT STILL: no output in the console, no window created by sfml, no errors while compiling or executing
 Thank you for any help I can get

However, I also need to use MeCab as a library in this app, and it does not use CMake.
 I know that CMake can also work with non-CMake libraries, but I&#x27;m not good enough with it to figure out how to implement this correctly.
 So far I have this CMakeLists file: https://pastebin.com/SJQcz5Eq
 MeCab compile instructions look like this: https://imgur.com/a/i7TTY9C
 What should I add to CMakeLists to make it work?

 I&#x27;m a novice when it comes to C++ and CMake. I created a small project using the libigl library, and used their sample project as a starting point, replacing the main.cpp with my own .cpp file and uncommenting the libigl modules I used in the CMakeLists.txt.
 Now I also want to add fTetWild to my project and use it via function wrapper. That wiki doesn&#x27;t explain how to do so, but I&#x27;m assuming it works just like outlined in the slightly older TetWild project.
 So, what I did is:
  
In my project folder, create an fTetWild folder and put the full fTetWild project in there
 
In fTetWild, create a build folder, go to the build folder and do cmake .. and make. This does a bunch of stuff, some of which is crea…</span>

                              <span>Hey folks, I am trying to implement a lock free map for a real time safe project but this seems to be may more difficult than I thought it would be. I am just tempted to use spinlock since I am not allowed to use mutex/locks etc. I still gave the lockfree map a try. In my implementation, I am getting a snapshot of the current map, updating with a value, then compare swapping. I am sure it has a lot of mistakes and redundant copies of the whole thing. Please advise on the best way to do this.
 struct ThreadSafeMap { private: using MapType &#x3D; std::unordered_map&gt;; std::atomic _map; public: ThreadSafeMap(): _map{new MapType{}} { } ~ThreadSafeMap() { delete _map.load(); } void set(const std::string&amp; key, const std::string&amp; value) { MapType* expected &#x3D; nullptr; MapType* map_snapshot &#x3D; nullptr; do { if (map_snapshot) { // Cleanup from unsuccessful atomic update, outdated. delete map_snapshot; } // Get a snapshot expected &#x3D; _map.load(); map_snapshot &#x3D; new MapType{*expected}; auto it &#x3D; map_snapshot-&gt;find(key); if (it !&#x3D; map_snapshot-&gt;end()) { // found, update. it-&gt;second.push_back(value); } else { // not found, add. it &#x3D; map_snapshot-&gt;insert({key, {value}}).first; } } while(!_map.compare_exchange_strong(expected, map_snapshot)); if (expected) { // Successful atomic update. delete expected; } } std::optional&gt; get(const std::string&amp; key) { // Get a snapshot MapType* expected &#x3D; _map.load(); // Set might have already deleted this pointer.

 template vector( InputIt first, InputIt last, const Allocator&amp; alloc &#x3D; Allocator() ); 
 If the range I&#x27;m copying from returns a sentinel type for its .end(), which is different from the iterator type returned by my .begin(), then I can&#x27;t use this constructor? My only other option is to move my range in using a for-loop?

 This works fine by providing a constructor in the promise_typelike below (Godbolt): 
 struct S; class Wrapper { public: class promise_type { S *_s; public: promise_type(S &amp;s) { _s &#x3D; &amp;s; std::cout : In member function &#x27;Wrapper T::sub()&#x27;: :41:5: error: no matching function for call to &#x27;Wrapper::promise_type::promise_type()&#x27; 41 | } | ^ :14:9: note: candidate: &#x27;Wrapper::promise_type::promise_type(S&amp;)&#x27; 14 | promise_type(S &amp;s) | ^~~~~~~~~~~~ :14:9: note: candidate expects 1 argument, 0 provided :11:11: note: candidate: &#x27;constexpr Wrapper::promise_type::promise_type(const Wrapper::promise_type&amp;)&#x27; 11 | class promise_type { | ^~~~~~~~~~~~ :11:11: note: candidate expects 1 argument, 0 provided :11:11: note: candidate: &#x27;constexpr Wrapper::promise_type::promise_type(Wrapper::promise_type&amp;&amp;)&#x27; :11:11: note: candidate expects 1 argument, 0 provided Compiler returned: 1 
 This can be fixed with concepts (Godbolt):
 template  concept IsDerivedFromBaseRef &#x3D; std::is_base_of_v&gt;; ... template  promise_type(Derive&amp; derived) requires IsDerivedFromBaseRef { _s &#x3D; &amp;derived; std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Derived Ref &quot; &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;; } 
 Does anyone know why this is? And is my fix using concepts robust? 
 Cheers
 Edit: 
 This seems to be a GCC bug. On Clang Trunk it works. On GCC Trunk, you get a internal compiler error that has already been reported

 To make it short, you can scroll over to the getEntryTime() function. Everything worked but in here it requires me to pass a Student class a a parameter to the lambda function:

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve built this lock-free single produce multiple consumer queue. The queue works fine on x86 (amd &amp; intel procs), but seems to choke on aarch64. For both architectures I am using gcc 13.2 with ( -mcpu&#x3D;neoverse-v1) specified for aarch64. I have run with both -O2 and -O3 and see the issue repo with both. The issue that I am seeing is that occasionally when multiple consumers concurrently consume from the queue two consumers end up with the same &#x27;item&#x27; value even with a different tail value. For example, given 3 threads T1, T2, T2; if T1 is the producer and stores a value A at index 1 (head &#x3D;&#x3D; 1), and B at index 2 (head &#x3D;&#x3D; 2). Concurrently T2 and T3 are dequeuing, T2 gets A (tail &#x3D;&#x3D; 1) and T3 sees tail &#x3D;&#x3D; 2, but still gets the value A (not B). So even though T3 has the proper tail value i…</span>

                              <span>Just looking for discussion. Mainly curious about how y&#x27;all feel about Boost and its kin. I&#x27;m sure most folks here have experience having to deal with emulating a feature from a future C++ standard, or some other task that might fit in the STL. What&#x27;s given you the least headaches? Does Boost remain king to y&#x27;all?

                              <span>I started with a basic tutorial about 3 days ago. I&#x27;ve since been using the docs, and have just been banging out little programs to get the feel for it. It&#x27;s like C with batteries, but easier. That being said I don&#x27;t know it yet so I&#x27;m sure it will get very complex. I welcome that. I have been also using AI as a consultant or a tutor, (I enjoy programming , I&#x27;m not using AI to generate code. You can&#x27;t learn it that way anyway, and learning it is my main objective) and let me say that is also an amazing tool. Anytime I am unsure about something I just ask the AI and it clears it up. What a great time to learn a new language. I&#x27;ve been having some trouble grasping interfaces, but it&#x27;s not like I must understand them right now. I&#x27;m not a newbie. C was my first language, then Python, C#, a bit of Java, bash, batch, and I used Visual Basic a long time ago, but I usually don&#x27;t mention that. I welcome any tips you guys may have that could help me understand it even better. I primarily intend to use it for CLI, and web applications. It really impressed me that I was able to take the basic &quot;Go web examples&quot; , and build a small CRUD app with password hasing, templates and database access, just by breaking down the examples. It just works, lol.

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to Golang, and trying to build an app that uses 3rd party APIs on behalf of the user. I&#x27;ve seen in the documentation that you should always reuse the clients in order to take advantage of existing HTTP connections. At first, that looks pretty straight forward: initiate a new client at start time, attach it to the server struct and access the client from anywhere, like a singleton.
 Now, say I have a Gitlab client that sends requests on behalf of an user which has provided an access token. I cannot initiate the client at start time and reuse it (setting the token before calling the api) because I could have race conditions where an user ends up with the token from someone else, so sharing an authenticated client seems like a no go. 
 I think I could create a client per http request, making it unique per client, but then if I only make one call to gitlab per request it&#x27;s the same thing as never reusing the client.
 Do I make sense? How should I go for such use cases?

 In below code why type of v and s[k] are different. They should be same, right?
 Go playground
 package main import ( &quot;fmt&quot; &quot;reflect&quot; ) func main() { s :&#x3D; &quot;PAYPALISHIRING&quot; for k, v :&#x3D; range s { fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(v), reflect.TypeOf(s[k])) break } } 
 result:

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working with Godot for about 3 years now. Over that time I have often found myself on https://godotshaders.com/shader/ looking through their catalogue. I must say, it&#x27;s sadly not very populated.
 I&#x27;m not sure why as the UI and site layout is perfect for it&#x27;s role, I&#x27;d really love to see it used more.
 Are people aware of this site? If so are you willing to donate shader code to it?
 I&#x27;ve seen 20-30 posts sharing shader code over the past 2 days and I feel it rather sad that that code will practically vanish once the posts are thrown to the bottom of the reddit post stack. A lot of them just don&#x27;t get enough attention to show up in search result so for all intents and purposes they&#x27;re gone.
 I&#x27;d like to urge players to post their shaders on the site - it really is a great archive and I feel it would add a lot more permanency to your contribution. As it stands, posting it to reddit you&#x27;re limiting yourself (and others) to around a 48 hour window before the post becomes practically invisible to the general public.

                              <span>Introduced some huge aesthetic changes, and added functionality to transition between environmental states. Also added some music, and the player can now go from level to level. 
 I would like some feedback, though: one of the changes I made was that the level now features flickering lights, and my concern is that they might bother some people. I would love to hear some opinions on this. I like the effect but obviously I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable while playing. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi r/godot,
 I&#x27;ve been working on a project called GodotInGameBuildingSystem, aimed at helping developers easily integrate building mechanics into their Godot games. It’s straightforward, open-source, and I hope it can be useful to some of you!
 Features:
  
Dynamic Building: Add robust building functions that allow players to construct and customize their environments.
 Customizable: Adjust it to suit your game’s unique style and needs.
 Written in C#: Currently available in C#, ensuring robust performance and integration.
 Open Source: Free to use and modify under the MIT License—contributions are welcome!
  
Why consider it?
 It’s built specifically for Godot, making integration smooth, and it’s a great way to add interactive elements to your game. I’d love for you to try it out and share any feedback or suggestions!
 Future Plans:
 I am planning to develop a version in GDScript based on community interest. The sooner I see significant interest, the faster I&#x27;ll work on releasing the GDScript version!
 👉 See it on Asset Store
 Thanks for checking it out, and happy developing!

                              <span>With recent breakthroughs being made on the N64 scene such as Ship of Harkinian for Ocarina of Time and the now released Zelda64Recomp project for Majora&#x27;s Mask, discussion has opened up regarding the difficulties of emulating N64 throughout the years and alternative solutions moving forward. While previous projects have brought many games to a playable state over the years, many audio and visual effects end up getting lost lost in translation. With these recops projects, were now able to get fully intact ports of these games in all their glory with plenty of enhancements as well.
  
Zelda64 Recomp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ywWwUuWRgsM
  
With there now being a healthy interest for N64 from both fans and developers regarding these recent projects, it got me thinking about other consoles such as the OG Xbox and Sega Saturn that also have a troubled history with emulation progress over the years. How cool would it be to have decomp/recomp projects for games like Jet Set Radio Future and Panzer Dragoon Orta?
 For those of you with experience working on such consoles, how feasible do you see this? Is this something that has piqued the interest of anyone in these communities?
 Looking forward to hear what you guys have to say. Recompilation looks to be a much more accessible alternative to the undertaking that a full decomp entails.

 But I can&#x27;t get it out my head and need new ideas lol. I don&#x27;t feel any attachment to random word generators, and I thought &quot;oh I&#x27;d use that old nickname&quot; but then realised in the tiny chance someone in the future googled it, there&#x27;s a chance they&#x27;d find my ye olde cringy wattpad fanfiction. and dear god no.

                              <span>Some of my group project members keep trying to add funny gags &quot;because that make the game more fun&quot;
 Even though that goes against the design we set out to make, we designed for a serious tone. 
 Clearly they&#x27;re not capable to work on something with a serious tone but how do i work with that or stop them somewhat?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently developing a prison-escape game, basically very similar to &quot;The Escapists&quot; but in a low-poly 3D setting. The steam shop page exists for a few months, not resulting in many wishlists, which I would expect for a hobby project without marketing (except for a few YouTube shorts (~100-400 views each)).
 So the daily wishlists were around 0-1, mostly 0. Then, a few days ago, I checked the tags again, and compared them to the tags to &quot;The Escapists&quot;, since the gameplay is pretty similar.
 Here is my little/big fuck-up: The tag I initially set with the highest priority is (in german) &quot;Ausbruchssimulation&quot;, which can also be understood as a game where you/the player has to break out of somewhere. I was kinda wondering why &quot;The Escapists&quot; is not tagged with the same tag, as I would imagine it is the most fitting for this kind of game.
 I looked at the games that were tagged with &quot;Ausbruchssimulation&quot;, saw stuff like Pague Inc. etc., and had an epiphany: changed the language to english, &quot;Ausbruchssimulation&quot; is the translation for &quot;Outbreak Sim&quot;.
 Yeah, so i removed the tag and (at least for the four days since) this also had an impact on daily wishlists: https://ibb.co/GHgBXxh

                              <span>Nine months ago, with my only experience being far too many hours spent watching devlog videos on Youtube, I started my first game project. An estimated 600 hours later, the Steam release is just over a week away. 
 It&#x27;s a very basic game, but I learnt a huge amount making it and so wanted to share some takeaways and reflections:
  
 Art…
 I chose pixel art because I thought it would be easier than the other art styles. I no longer think this. The idea that “there are only so many ways you can arrange 32x32 pixels” was very naïve. I did however find that this limitation forced me to be creative in a way that didn’t sacrifice consistency, and consistency seemed to be worth a lot more than assets that were individually ‘good’.
 One of the biggest jumps forwards in the art was sticking to a c…</span>

The ls in the ll integer suffix must have the same case, so u, ul, lu, ull, llu, U, Ul, lU, Ull, llU, uL, Lu, uLL, LLu, UL, LU, ULL and LLU are all valid but Ll, lL, and uLl are not.
 You use octal way more than you think: 0 is an octal constant.
 strtod need not exactly match the compilation-time float syntax conversion.
 The punctuators (sic) : EDOM (domain error, for math errors), EILSEQ (&quot;illegal sequence&quot;; encoding error for wchar stuff), and ERANGE (range error).
 You can use universal character names in identifiers. int \u20a3 &#x3D; 0; is perfectly valid C.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to programming, I want to code in C running my code with the Code Runner extension. I have MinGW installed with the proper packages. When I run the code it runs successfully in the Output, but i want to work with inputs so I want my code to run in the terminal. I ticked the run in terminal setting in the extension&#x27;s setting but when now I go and run it this error shows up in the terminal:
 cd &quot;C:\Users\MTB35F~1\AppData\Local\Temp\&quot; ; if ($?) { gcc tempCodeRunnerFile.c -o tempCodeRunnerFile } ; if ($?) { .\tempCodeRunnerFile }
 cd : An object at the specified path C:\Users\MTB35F~1 does not exist.

 This whole thing works on my laptop, but not on my desktop computer, and I have no clue why. Also I don&#x27;t recognize the &quot;MTB35F~1&quot; user. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Does the standard require that pointer-to-array types should have the same representation as their corresponding pointer-to-element types?
 For example, is it always guaranteed that the pointer types int (*)[], int (*)[][1], int (*)[][1][1] (and so on) will have the same representation as int *?
 Use case: Mostly an artificial scenario, but this legitimizes passing pointer-to-element (without conversion) to a function expecting pointer-to-array (or vice-versa).
 void foo(int *, ...); void bar(int (*)[], ...); void baz(int (*)[][1], ...); void test(void) { enum {nrows &#x3D; 2, ncols &#x3D; 3}; int arr[nrows][ncols] &#x3D; {0}; void (*fn)(int *, ...); fn &#x3D; foo; fn(*arr, nrows, ncols); fn &#x3D; (typeof (fn))bar; fn(*arr, nrows, ncols); fn &#x3D; (typeof (fn))baz; fn(*arr, nrows, ncols); }

 I am building a Satellite (ST) to Ground Stations (GS) distributed communication system, and I am at the point where I am implementing leader election among satellites and async undirected graph based leader election for the ground stations. The election processes do indeed finish, upon which point the coordinator process (rank n-1) sends out the ST leader to all GS processes and the GS leader to all ST processes respectively.
 Everything works fine for the ST election and message passing, but for some reason, when the coordinator sends out the GS_ELECT event to all ST processes after the GS leader election, the ST processes do not receive the event. I tried logging the probe&#x27;s tag, and it is just always START_LELECT_ST and no matter what event is sent afterward, it just never changes the status of the probe, neither with GS_LEADER nor with TERMINATE.
 The relevant ST receiving part is on line 200 of the pastebin source code. I am busting my head trying to figure out why this is happening since if I am not mistaken, MPI_Probe and MPI_Iprobe should be seeing the pending new events and grabbing their tags.
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

 This is a proof of concept on iterators in c. This is the whole file if you want to look yourself. It compiles only on the latest version of clang and most newer versions of gcc.

 I have a scenario with three separate struct definitions that contain their own data that will be sent to separate threads. However, two of the structs need to be able to read some information about a 3rd struct periodically in their own threads.
 I have mocked up a scenario (without involving thread boilerplate) that might help me generally understand the necessary semantics of shared memory across structs.
 #include  #include  struct struct_one { struct struct_three *s3; }; struct struct_two { int some_data; struct struct_three *s3; }; struct struct_three { int some_more_data; }; int main(void) { // heap allocate my first struct struct struct_one *struct1; struct1 &#x3D; malloc(sizeof(struct struct_one)); // heap allocate my second struct struct struct_two *struct2;…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a DSP plugin - an Apple AudioUnit - audio effetcs for applications like Garage Band or Logic - with the DSP code written in Rust, the glue-code in Objective C and C++, and the UI in Swift using SwiftUI.
 It turns out, SwiftUI is really too heavyweight for this purpose - you wouldn&#x27;t think it would be, but when the machine is processing many tracks of real-time audio, it is - things like popups needing to allocate a new native window and some of the magic it implements under the hood is pretty expensive - and the UI is non-trivial - think rendering multiple mathematical curves that do not decompose trivially into Bezier curves over an adjustable window of frequency bands while overlaying the amplitudes in those frequency bands and having the whole thing be responsive, in real time.…</span>

I obviously want to and have to keep it legal so I was wondering if you know any websites that let me legally showcase some SQL hacking action. Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all, after a bit of research, I believe I have a dormakaba 10620 key fob for my apartment that I would like to have cloned. My apartment does not issue spare keys and I would like one for my girlfriend.
 I’m pretty sure it’s 13.52 mhz mifare, but there appears to be 3 different models, 1k, 2k, and 4K - Im not sure which one. There is zero identifying details on my fob, no text or markings. Please see the attached pictures.
 After looking into a bit it, it appears the promark3 or a service such as “clone my key” / a key duplicating kiosk could work.
 What would be the simplest / not super expensive path forward?

                              <span>Hey guys, I’m a devops engineer with 1 year experience. This is my first actual job and I went straight into devops because my interests align here. I am stuck in my current job because there is nothing more to do. I have revamped the entire infrastructure of my (medium sized - multi million) company, terraforming the infrastructure, managing and improving deployments, improved kubernetes, docker images, pipelines, etc…
 Now my company hired 3 new devops engineers for a different company because they are cheaper but s the tasks go to them. Because of that I had a lot of free time, but I’m actually losing motivation for devops. Automating used to be my passion but now I’m in a bit of a rut
 Due to certain personal circumstances I can’t leave the job at current moment; although I thought about it because I’m kinda reaching the ceiling of this company.
 If anyone has any advice, I would appreciate it

                              <span>To any engineering managers here, when you start a new engineering manager role, what are the steps you take in your first week, 2 weeks, month to give yourself the best chance?
 I&#x27;m an engineering manager in a company I&#x27;ve held multiple roles in for the past 8 years.
 I&#x27;m ok at my job because I know the systems, the people and all the skeletons hidden about.
 When I eventually move to a new company where I don&#x27;t know the people or systems, I&#x27;m unsure how to set myself up for success.

 Work for an agency so I generally do client work. I&#x27;ve been with my current client for an unusually long time (years) which is my longest term engagement and they&#x27;re very happy with me. It&#x27;s a non-tech company in a lucrative industry.
 The work is generally easy but I am the only developer in the organization. As such, the work I do is often glueing their SaaS products together in some way or building small internal tools for my stakeholders. Don&#x27;t really exercise my dev muscles often and the easiest (least complicated) solution is often the best one for their needs.
 The pay is great and generally the WLB is comfortable, but I don&#x27;t work with any other devs and really feel my skills deprecating over time. The pay is at the top-end of what my expected range would be like so it&#x27;s difficult to make a change without taking a pay cut. I worry that whenever this engagement ends (they always do), I will be a much worse dev than I was prior to working here. However, it&#x27;s hard to not make hay while the sun is shining, so to speak, and just collect the easy money while it&#x27;s here.
 What would you do?

                              <span>So we have a fairly new CTO thats pushing for various different process changes in dev teams. 
 Two of these is trunk based development and full time pair programming to enable CI/CD. 
 For context my team looks after a critical area of our platforms (the type where if we screw up serious money can be lost and we&#x27;ll have regulators to answer to). We commit to repos that are contributed to by multiple teams and basically use a simplified version of Gitflow with feature branches merging into master only when fully reviewed &amp; tested and considered prod ready. Once merged to master the change is released to prod. 
 From time to time we do pair programming but tend to only do it when it&#x27;s crunch time where necessary. The new process basically wants this full time. Devs have trialed this and feel burned out doing the pair programming all day everyday. 
 Basically I ran my team on the idea of trunk based development and they&#x27;re heavily against it including the senior devs (one of whom called it &#x27;madness&#x27;). 
 The main issue from their perspective is they consider it risky and few others don&#x27;t think it will actually improve anything. I&#x27;m not entirely clued up on where manual QA testing fits into the process either but what I&#x27;ve read suggests this takes place after merge to master &amp; even release which is a big concern for the team. Devs know that manual QA&#x27;s capture important bugs via non-happy paths despite having a lot of automated tests and 100% code coverage. We already use feature flags for our projects so that we only expose this to clients when ready but devs know this isn&#x27;t full proof.
 We&#x27;ve spoken about perhaps trialing this with older non-critical apps (which didn&#x27;t get much buy in) and changes are rarely needed on these apps so I don&#x27;t see us actually being able to do this any time soon whereas the CTO (and leadership below) is very keen for all teams to take this all on by this summer.

                              <span>I gathered this data from the two most comprehensive sources out there: TrueUp.io and Layoffs.fyi.
 Here&#x27;s a quick summary of the findings below:
  
There are 29.5% more tech job openings today than the low hit last March, and this positive trend has been largely steady
 The YoY number of average daily tech layoffs has declined by roughly 20%
  
Notes on the stats below: the difference in total numbers is due to TrueUp&#x27;s much larger dataset (it tracks more startups &amp; non-US markets). Both still show a nice improvement --- the decline in average daily layoffs is around 24% on TrueUp and 14% on Layoffs.fyi. Also, I rounded the figures to the nearest 1K.
 TrueUp.io
  
There are 211K open tech jobs today; there were 163K at the March 3, 2023 low. That said, the peak was 478K in April &#x27;22
 In 2023, there were 429K people laid off by 2,001 tech companies (an average of 1,175 people/day)
 So far in 2014, there have been 118K people laid off by 540 tech companies (an average of 891 people/day)
  
Layoffs.fyi
  
In 2023, there were 263K people laid off by 1,191 tech companies (an average of 721 people/day)
 So far in 2014, there have been 81K people laid off by 287 tech companies (an average of 619 people/day)
  
If it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s improving, hang in there. No market moves in a straight line...but at least the bumpy ride appears to be on the right track!

                              <span>Hi.
 I&#x27;m looking at the following scenario: A (enterprise) team went the microservices route. Unfortunately there is zero data locality, everything is layered horizontally (persistence service, entity A logic service, entity B logic service, etc) and everything depends on everything else. Services keep each in other sync via synchronous RPC over network. In short, it&#x27;s a distributed monolith.
 The project has progressed too far to make major architecture changes, and we need to move fast.
 We will soon have the foreseeable issue that keeping state synchronized across multiple distributed services and databases is hard. I shudder to think how the current system would behave during outages, and the many inconsistent states it will get in. I fear that if we don&#x27;t intervene now, it will turn into a maintenance nightmare on release.
 If you&#x27;ve been in a similar situation, which eventual consistency pattern did you go with, and what was your experience? My main concern is keeping implementation overhead as low as possible. I&#x27;ve thought about the usual at-least-once event-driven + idempotency route, but I&#x27;m worried about the overhead during day-to-day development, and amount of changes required to even get started with that. Maybe try 2 phase commits instead?
 If you&#x27;ve been in a similar situation of trying to work with a distributed monolith, I&#x27;d be curious to hear what you went with, and what your experience was.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed a pattern in my career:
  
At first everything is great. Honeymoon period.
 Then several hardships happened. But since I am still following the team&#x27;s mission, no problemo.
 Then random reorgs happened. I wasn&#x27;t impacted so no big deal.
 Then random projects unrelated to the (what I thought to be the main) mission appeared. I start getting confused.
 Then productivity dipped.
 Burnt out.
  
Of course the answer is always to look for a new job. But how can I get better at the timing? Preferably, how can I move on before reaching burnt out? How can I ride the waves better when various random unrelated projects appeared (after all, we are all just a pawn in the cog regardless how many ownerships I shown)?
 Edit: 25 YoE functioning as architect at various large companies. Spearheaded many successful large projects as well as failed projects.

 I&#x27;ve seen some high functioning garbage. VB6 written by interns full of gotos and inline sql manipulating data on the most de-normalized database with the most nonsense column names. Businesses built on a mountain of that intractable spaghetti, moving millions and millions of your dollars every day. ML javascript written by biotech post-docs doing god-knows-what processing your DNA data. Reactive message / trigger systems so complex you couldn&#x27;t graph the whole thing it if you tried.
 I won&#x27;t pretend I&#x27;ve seen it all but I&#x27;m realizing what I&#x27;m willing to tolerate is lessening as I get older. That or the environments I&#x27;m in just suck?

                              <span>For example, I downloaded Visual Studio with the intent to set it up for programming strictly in C. However, I never see any mention of C when choosing templates or other options. C++ is all over the place, but it doesn&#x27;t seem obvious to a newer programmer that C is a common language that merits its own setup, tutorials, and template options in IDEs such as VS.
 Why wouldn&#x27;t C be more... obvious? Why the assumptions that a C++ environment is suitable for someone wanting to program in C?
 Appreciate any thoughts from the community on the matter.

                              <span>Hey so I&#x27;m now learning C as a second language after python and I&#x27;m currently practicing through codeacademy only. What do you think I should do after I finished their programme?
 PSA: I&#x27;m learning C for my class in 2nd year of college for algorithms and data structures and I find my course material in college not very understandable so I&#x27;m trying to find some sources to exercise, learn and test my knowledge.

                              <span>Hello, I try to calc a checksum sumatory 4096 of two byte but I can&#x27;t solve.
 I have two data line of example:
 B6 61 87 C0 83 80 9C 80 A1 80 80 80 80 80 89 89 89 89 80 80 80 80 B3 81 80 C0 FE 81 80 80 8D 83 80 80 C2 82 87 D8 80 C9 80 E0 80 C5 80 D1 80 80 B7 84 82 80 FF 82 &quot;E5 9E&quot;
 and
 B6 61 83 C0 80 C0 9C 80 A1 80 80 80 80 80 89 89 89 89 80 80 80 80 B3 81 80 C0 FE 81 80 80 8D 83 80 80 C2 82 86 D8 80 C9 80 E0 80 C5 80 D1 80 80 B7 84 82 80 FF 82 &quot;9D 9F&quot;
 The checksum sumatory is the two last byte.
 I saw in the manual that the kind of checksum is 4096.
 I try to calculate the checksum 256 with this web but only coincide the first byte and not always.

 I want to run this on both mac and windows.
 Although I have found a solution for windows using Icon.ExtractAssociatedIcon().
 I want a solution for mac or one that can be used on all platforms.

                              <span>Hey all. So, as a challenge to myself to actually start doing projects in C, I decided to make a ncurses-based implementation of Conway&#x27;s Game of Life. Part of the logic involves storing the current state in one matrix, and using that to build a second matrix for the next generation&#x27;s state. Each cycle, the &#x27;next state&#x27; (we&#x27;ll call it m2) becomes the &#x27;previous state&#x27; (m1), and my first implementation simply involved looping through the matrices and overwriting each cell of m1 with the corresponding cell of m2. While this works fine, I wanted to do it more &quot;optimally&quot; by simply swapping two pointer addresses. This is the function that I came up with:
 void swap_ptr(int (**p1)[ROWS][COLS], int (**p2)[ROWS][COLS]) { int (*tmp)[ROWS][COLS] &#x3D; *p1; *p1 &#x3D; *p2; *p2 &#x3D; tmp; return; } 
 The implementation looks like this:
 int matrix1[ROWS][COLS]; int matrix2[ROWS][COLS]; int (*m1)[ROWS][COLS] &#x3D; &amp;matrix1; int (*m2)[ROWS][COLS] &#x3D; &amp;matrix2; /* main loop starts, insert Life logic here to populate m2 based on the contents of m1*/ display(*m2); swap_ptr(&amp;m1, &amp;m2); 
 This appears to be working fine, but it&#x27;s not at all like the methods I found online for the same thing, which instead called for something more like:
 void swap_ptr(int ***p1, int ***p2); 
 Is there something wrong with the way I&#x27;m doing it, or is this just one of those funny C things where there&#x27;s multiple &quot;correct&quot; ways to do something? Thanks in advance!
 EDIT: fixed typos in my code examples.

                              <span>I have some code which uses Automake for build and googletest for testing.
 Googletest no longer supports use of Autotools and it looks to me as if it will be simpler to rewrite my unit tests than to stop using Autotools.
 What options are there for an Autotools-friendly testing framework for C++?

                              <span>For example, like the title says, if I&#x27;m given a bunch of employee unique ID and a number (hours of work) associated which each one of them. How would you solve this?
 I know that std::vector or std::array is pretty standard (storing a string and an integer) and putting them inside a Class. But I&#x27;m getting to know std::unordered_map and std::map and they seem be extremely useful in this cases since they store elements as key-value pairs. So it becomes very easy to add, retrieve and manipulate.
 So getting back to the original question, in your expert experience what would be the best way to solve these type of problem? Going for std::unordered_list, using a std::vectors, or anything else? 
 Thanks!
 EDIT: Providing more information: I&#x27;ll need to add daily new members, and get information from them, so storing large amounts of data. The speed in which it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s not really that important.

                              <span>So I have recently started with Linux and don&#x27;t have Visual Studio. There are two options either go with Neovim or use CLion, I have a little experience with Vim as a Editor and was wondering with which one should I continue. My inclination is towards learning Neovim so I was wondering if it would be a right choice to go with it. Can it provide every functionality that an IDE does.

                              <span>So I have 10 projects each of which uses a file say important.cpp.. There&#x27;s a function in this file that takes a function as an argument. Now I want to call this function to be defined in another project ProjectA/file1.cpp. How do I do this.. 
 One approach I tried was declaring extern function() in important.cpp and then defining in file1.cpp.. While projectA built successfully.. Rest were failing due to linker error.. Symbols not resolved.
 Remember this function in important.cpp that takes in another function has default set as to null for fn.

Converting a function pointer to an object pointer type or vice versa is conditionally-supported.
  
Are there compilers where it is not supported?
 I have seen only compilers which support it. However, I haven&#x27;t seen all compilers. My guess, is that the answer comes from an area like the following ones:
  
Maybe a category of compilers does not support it, like e.g. &quot;it is typically not supported when you compile for processor/architecture X&quot;.
 It may be supported in all compilers nowadays, but it was not commonly supported say in the 1980s.

                              <span>I can join the strings (or anything string-like, string_view or const char*) with a constant delimiter like:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; template  struct SlashJoiner { std::ranges::ref_view view; };
 template  SlashJoiner(R) -&gt; SlashJoiner;
 template  struct std::formatter, CharT&gt; : range_formatter, CharT&gt; { constexpr formatter() { range_formatter, CharT&gt;::set_brackets(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;); range_formatter, CharT&gt;::set_separator(&quot; / &quot;); }
 auto format(const SlashJoiner&amp; joiner, auto&amp; ctx) const { return range_formatter, CharT&gt;::format(joiner.view, ctx); } 
 }; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And its usage would be:
  std::vector words { &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;def&quot;, &quot;ghi&quot; }; std::format(&quot;{::s}&quot;, SlashJoiner { words }); // &quot;abc / def / ghi&quot; 
 Now I want to specify the delimiter in Joiner struct, like:
  template  struct Joiner { std::ranges::ref_view view; std::string_view delimiter; }; 
 However, format function must be const, therefore it doesn&#x27;t let me call set_separator inside of it. What would be simple way for handle this problem?
  
Of course I know fmt::join and its implementation, but I&#x27;m curious that is there any fancy solution that using range_formatter&#x27;s ability by any chance.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I&#x27;m a beginner and currently trying to do an assignment which needs you to read from a text file. I am given a bunch of names and a set of numbers (don&#x27;t ask what those numbers mean). So the text file looks something like this:
 Michael 0 5 12 6 15 
 Jessica 1 3 4 8 20 
 George Martin 1 3 4 8 20 
 Olivia 2 8 10 12 17
 I have to store a name and the numbers for each participant. I know how to read from a text file, but I have problems with the third name. As you can see the third name has a space in between, but I still have to store it into one variable. This is the part which I am stuck at, since I know that if I write:
 fileIn &gt;&gt; name; 
 fileIn &gt;&gt; number[0] 
 it will store George as a name and then it will try to store &quot;Martin&quot; into the numbers array. What would be your approach in solving this problem? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to have a way to know how long a portion of my code takes to execute. In python, I would have done this by getting the current time at the start, and at the end, and taking the difference.
 The only way I&#x27;ve found to actually get this time is using time.h (as shown here), but this seems incredibly convoluted for just timing some blocks of code. Is there a better way to go about this?

                              <span>My understanding is that there is benefit to be had from sequential read access for data types equal to or smaller then 32 bytes because more then one can be loaded per cache line. Is there some benefit for larger data types? To ask the question another way: does memory locality / cache coherence matter at all when the desired bits are not in the same cache line?

                              <span>Hi DevOps Engineers! 
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with RAG (retrieval augmented generation) with terraform projects to build something useful in the world of DevOps. I&#x27;ve been asking my software friends what pain points they experience in the cloud deployment aspect of DevOps, especially when it comes to creating and managing cloud infrastructure. 
 I wanted to utilize my knowledge in ML and AI to perhaps enhance or improve DevOps workflows but I need to learn and listen to what the actual difficulties DevOps Engineers face in companies that I could perhaps explore as a hobby. 
 It would be amazing if people share problems that DevOps Engineers see could be solved by implementing some codebase integration with RAG and then perhaps using retrieved info with LLMs to make informed decisions? 
 I recently created a short demo which converts natural language queries to a runnable terraform deployment (The agent I coded for this hobby project also fetches relevant config parameters that might be needed for the Terraform Code). I wish I could embed it here but I don&#x27;t want to link my YouTube for the sake of anonymity. 
 Also, I&#x27;m just throwing ideas out here that aren&#x27;t fully fleshed out and looking for inspiration!

                              <span>I have several projects I need to support. Currently the infra provisioning (gcp, kubernetes etc) is in terraform. I’m trying to figure out what practices people use to let developers self manage what the requirements are for each individual project without seeing/interfering with each other.
 I’m imagining perhaps just argocd to monitor some kubectl files stored in each project repo, plus maybe some kind of yaml file to tell me what databases, redis, etc they need provisioned, then based on ci/cd pipeline i just have a job that parses the yaml and generates terraform config in the background? I don’t really want to have all teams messing about in the master terraform repo

 I&#x27;ve posted about Kviklet (pronounced &quot;Quicklet&quot;) multiple times in the past and got some very valuable feedback and some excitement by the community.
 Although I current don&#x27;t plan on founding a company around it and instead am just building a simple open-source tool for production access, there has been some significant progress.
 If you haven&#x27;t heard about Kviklet yet I recommend to skim through the Readme or one of the linked posts to get an idea.
 Enough introduction, this is what&#x27;s new in 0.3:
  
An integration with Kubernetes Exec, you can now run commands on other pods after they&#x27;ve been approved through kviklet. The idea behind this is that you can audit your script executions through Kviklet as well as database acces. If this works well we wi…</span>

 I had put out a small demo of my game in order drum up some publicity and get some feedback on the basic mechanics. I wrote the game in Monogame using entirely my own code. For the most part, the demo went down well without any bugs. However, 2 of the players experienced some very weird bugs. Luckily I caught this on video. 
  
First of all, the intro cutscene was extremely zoomed in, to the point where it was unintelligible.
 
The user interface was completely absent. Except for the life counter, but that was on the wrong side. 
 
The background for the second world was absent. The other worlds had their static background display but the dynamic elements were also abscent.

                              <span>On Twitter, there is a fun challenge going on:
 Pick any constant in your game code, multiply by 1000, and post the results.
 I had fun making my entry! Photons with 1000x the power. Somehow, my photon-mapper still managed to produce recognizable results.
 I guess most x1000 constants would totally break a game, but I was rather pleased with my experiment. The game felt like wandering the wastelands during a hydrogen bomb detonation. Interesting visuals! 
 Did you participate in the challenge? If so, let&#x27;s share on this subreddit too!

                              <span>Game development is a tough journey, if you plan to be successful.
 We have just crossed 2k sales 1yr after launch. Most of the recent ones on huge discounts, so we decided today to drop the regular price from 15$ to 5$.
 Background:
 We developed a game with three people for about three years next to our day-time jobs. We thought the idea of combining RPG and a guild collection topic with auto chess combat mechanics would be a fun one. And for a niche audience it actually is! Each positive review on steam makes me happy, and also the negative ones are mostly constructive, or it is just not someone&#x27;s cup of tea. We don&#x27;t take it personal. :-)
 Still, we hoped for a bit of a better outcome.
 A lesson learned is that marketability (appeal and readability) of the game is super important, and …</span>

I do see some huge differences in some areas, but not sure if I should quit or keep going. They are way farther along than I am, Kickstarter and all. What have some of you done when you have this happen? Suggestions, pep talks, and stop panicking face slaps needed, lol.

 use std::io::Write; fn main(){ println!(&quot;Hello from Rust to .NET!&quot;); std::fs::File::create(&quot;/tmp/rust_on_dotnet.txt&quot;).unwrap().write_all(b&quot;Hi from Rust, .NET&quot;).unwrap(); eprintln!(&quot;We are writing to stderr!&quot;); } 
 Can now run without issues within the .NET runtime!
 While this week has been a bit busy for me (first 3 final exams), I still made some progress in other areas too.
 Besides this, I have also eliminated 2 memory corruption errors (one related to closures, one related to small constant values). Those issues were found using valgrind - a memory debuting tool, which I now use to verify the Rust code compiled for .NET behaves correctly (the runtime can run under valgrind, if the right flags are set).
 I have also finished a round of extensive fuzzing (46 434 773 LOC of MIR test programs), which allowed me to find and patch many other issues (mostly related to floating-point numbers).
 Some issues still remain (13 out of 10 000 generated tests still fail, and the fuzzing tool I use does not check for every kind of bug), but a lot more Rust code should now compile properly.
 There is still a lot of work to do, but I wanted to share some of the progress.
 Also, the project has reached 1024(2^10) stars on GitHub! So, I would like to thank people for the amazing reception my project has had!
 If you have any questions/suggestions/whatever, feel free to ask.

                              <span>I used to use ranger (https://github.com/ranger/ranger) as my terminal file manager for a long time. But the app is really slow. I always thought this is just how terminal apps are like, and not much can be done about that. Ranger is written in Python.
 Then I discovered yazi (https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) which is similar to ranger but it&#x27;s blazing fast and snappy. It&#x27;s written in Rust.
 The functionality of these apps is pretty similar, but the snappyness of yazi yet again reminds me how fast and rock solid Rust programs could be. I just don&#x27;t understand why that&#x27;s the case though—it&#x27;s not like these apps do heavy number crunching or systems programming; they essentially provide a skin around terminal utilities such as ls and cd. Why is yazi so so faster then?

 But I&#x27;m not very strong in DSA. I got 2 month vacation from my college. I want to advance my DSA skills. From beginning I did DSA in C++.
 Last week I tried doing it in Golang. But I don&#x27;t like doing it in golang.
 Should I try it in Rust? Or should I continue in C++?

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1cp9rv8/thoughts_on_dbg_pretty_printing/">

                              <span>The dbg! macro is awesome, but I almost always use println! instead. I lose inline convenience and the automatic label, but I just can&#x27;t stand pretty printing.
 When I&#x27;m trying to print the context of some execution, I&#x27;m usually expecting a ton of repetitive text. I find this way easier to read when parallelized; just painless to pattern match, scan over, and read across dimensions. The patterns are automatically provided to you, they&#x27;re just there.
 What I want is this:
 [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [7, 10] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [7, 1] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [7, 2] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [7, 3] [src\comb.rs:1260:3] count &#x3D; [7, 0] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [7, 4] // .. 
 versus
 [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [ 7, 10, ] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [ 7, 1, ] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [ 7, 2, ] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [ 7, 3, ] [src\comb.rs:1260:3] count &#x3D; [ 7, 0, ] [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count &#x3D; [ 7, 4, ] // .. 
 This is actual dbg! output from my program, which also demonstrates how pretty printing can even be unnecessarily confusing. The lines [src\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count and [src\comb.rs:1260:3] count are very similar, but in the single-line example it&#x27;s much easier to spot the odd one out.
 I can copy-paste the source code into my own macro, but for a debug tool that I&#x27;d wanna use everywhere and anywhere it&#x27;s just not the same. Is there an environment variable or some way to disable pretty printing everywhere? I&#x27;ve searched, but found none.
 Either way, curious to hear your thoughts on pretty printing for debug output.
 Your dearest friend,
 Yokin

 We build an error handling solution with stack trace for large Rust projects like GreptimeDB. In practices, it display errors like:
 Failed to handle protocol 0: Failed to handle incoming content, query: blabla, at src/protocol/handler.rs:89:22 1: Failed to reading next message at queue 5 of 10, at src/protocol/loop.rs:254:14 2: Failed to decode &#x60;01010001001010001&#x60; to ProtocolHeader, at src/protocol/codec.rs:90:14 3: serde_json(invalid character at position 1) 
 Previously, errors in Rust mainly report the root cause, but it lacks a lot of context with which developers can debug the error. Moreover, std Backtrace brings a lot of unrelated intermediate stacks and increases a significant runtime overhead.
 Our solution is built upon snafu, which is like a combination of thiserror and anyhow, with less than 1% runtime overhead and binary size.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m new to Go, and was surprised how much boiler plate code was required to use (I guess technically implement) a heap in Go when compared to say Java or C++. I&#x27;m trying to understand why this is the case.
 I understand that the sort interface needs to be implemented along with Push and Pop. From my newbie POV it seems that the reason why other languages only require a comparator is because priority queue&#x27;s in Java and C++ are able to provide a concrete heap implementation through generics? So is this a vestige of pre-generics Go?
 I&#x27;d appreciate any discussion as to why this was the choice taken, as I&#x27;m hoping to get a better understanding of Go and become more gopher :).

                              <span>Hi everyone! Recently, my workplace stopped paying for JetBrains licenses, so all Go developers have to switch to Visual Studio Code. Our company doesn&#x27;t allow us to use personal licenses either. I&#x27;m looking for people who have switched from GoLand to VS Code; if they have any tips or extensions to make the transition easier, please share them.

                              <span>In this go code:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; package main
 import &quot;fmt&quot;
 func returnPointer() *int32 { var a int32 a &#x3D; 4 return &amp;a }
 func main() { b :&#x3D; 4 a :&#x3D; returnPointer() fmt.Println(&quot;a &#x3D; &quot;, *a) fmt.Println(&quot;b &#x3D; &quot;, *(&amp;b)) } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The gcflags verbose output gives:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 command-line-arguments
 ./a.go:5:6: can inline returnPointer ./a.go:13:20: inlining call to returnPointer ./a.go:14:13: inlining call to fmt.Println ./a.go:15:13: inlining call to fmt.Println ./a.go:6:6: moved to heap: a ./a.go:14:13: ... argument does not escape ./a.go:14:14: &quot;a &#x3D; &quot; escapes to heap ./a.go:14:22: *a escapes to heap ./a.go:15:13: ... argument does not escape ./a.go:15:14: &quot;b &#x3D; &quot; escapes to heap ./a.go:15:22: *(&amp;b) escapes to heap &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Why does b escape to the heap? It can be stack allocated since its function scoped right?

                              <span>Sorry if this is the wrong place to post, and i’m sure my terminology is bad.
 With the amount of hate HP printers rightfully get for their restrictions (bricking printers without a subscription or using 3rd part ink), you would think someone would have found a work around. Have I been looking in the wrong places, or am I just being an armchair redditor right now?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 Just a basic question I want to ask. Recently, I&#x27;ve been doing some code reviews and playing CTFs, all of which I&#x27;m doing on the provided machine over an SSH connection. However, whatever I do on the provided SSH server is getting logged in a file and somewhere else as well, but I don&#x27;t have access to read or write these logs. Now, every single command that I run on their machine gets logged, and there&#x27;s a challenge where I have to initiate an SSH connection or run any UNIX commands without them being logged into that file.
 Is there any way to do this? Also, I was thinking if I write a Python or Bash script and then perform tasks on the provided machine, maybe only the execution of the script with its name will get logged.
 Does anyone have an idea or suggestions on HOWTO do this?

 But when I try to open the archive it doesn&#x27;t work, says the passwords wrong, but it&#x27;s a match for the hash so how is that possible?

                              <span>I gathered this data from the two most comprehensive sources out there: TrueUp.io and Layoffs.fyi.
 Here&#x27;s a quick summary of the findings below:
  
There are 29.5% more tech job openings today than the low hit last March, and this positive trend has been largely steady
 The YoY number of average daily tech layoffs has declined by roughly 20%
  
Notes on the stats below: the difference in total numbers is due to TrueUp&#x27;s much larger dataset (it tracks more startups &amp; non-US markets). Both still show a nice improvement --- the decline in average daily layoffs is around 24% on TrueUp and 14% on Layoffs.fyi. Also, I rounded the figures to the nearest 1K.
 TrueUp.io
  
There are 211K open tech jobs today; there were 163K at the March 3, 2023 low. That said, the peak was 478K in April &#x27;22
 In 2023, there were 429K people laid off by 2,001 tech companies (an average of 1,175 people/day)
 So far in 2024, there have been 118K people laid off by 540 tech companies (an average of 891 people/day)
  
Layoffs.fyi
  
In 2023, there were 263K people laid off by 1,191 tech companies (an average of 721 people/day)
 So far in 2024, there have been 81K people laid off by 287 tech companies (an average of 619 people/day)
  
If it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s improving, hang in there. No market moves in a straight line...but at least the bumpy ride appears to be on the right track!
 Edit: accidentally typed 2014 in body - updated to 2024.

                              <span>Any tips how to get in to Papa Johns? I’ve heard only good things about Prapy. It’s my dream job, I’ve been prepping leetcode hard and even doing in person reconnaissance of some locations to get a feel for the work culture (i was pretending to buy pizza).
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello all. I&#x27;ve been working as an embedded software engineer for about 8 years and wanted to move my career in the direction of backend and cloud. I was just rejected from a role after completing a take home assignment writing a simple RESTful API for a microservice managing one resource. The position was a Golang position (which I admittedly have no experience in) but the assignment did not have to be written in Go. I decided to write it in Go anyways because:
  
I would need to learn the language if I were to be hired for the position anyways.
 
It would be nice to learn a new language and it&#x27;s ecosystem even if I were to be rejected.
 
 So I poured my heart into learning Go and some select frameworks. I honestly thought I did well enough on the assignment considering it&#x27;s my first real attempt to write something in Go that isn&#x27;t absolutely trivial. I was not given any feedback for where I went wrong so I&#x27;m left in the dark here. Can any of you give me some feedback on my code? Really appreciate the time.

 EDIT:
 I&#x27;d like to thank you all for the enormous feedback. It&#x27;s heavily appreciated. Never thought that I would have received so much in such a short time frame. I think I have a clear understanding of where the weak points lie now for future projects. I&#x27;ll definitely be incorporating some of the suggestions in future projects. Perhaps even make changes to this one for the sake of completeness.
 As for the job, while I am a bit disappointed after sinking in hours into this project, I&#x27;m just treating it as part of the learning experience.
 I probably won&#x27;t have the time to respond to any new comments. But I&#x27;d like to thank everybody again.
 Golang is a lovely language. :)

                              <span>Hi. I am the author of the expriemental programming language specification 3Rus. I have released 0.1 of the specification. This is 10x simpler than C++ as this removes 7 keywords consteval, constinit, constexpr, concept, requires, template and typename. This introduces one new keyword _. Besides few others are introduced but those could be considered as same as older ones e.g. if1 and for1 have similar semantics to if and for. Besides, this removes macros and has reflection. Libraries like CTRE and serialization of any kind would become tremendously easy to achieve in this.
 But I have a feeling that semantics are incorrect and it is not what it appears to be. Please help me find out my mistake.
 This is an incomplete specification and only discusses language semantics from generics and reflection perspective and does not consider other aspects of the programming language.
 Please share your thoughts. https://github.com/HassanSajjad-302/3Rus/tree/0.1

                              <span>So I&#x27;m thinking of learning a C++ GUI framework now and I wanted to hear people&#x27;s opinions on which is best. People say QT is great because it&#x27;s very fast and has lots of features, but the licensing model makes me a bit uneasy. If I had to some day, how much would I be able to do with just LGPL components?
 GTK is cross platform, but it seems native look is not a priority for them. This leads to strange inconsistencies in different UIs which might confuse users. Is GTK still the best option for performance reasons? Or does QT have better performance too?
 Finally there&#x27;s wxWidgets. They compile to native toolkits on every platform, so it&#x27;s probably the best for native look and feel. But is there a performance overhead because of the bindings and platform specific stuff?
 What does everyone think?
 Edit: I thought of another potential advantage of GTK: It has Rust bindings. I don&#x27;t think any of the others do.

                              <span>I work on a shared library. I implemented class and struct like this: 
 namespace cpp_practicing { struct ImageSample { cv::Mat descriptors; }; class PoseEstimator { // some methods ... private: cv::Mat query_image; }; } 
 I import OpenCV headers in my header file:
 #include  #include  #include  
 My CMakeLists.txt is following:
 project(camera_pose_estimation_lib) set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS &quot;${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -Werror -Wextra -O2 -lopencv_imgproc&quot;) # OpenCV find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED) set(OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE &quot;Enable non-free algorithms&quot; ON) INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS}) # Link Conan ... include_directories(${CONAN_INCLUDE_DIRS} &quot;include&quot;) # add source files file(GLOB_RECURSE SOURCES &quot;src/*.cpp&quot;) add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} SHARED ${SOURCES}) target_link_libraries( ${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${OpenCV_LIBS} ${Boost_LIBRARIES}) ... # add tests add_subdirectory(test) 
 Structure of project:
 ├── CMakeLists.txt ├── conanfile.py ├── include │ └── PoseEstimator.h ├── src │ └── PoseEstimator.cpp └── test ├── CMakeLists.txt └── LibraryTest.cpp 
 When I compile I get following error
 /usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/library_test.dir/LibraryTest.cpp.o: undefined reference to symbol &#x27;_ZN2cv3MatD1Ev&#x27; /usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libopencv_core.so.409: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status 
 If I comment out line with field query_image in class PoseEstimator everything compiles without errors.
 What can be the problem here?

                              <span>Although I don&#x27;t like to do it, sometimes I need to use friend declarations to give private access to external classes/functions. Whenever I do, those external entities only need access to 1 or 2 members of the private class. But, giving friendship opens up the entire insides to the friends. So, it can become difficult to understand which privates get used externally, without inspecting the friends. To try to keep things sane, I segregate those members to their own private section. Best I can do is put comments to say they are used externally.
 private: // These are used by friends Foo mBar; Some Function(); private: //... Other private sections are not used by friends. 
 I wish C++ supported a &#x27;friend:&#x27; access specifier in classes, similar to public/protected/private.
 friend: Foo mBar; Some Function(); private: // ... 
 If a class has a &#x27;friend:&#x27; section, then those members are consider private, and they can be accessed by friend classes/functions. If such a section is present, the friend classes/functions are not allowed to access other private sections.
 It would be nice to have limited friendship.

 Code smells are driving me up a wall in our CI pipeline. Can anyone explain to me why the following is good practice? I got this smell from sonarqube.
 &quot;Avoid explicitly specifying the template arguments by relying on the class template argument deduction.&quot;
 While I understand you don&#x27;t have to specify the template in c++17, in what world is this bad practice? This seems insanely pedantic to me for no good reason, but maybe I am missing something?

 Why isn&#x27;t there a C++ Collective on StackOverflow? Were there efforts to create it?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been working with C++ professionally for about a decade, but I&#x27;ve been sticking to knowing as much as I need to in order to write correct and readable code. I&#x27;m transferring to a team whose mission is basically: be C++ experts for the rest of the organization. So now I need to know why and how I&#x27;m doing what I&#x27;m doing.
 What would be the most efficient way to fill in my knowledge gaps? I have gaps in more simple things like the nuances of move semantics, and on the other side of the spectrum I&#x27;m pretty unaware of more advanced techniques like metaprogramming beyond the simplest use case. I also need to build a better intuition of how a certain line of code would exactly translate to machine instructions, and fold that intuition into how I write code.
 I&#x27;ve been watching some cppcon videos to start, and I think the next step might be to reread all of the basic C++ books to make sure I fill in all of the more basic unknowns.

                              <span>I recently came across this neat ErrorOr pattern, while looking through SerenityOS, which works like this:
 ErrorOr GetFoo() { return Foo{}; } auto foo &#x3D; TRY( GetFoo() ); 
 The ErrorOr is simply a wrapper around their own variant type (exactly like std::variant as far as i can tell) with is_error, release_error, release_valuefunctions as alternatives to std::holds_variant, and std::get.
 The only thing that im not a big fan of is the way that the TRY macro is implemented (simplified):
 #define TRY(expr)\ ({\ auto&amp;&amp; tmp &#x3D; (expr);\ if(tmp.is_error())\ return tmp.release_error();\ tmp.release_value()\ }) 
 which only works because of GCC statement expressions (and apparently also works on clang but definitely not on msvc)
 I was wondering if anybody knew of a standard compliant way to implement this maco? Or a msvc equivalent implementation that i could just switch over to when compiling on msvc?

                              <span>I get when to use constexpr for variables. The question arises for constexpr functions: We can mark a function to be constexpr even though we dont know the parameters at compile time, what&#x27;s the point? If we know the parameters and we want to force the evaluation at compile time consteval can just be used

                              <span>So I am a bit confused. I thought you could never reference something below, only above. And when I write a struct underneath my main but try to use it in main then the code fails as expected. 
 However, if we take the following example:
 class some_class { public: void print_hello() { print_out(&quot;Hello&quot;); } private: void print_out(std::string s) { std::cout &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; std::endl; } }; 
 This works, and I am so confused. I can write some_class{}.print_hello(); and it will write out &quot;Hello&quot;, but I thought this was not allowed because print_hello() is trying (successfully) to use a function declared below it. 
 Could someone help me understand when and why something must be declared before it can be used?

                              <span>I use CMake buildsystem with Clang compiler (which is my macOS system default). I fetch fmt from vcpkg manifest mode, and when I link it to my project it works okay. However, if I use GCC, it emits error (seems ABI issue, fmt is built by Clang but project uses GCC):
  /opt/homebrew/Cellar/cmake/3.29.0/bin/cmake --build cpp-playground/cmake-build-debug --target cpp-playground -j 6 [1/1] Linking CXX executable cpp-playground FAILED: cpp-playground : &amp;&amp; /opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/14.1.0/bin/g++-14 -g -arch arm64 -isysroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX14.4.sdk -Wl,-search_paths_first -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names CMakeFiles/cpp-playground.dir/main.cpp.o -o cpp-playground -Wl,-rpath,/opt/homebrew/lib /opt/homebrew/lib/libfmt.10.2.1.dylib &amp;&amp; : Undefined symbols for architecture arm64: &quot;fmt::v10::vformat[abi:cxx11](fmt::v10::basic_string_view, fmt::v10::basic_format_args&gt;)&quot;, referenced from: _main in main.cpp.o ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64 collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status 
 If I use CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER&#x3D;g++-14, how can I force vcpkg to use gcc for dependency compilation? In general, how can I match vcpkg compiler and CMake compiler?

                              <span>I have been working with a pretty ancient windows desktop application whose initial release date predates me. Its development team recently wrapped some of its functionality as an unmanaged dll for us so that we can incorporate it into our aspnet based microservice application. Currently we are using .net&#x27;s foreign function interface (PInvoke) to call the library, however it is a bit fragile and we have to meet a few odd requirements like using a thread with a non-standard max stack size.
 I am thinking maybe I should wrap the api calls in a separate program (probably written in c++) to execute c++ calls that I will run in a separate process and use ipc to communicate. This will probably be a bit more robust as I can recover from process crashes and do not need to implement a producer/consumer queue with a separate thread etc. to schedule api calls. However I also feel like I am overcomplicating things. Did any of you had to deal with a similar problem? If so, got any recommendations?

 I&#x27;ve been playing around with designing an API in C++20 for an internal project and stumbled upon what seems like a fresh approach to handling event callbacks. I&#x27;m excited about it but unsure if it&#x27;s a well-known technique. I&#x27;d love to get your thoughts and insights on it.
 The Challenge:
 Imagine you have a function Process() that needs to keep others in the loop by firing events like Started, Stopped, and Error during its execution.
 Approach 1: Classic Runtime Interface
 In traditional C++ style, you might set up an interface like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;cpp struct IObserver { virtual void OnStarted() &#x3D; 0; virtual void OnStopped() &#x3D; 0; virtual void OnError(std::string const&amp; error) &#x3D; 0; };
 void Process(IObserver&amp; observer) { observer.OnStarted(); if (something_went_wrong) { observer.O…</span>

                              <span>I recently had a very disappointing and disrespectful experience during the recruitment process with Current (FinTech company). 
 I was assigned a medium level take-home assessment. The recruiter had mentioned that I had a week to work on it, and to email him if I had any questions or concerns on it.
 The take home assessment required a lot of time and effort, but I was able to complete it. It took me about a week to complete. 
 HOWEVER,
 I found myself reaching out to the recruiter to only get completely ghosted from the recruiter.
 The only acknowledgment I received was an impersonal, automated rejection email that offered no personal communication or constructive feedback.
 The best part: I also found out through the submission platform that my work had not even been reviewed! 
 What&#x27;s the point of asking candidates to dedicate effort to a take-home task if it&#x27;s going to be IGNORED??? Super disrespectful and unprofessional to request detailed work from candidates and then disregard it entirely.
 I urge potential candidates to be very cautious. Current&#x27;s hiring approach demonstrates not only a lack of professionalism but also a disregard for basic respect and decency. 
 This experience highlighted a profound disrespect and unprofessionalism that prospective applicants should seriously consider before applying!

                              <span>Last year, I joined a company that seemed too laid-back. Despite good pay, I have little responsibility and have to share simplest of tasks with other developers, which creates a lot of overhead for &quot;collaboration.&quot; My coworkers often take long lunch breaks or disappear during the day, leaving me blocked.
 Unsurprisingly even minor projects take ages to complete, with many people involved. Now the company is struggling with revenue and talking about running out of funding. Meanwhile, we have well-funded competitors that are executing much more effectively
 I&#x27;m not sure what to do. The job market is f&#x27;ed, and I don&#x27;t want to go through the grind again. Talking to the tech leadership would likely either be ignored or get me fired, as they are the ones who set up this enrivonment in the first place and don&#x27;t see the situation the same way I do.
 What would you do if you were in my shoes?

Schedule A occupations are pre-certified and thus employers do NOT have to prove that they first sought American workers for a green card job. This comes on the heels of massive layoffs from the very people pushing this rule change.
 From Tech Target:
  
&quot;The proposed exemption could be applied to a broad range of tech occupations including, notably, software engineering -- which represents about 1.8 million U.S. positions, according to U.S. labor statistics data -- and would allow companies to bypass some labor market tests if there&#x27;s a demonstrated shortage of U.S. workers in an occupation.&quot;

 The only time you should sweat deadlines are if you&#x27;ve been being lazy and intentionally unproductive, and cant provide a reasonable explanation on how it got missed.
 Don&#x27;t spend what should be a relaxing dinner time pondering if you&#x27;ll sign in two hours early tomorrow to try to meet some c-suites timeline.
 Those deadlines are for your manager to handle. It is not on you barring you intentionally not trying.
 Most people here do not work at a company that are changing peoples lives via medicine or health. 
 Don&#x27;t give them your life. They will spit you up and chew you out even if you do everything right.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know why, but for some reason I have to explain to everyone that higher living expenses don&#x27;t negate the benefit of a higher wage. Double the income with double the expenses also doubles the savings.
 Your take home pay is basically &#x3D; (Income - Expenses)
 30,000 &#x3D; 50,000-20,000 for a good mid-west job (really rough, not realistic)
 double both living and income and we get
 60,000 &#x3D; 100,000-40,000 for a good city job (really rough, not realistic just an example)
 This is something people in companies also don&#x27;t know, I think we just accept some statements as truth and leave it at that, but it&#x27;s not true and just requires basic math. If both of the only variables go up, then any result of that variable will also shoot up, so THP &#x3D; (Income-Expenses) is the same as 2THP &#x3D; 2(Income-Expenses).

                              <span>Data suggests employees are feeling trapped and ready to quit. 85% of professionals are looking for a new job. The current regime of low attrition is ready to break as job satisfaction ticks down. Employers seem convinced they&#x27;re back in control of the market however they&#x27;re soon going to be faced with massive turnover and the costs that go with that. As this turnover ramps up employers will be once again competing with each other to attract and retain talent. The pendulum swung too hard and too fast back to employers and now it&#x27;s likely to swing back just as hard. The volatility in the job market is set to continue for years to come and this is a real opportunity for those unphased by it.
 My question for many of you is: Are you looking for a job and why? Planning to hold on for dear life? Are you burnt out?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 After having released my game as a solo-dev about a month ago, I thought it would be a good idea to share my data and experiences as an interesting reference for your own projects.
 Here is the raw data:
  
Lifetime Steam revenue (gross): $73,684
 Lifetime Steam revenue (net): $61,188
 Lifetime Steam units: 5,626
 Lifetime units returned: -457 (8.1% of Steam units)
 Median time played: 6 hours 25 minutes
 Current Wishlists: 19,219
  
My game: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2026000/Our_Adventurer_Guild/
 Background:
 Unlike many people here, making a game was not my dream job, nor have I ever thought about making a game when I was a kid. I like gaming and do it a lot, but my true passion was more about drawing and creating stories. I always wanted to maybe draw a web comic…</span>

                              <span>We have been working on our game for about 5 months. And no one outside of us has played the game. Just recently we started to reach out to people and looking for playtesters. Finally, we got our first one. A YouTube content creator offered to play our game on twitter.
 Anyway
 As he played, he ran into a lot bugs. While annoying, ( everyone wants their game to be as polished as possible when someone plays it) this wasn’t really the surprising part, instead it was immensely helpful. I wrote them all down to be fixed. Some bugs he found I didn’t even know about, nor would I have been able to find them as breaking your own game is harder than you first think.
 Here&#x27;s the thing that surprised me. It was when he started asking things like
 &quot;How?&quot;
 &quot;What am I supposed to do right now?&quot;

 Is there a relatively inexpensive way of creating/obtaining art assets that doesn&#x27;t involve AI? I have enough vision to check whether the art is of quality and within the realm of what I want - I don&#x27;t have enough to draw, not at speed.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m new to programming and I have an existential question about C. One of the exercises I have to solve now in my course is to create a function that will join two strings into a new one, and I&#x27;m allowed to use malloc. That&#x27;s all the specification I have:
 prototype: char *join_strings(char const *string1, char const *string2) return NULL if allocation fails 
 It doesn&#x27;t say anything about handling a NULL pointer, It&#x27;s up to me to decide and justify my choice. So I could either return NULL if any of the parameters is NULL, or I could return a pointer to a copy of the non-null parameter.
 What would an experienced C programmer do instinctively by default?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got bored and would like to ask everyone on exact name of Operating System and Organisation you would like to see in the future and maybe what you would expect when interacting with it.
 This is my take: https://opencollective.com/public-domain-laboratories/projects/pdl_operating_system
 It&#x27;s not functional, it barely have anything. What I dislike about the name is how it sounds and looks as an acronym: pdlos
 For me acronym is important, as it is shortest way to refer to it on search engines and in a more social settings.

 8YoE here, got a new manager. A couple of weeks ago a bug comes up, i fix it, he gives me shit for it, doesn&#x27;t allow the fix to go ahead, and says i got it wrong.
 He then proceeds to make a deal out of it, intentionally says in the standup, in front of his own boss too how &quot;he was let down, and that feature is broken still&quot;.
 Literally less than 2 weeks later, he comes back and asks me to apply the same fix i did initially, because &quot;he evaluated the situation, and found it best&quot;.
 He made me look like i have no idea what I&#x27;m doing in front of the team and management.
 Dude also micromanages, with things like &quot;i sometimes look at branches, so don&#x27;t push any code you haven&#x27;t personally tested, even if it&#x27;s to a branch you&#x27;re not intending on opening a PR for&quot; lol.
 A few days ago we had a 1:1, and unprovoked he tells me &quot;you need to know something, I&#x27;m the boss! I make decisions, it&#x27;s my team&quot; this wasn&#x27;t in response to something i said. No, he literally just stated it

                              <span>I’ve written some code for my own project in my own time. And it would greatly help fix a number of bugs and improve the product at my place of employment if i add it to the codebase. 
 However i’m concerned that if i do copy the code into the repo, then that code will suddenly become property of the company i work for.
 I’m not sure whether to raise the issue or who/how to raise it.
 Has anyone here navigated this issue before?
 Some thoughts are:
  
I could create an open git repo with the code and publish it as a package with the appropriate license, then install that package in the product at work.
 
See if i can rewrite the code so it works the same way but looks a little different somehow/ or ask an LLM to rewrite and mix it up a bit so it’s not the same syntax 
 
Setup a contract that somehow states that both i and the business have a perpetual license to do whatever we want with the code (even writing it down here sounds stupid and is likely impossible/problematic legally)

                              <span>Let me explain.
 So I observed a behavior in development teams. I’m not sure if this has an established name. When teams have changing managers, they might end up having to explain basic things about their work to the newcoming manager. The newcoming manager might not actually listen or understand what’s actually going on in the team, and just tries to adapt a methodology they find matching, or what they bring from their previous experience, without assessing how information actually flows, what are the actual dependencies, constraints, etc.
 Developers will easily just get tired of explaining basic things over and over again. And this is where the attitude kicks in:
  
I just pay the tax, and they leave me alone

                              <span>We&#x27;re trying to set up a development environment for our microservice stack and we&#x27;re trying to get it as close to production as possible in terms of what data is available, what kinds of requests go through it, etc.
 I&#x27;ve heard of people doing things like &quot;snapshotting prod database to replicate it in dev/staging&quot; to get the database similar. I&#x27;ve also seen things like &quot;duplicate a function inside of an API call in code, and log the results so you can check the logs to see how things work&quot;...which I guess is kind of a way to &quot;dev with production traffic&quot; but you have to do some sloppy work using production logging to see what happens.
 In the classic dev env -&gt; test env -&gt; staging env -&gt; prod env set up, I&#x27;m curious how people here make sure the pre-production environments are similar to prod? How close are you able to get?

                              <span>I’ve been programming for a while, but I’m new to devops and deploying a full stack app. Before, I would just spin up a DigitalOcean server, manually pull my code, and just run it using something like PM2. I’m looking for something a little cleaner this time around with CI/CD practices. But, I’m lost on what service to use. There’s so many between Vercel, Render, AWS, Firebase, and more. I have a few services to run, so I’m looking for advice.
 There’s the app built in Expo, which interacts with an API. The API schedules jobs using BullMQ (Which uses Redis), and there’s a lightweight worker that fulfills those jobs (The worker just sends some HTTP requests and interacts with a Postgres database).
 So I have to host - Redis - Postgres (Hosted by Supabase at the moment) - An API (Node) - Worker (Node)
 I was thinking the worker would be a good fit for a serverless function, though I’ve never worked with them. If I go with AWS, Redis and BullMQ can be replaced with SQS, but AWS is also pretty complex for what I feel is a relatively simple app.
 What would you do? Should I just bite the bullet and finally learn AWS properly?

                              <span>I’m part of a team, but frankly I’m the one doing the majority of the work. 
 software engineers and managers just come up to me whenever they have issues because they know my team don’t know how to do anything. 
 It comes to a point where even if I go on vacation for a week or so, they’ll halt some processes until I return because they don’t want my team to break stuff.
 Even when I implement stuff and guide them through it so they follow best practices, they mess things up. They just send their PRs to each other and approve blindly.
 This is because the corporate has a new policy of relocating most r&amp;d to a different region to save money. That region, is not qualified for the job to say the least. 
 I don’t want to fight, really. But I just can’t compromise on stuff like that, they keep damaging my work. And I’ve tried so much to align them with basic standards..
 I can’t revoke my own team’s permissions, I have no one to complain to since they relocated my management to the same region as these employees so it’s a cabal. 
 Is the only choice left is to bail ?

                              <span>What do you use at your workplace? If anyone here who works/worked at Microsoft, what do you guys use? 
 I want to move my team away from Azure DevOps to GitHub. Want to understand if anyone has been on this journey and your learnings from it. 
 Appreciate any inputs. Thanks. 
 Edit: Reasons for considering move to GHE: 1. CoPilot capabilities 2. Better native SaaS integration 3. Moving away from a potential near future legacy platform

                              <span>I hope this is the right place to post this haha! I’ve been working on a project regarding the ILOVEYOU worm, and I am stumped as to why it overwrote files? If I understand correctly, the end goal of the worm was to propagate the Borak trojan to steal passwords. If this is true, though, I fail to see why it overwrote unrelated files with copies of itself?

                              <span>I’m working on this project for my ethical hacking course to where I need to gain access to a Windows Server 2012 R2 VM with a Kali Linux VM without knowing the username or password to the Windows VM. I’ve got the host name to the system but the next question on the project is “What is the login username and password for the VM?” I’ve literally tried everything I know from nmap to msfconsole to try using ms17-010 eternalblue but it just says the system is not vulnerable. I’m at a loss can someone teach me…

                              <span>hii, im doing the extension for a school project. im trying to scan from the file into 2 strings (one contains just the name, to check if its the name of the guy im getting rid of) and then the rest of the line in a function.
 i dont know what more to say, because i have no idea why its not working. for the sake of this reddit post, ive gotten rid of the if/else which gets rid of the targeted name because that works, its just the scanning which is a problem.
 i havent tried formatting code before so if i do it wrong lmk
 int dataDel(char name[]){ FILE *monarchs&#x3D;fopen(&quot;MonarchsData.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;); if(fileCheck(monarchs)&#x3D;&#x3D;1) //error for file not opening return 1; else{ //scan from file and delete the target mwahaha char liner[1000][20]; char nameLiner[500][20]; int i&#x3D;0; while(fscanf(monarchs, &quot;%s&quot;, nameLiner[i])!&#x3D;EOF){ fscanf(monarchs, &quot;%[^\n]&quot;, &amp;liner[i]); //scans everything that isnt newline i++; } fclose(monarchs); monarchs&#x3D;fopen(&quot;MonarchsData.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;); //rewriting the file without the name line for(int j&#x3D;0; j&lt;i; j++){ fprintf(monarchs, &quot;%s %s\n&quot;, nameLiner[j], liner[j]); //printing back to the file } fclose(monarchs); } //end of else return 0; }

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently pursuing a Master&#x27;s in Computer Science and expect to graduate in the next six months. My background includes an undergrad degree in Computer Science and several software engineering internships. I have a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming using Java, as well as web and mobile development with technologies like React and Node.js.
 While I consider myself proficient in developing products, I’m aware that the rise of workflow automation might impact the relevance of some skills I currently possess. To stay ahead, I’m planning to deepen my expertise in C programming and explore branches such as embedded programming and advanced uses of C/C++.
 I have a decent handle on solving LeetCode problems and a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms. However, I aim to achieve a deeper understanding of programming and want to have skills that can make me a better developer and a valuable employee.
 I’m here to ask for advice and pointers from those with more experience. Should I focus on C/C++ for embedded systems, or are there other areas within systems programming I should consider? I am also taking a Computer Systems course on the side. I appreciate all the feedbacks I can get - roadmaps, youtube series, project ideas, literally anything. Thank you. 
 PS - I am also trying to explore if I really like programming in C in long-term so I want to go in-depth. I can put in work but I am not sure about the path to follow.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m trying to follow the Vulkan tutorial, yet I&#x27;m coding in C instead of C++. Additionally, I&#x27;m coding in Visual Studio with the horrible MSVC compiler which doesnt allow me to simply write &#x60;VkPhysicalDevice devices[deviceCount]&#x60;.
 No problem, I thought, I&#x27;m just going to use malloc.
 Yes problem. For whatever reason, this fails spectacularily (Access violation writing location ...), no clue why.
 uint32_t deviceCount &#x3D; 0;
 vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(*instance, &amp;deviceCount, 0);
 VkPhysicalDevice *devices &#x3D; malloc(sizeof(VkPhysicalDevice) * deviceCount);
 vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(*instance, &amp;deviceCount, devices);
 Whereas this works fine.
 uint32_t deviceCount &#x3D; 0;
 vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(*instance, &amp;deviceCount, 0);
 VkPhysicalDevice devices[2]; // in my case deviceCount is 2
 vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(*instance, &amp;deviceCount, devices);
 From my understanding, there shouldn&#x27;t be a difference as arrays are basically pointers to memory space anyways... Can anyone explain?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I always used Valgrind to detect memory errors and it works fine IMO but it&#x27;s a bit slow, hence,
 i decided to try Gcc Sanitizer which seems to be more fast but there are some cases for which it doesn&#x27;t detect memory leaks.
 For example, I had a global variable in my program which was heap allocated and gcc sanitizer can&#x27;t detected it.
 For other cases instead, it works.
 Had anyone a similar experience ?
 Best regards.

                              <span>Yesterday I came up with this error-handling pattern in C:
 The return type of a function is a struct with an &quot;is_error&quot; bool, and a union of the error, or the data you want to return. The error can contain an enum so the specific errors can be resolved in code, and a char* to a descriptive error message for easier debugging. What do you think? Do you use something similar, or have a better way of handling errors?
 Here&#x27;s some example code which can be run in godbolt:
 ​
 #include  #include  #include  #define _STRINGIFY(x) #x #define STRINGIFY(x) _STRINGIFY(x) #define ERROR_STRING(string_literal) &quot;ERROR in &quot;__FILE__ &quot; line #&quot; STRINGIFY(__LINE__) string_literal typedef struct { bool is_error; union { struct { enum {MakeEggs_error_TemperatureLow, MakeEggs_error_…</span>

                              <span>For some context, I am very new to Linux and am trying to make a program that moves any files that I &quot;delete&quot; to a &quot;recycle folder&quot; rather than just deleting it using rm (the idea was to use an alias for this program in place of rm).
 This being said, I have successfully set the program to move any files I specify, however, folders do not work as expected (neither does recursion). What linux calls can I use to move folders (recursively)?

                              <span>I am reading the book &quot;The C Programming Language,&quot; an amazing book by the way. In the last chapter about the Unix system, there is a part about building the fopen function with system calls. In this, we use some kind of internal flags, for example, _READ instead of O_RDONLY. In the implementation, it uses both the POSIX and the internal flags. As I understand it, it uses both because in order to detect if some FILE has write privileges, for example, you can intersect bits, and if the intersection is different than 0, it has the privilege. However, this breaks when using O_RDONLY because it has the value 0, so it is not possible to detect if a combination of flags has the O_RDONLY flag with this aproach.
 So my question is, why does POSIX start with 0 instead of 1 and shift the rest by 2*n?
 (Maybe the answer is obvious, but I don&#x27;t see it.)

                              <span>Hi, I wrote a very small module that prints something onto the terminal like fmt or log, but it shows the file and line number where it is called as well. It can also print out the function that wraps over it and the function that wraps over the function that wraps over it... spreading out the whole calling hierarchy onto the terminal. In this way, when debugging, I can quickly locate which line is doing the complaining by clicking the link on my terminal.
 The code is here: https://github.com/Yifeeeeei/butterknife
 A quick example here, the comments show the output:
 package main ​ import ( &quot;github.com/Yifeeeeei/butterknife&quot; ) ​ func main() { a :&#x3D; &quot;a&quot; b :&#x3D; &quot;b&quot; butterknife.Print(a, b) // [main.go:10 main.main] ab ​ butterknife.Println(a, b) // [main.go:13 main.main] a b ​ butterknife.Printf(&quot;a:%s ,b:%s\n&quot;, a, b) // [main.go:16 main.main] a:a ,b:b ​ caller() } ​ func caller() { c :&#x3D; &quot;c&quot; d :&#x3D; &quot;d&quot; butterknife.PrintHierarchy(c, d) // [main.go:19 main.main] // [main.go:25 main.caller] // cd ​ butterknife.PrintlnHierarchy(c, d) // [main.go:19 main.main] // [main.go:30 main.caller] // c d ​ butterknife.PrintfHierarchy(&quot;c:%s ,d:%s\n&quot;, c, d) // [main.go:19 main.main] // [main.go:35 main.caller] // c:c ,d:d } ​ 
 Right now it only supports 12 different styles (print with fmt/log, print/printf/println, with/without hierarchy), but I may add more functionalities to it later.

                              <span>Here we go, I just published another article on my blog 🚀 This time I decided to implement a DNS Resolver from scratch, using Go applying Test Driven Development 🥸.
 Are you curious about DNS, binary protocols, Go or TDD? Well, take a look then! 🕵🏻‍♂️
 Of course feedback is very welcome! 🤖

 What kind of projects should I focus on working?

                              <span>This is actually insane how many people are doing this , so after I posted on /INAT in like 10mins I got Two people on discord trying to scam me to pay 200$ -&gt; 250$ for Ai generated art , btw they take zero effort coming up with the images as a portfolio each image with completely different art style and they dont even rename the image they leave the 11efa8adf4d35f69d60261cf676c8a2a type name , and you can just reverse search with google image and they will 90% come up in pinterest (some of them don&#x27;t because they are Ai generated) .
 (a bit of contest they showed me your usual Ai generated looking art, then I asked them for pixl art and they literally just Googled PIXL ART and just sent me the first images that came up ,and one of the even sent me image with the Ai logo on it and he deleted it too fast so I couldn&#x27;t take screenshot )
 So until now it&#x27;s okay but when I started confronting them ,they started to deny and when I pulled up the screenshots of reverse searching they told me that ,no we made them long time ago and when keept denying it .
 eventually they admitted that they used images from pinterest for the pixl art but not the other &quot;Ai generated looking art &quot; and i kept pushing them until they stopped talking to me ,and one of them literally said &quot;If you use my artwork elsewhere, I will report you.&quot; and asked me if I am algerian for some reason which I am , maybe he thought he would scare me or something like that ,And they went to my reddit post and Down voted it to try hurting me or whatever xd .
 Conclusion :
 Those scamers have insane resilience.
 But actually on the serious note, always look out for new made Discord acounts and basically all Ai generated looking art , and of course always reverse search them to make sure

                              <span>Almost 11k layoffs this year alone.
 I&#x27;m a frontend engineer / programmer with 10 years&#x27; experience in Unity, 8+ shipped games, and a few years of unreal 3-5 experience from side projects over the years.
 I was laid off twice last year, and I have not gotten as much as an interview in 6 months of applying since. I can&#x27;t keep going like this, hoping something is going to work out.
 I paid (finally in full) $150,000 for a Software Engineering degree from RIT that did not have 1 class explaining what a server was or teaching us web development (weirdly we had one class Enterprise Architecture class teaching patterns like Join tables with no context for how to write database queries).
 What&#x27;s left of the industry has forced me out. I will never give up gamedev as a hobby, but I need a way to make money. Every software engineering job I can find now is an unrecognizable alphabet soup of technologies, usually requiring senior developers with backend experience.
 What do I do? Where do I start learning to make myself marketable?
 (P.S. giant middle finger to every live service for soaking up every moment and dollar from the players they exploit, driving the success / profitability bar so high that nothing I recognize as a game will have a fair shot of being funded by a major publisher ever again)

 Why did this become the norm for anti-cheats, and why the user mode anti-cheats are not sufficient? Is it the only way for developers to protect their games?

 Key stats: 
 Wishlists: 530
 Impressions: 4,287
 Visits: 1,795
 Bot traffic visits: 877
 Steam overall clickthrough rate: 41.9%

 My game is a point and click adventure, so I’m in pretty niche territory, but I’m fairly pleased with the momentum so far.
 Anyway, after working on assets for a little while, I launched my page with the following (notable) week-one activity:

                              <span>Since I started making games, people around me are creating &quot;Game Ideas&quot; and asking me to implement them. Without any context. Without understanding market, game design and mechanics, scope and cost. It&#x27;s especially irritating because mostly family and friends have that &quot;great ideas&quot; and I can&#x27;t tell them to go away (usually).
 To anyone doing this and not understanding why gamedev usually don&#x27;t pick up your ideas.
 Everyone have &quot;ideas&quot;. I can literally from the top of my head in 1h give you 20 games ideas. 1 idea every 3 minutes. But ideas without full context, are not worth much. It&#x27;s because every idea need days or weeks of actual work to create a design and validate if it&#x27;s a good to make a game from it. With mechanics working together, with story, with scenario, with checking if similar games exist, with validating if mechanics are really working, if they are fun. And most of the time because of details in game design it will turn out &quot;the idea&quot; is not working. If you come to a gamedev with an &quot;idea&quot;, understand that what really gamedev sees is not a solution, but a problem. You are basically asking someone to spend dozens of hours, maybe days or weeks to validate if &quot;the idea&quot; makes sense.
 If you want to cooperate with someone making games, make a full game design instead**.** Do the leg work. Prepare full concept. Check market. Play many games in genre of game from your &quot;idea&quot;. Validate the concept as much as you can. Find assets. Learn what GDD is. If game is story driven - learn how to write. Write short stories first and check with audience your writing. Then write a story for your &quot;idea&quot;. I mean - depending on the game type, spend at least 100-300h of work before you start talking to someone making games. Then be prepared to put another hundreds of hours of working closely with a gamedev.
 Ideas are cheap. 1 &quot;idea&quot; is created in 3 minutes.
 Full concepts are worth much more. But still the biggest cost is in making a game.

                              <span>Say I have a 79x79 matrix and I want to implement something like strassen&#x27;s algorithm. It&#x27;s of course a lot easier to do this when you have a matrix of dimension 2^n, so I could pad this with zeros to make it 128x128 instead. Is there a way to do this simply? What sides does the padding with zeros go on? 
 Also, I am currently using a vector of vectors to store my matrix essentially. Does this make a difference to how I would go about this?

I looked inside the cstdlib code and some other headers it calls within itself but I can&#x27;t find it. Can anyone help me or tell me if it can be done at least ? Google wasn&#x27;t much help either

                              <span>Hi everyone recently i was learning about async function in cpp and have doubt regarding the same.
 How much thread are created here does this program utilized the number of cores of system or everything happening in the same thread that is main ?
 Please help in understanding what is the advantage of using async here.
 #include #include using namespace std; int square(int x) { return x * x; } int main() { future asyncFunction &#x3D; async(&amp;square, 12); for (int i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; 4; i++) { cout &lt;&lt; square(i) &lt;&lt; endl; } // we are blocket at get call until our result has computed int res &#x3D; asyncFunction.get(); cout &lt;&lt; &quot;result is: &quot; &lt;&lt; res &lt;&lt; endl; return 0; }

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;m working on a CPP application which generate some QML code. My software is a TTRPG CharacterSheet editor, where users can design the charactersheet. There is a UI to design it then you can generate the QML code, and the user may want to do some modifications on the generated code (I need the code to be well-indented).
 I&#x27;m looking for any tips or methods to generate this code and replace placeholders with value.
 Currently, I&#x27;m using QString and arg parameters. But I find this solution complex to maintain and the code is kind of ugly.
 One example: The imageField &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;cpp bool QmlGeneratorVisitor::generateImage(FieldController* item) { if(!item) return false;
 QString text(&quot;%4ImageField {//%1\n&quot; &quot;%5&quot; &quot;%4 source: %2.value\n&quot; &quot;%4 color: \&quot;%3\&quot;\n&quot; + getPageManagement(item, m_indenSpace) + &quot;%4 readOnly: %2.readOnly\n&quot; + generatePosition(item) + &quot;%4}\n&quot;); m_out label()) //%1 .arg(getId(item)) .arg(item-&gt;bgColor().name(QColor::HexArgb)) .arg(m_indenSpace) //%4 .arg(m_isTable ? QStringLiteral(&quot;&quot;) : QStringLiteral(&quot;%1 id: _%2\n&quot;).arg(m_indenSpace).arg(getId(item))); return true; 
 } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; %1 -&gt; name of the field %2 -&gt; id of the field %3 -&gt; background color %4 -&gt; indentation space %5 -&gt; generation of the QML id (based on item id)
 Do you have any solution or tips: could be a way to organize or even some libraries…

                              <span>Basically every language I&#x27;ve worked with so far has been ok with dependency management. You need a library, you install that library, you use it. Sometimes there&#x27;s version conflicts and such, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m talking about here. In Python: pip install; in JS: npm install; in Rust: add it to Cargo.toml; Java: POM File. These are what I worked with, and I know there&#x27;s other ways to do it in each one, but still, it&#x27;s basically &quot;hey, I need to use this&quot; &quot;ok&quot;. But with cpp, every single time I&#x27;ve had to deal with some dependency it&#x27;s been a huge effort to try and relearn cmake, or having to go manually after library files, have compilers screaming at me that it can&#x27;t find something that&#x27;s RIGHT THERE. 
 So, what&#x27;s the deal? Is there something I&#x27;m missing here? I really hope so, please let me know how wrong I am.

 I have open-sourced a part of my database that is a superior replacement for &#x60;std::function&#x60;. It is more performant, easier to understand and much more flexible. It has not been heavily tested yet so bug reports are very welcome! Any other form of contribution as well!

snake_case vs CamelCase: Seems everyone agrees on CamelCase for naming structs and classes, but for namespaces, functions/methods, and fields/variables I have seen both and am I bit confused as to which is &quot;best&quot; or most &quot;standard.&quot;
 m_variable vs _variable vs variable: a) When implementing member variables of a class, is there a standard for starting with m_, _, or nothing? b) Should a public member start with uppercase a la C# properties? c) Are the answers the same for structs?
 variable_ptr vs variable: When a variable is a pointer, what is the standard to add _ptr to its name, not add _ptr to its name, or do whatever increases readability the most for that specific code snippet?
 g_variable vs variable: When a variable is global for a file, is it standard to add g_ in front of its name?
 get_/set_variable() vs variable(): When implementing getter and setter functions, is it typically better (or more standard) to include &quot;get&quot; and &quot;set&quot; in the function name or to just write out the name? E.g. get_success_count() vs success_count().

                              <span>Guys I work in project which is built for both MSVC and QNX, now we&#x27;re trying to build with Linux gcc (in WSL). 
 But the issue is, I&#x27;m getting many errors w.r.t. std functions, for example std::find in algorithm. The error is getting fixed with inclusion of header files. 
 Strangely it is getting built well in msvc and qnx compilers, without even include. I want to know how this works?.
 This is mainly c/cpp built with cmake.
 Thank you.

                              <span>I was refactoring my asset code in my engine and noticed that objects were randomly being destroyed and I completely blanked on how ownership, references, and non reference/pointer values work which I think is the issue I&#x27;m running into. I have a global struct with a few containers for each asset type and then a load function for each asset type &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; struct Assets { std::map models; std::map textures; std::map shaders; };
 ShaderProgram loadShader(Assets&amp; assets, const std::string&amp; vertexPath, const std::string&amp; fragmentPath); Model loadModel(Assets&amp; assets, const std::string&amp; filePath); Texture loadTexture(Assets&amp; assets, const char* filePath);
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; These functions hash the filepath (which is the new thing I was trying out) to use as a unique id and then if not already loaded loads it and returns the asset. I believe everything is being copied right now so I&#x27;m not working with the original object which causes them to constantly be deleted and not be rendered on screen so to fix this I just need the maps to store a smart pointer and the load functions return a smart pointer?
 For future reference is there a way to remember this sort of stuff for example whenever an object is needed outside the scope should I be working with pointers?

                              <span>I recently started learning Rust and wanted to share my experience to encourage others who might be hesitant about its perceived difficulty. The notion that Rust is a tough language puts people from even trying, including my past self. This is particularly relevant for those who, like me, have primarily worked with GC&#x27;d languages (I&#x27;ve only ever completed one semester course in C++ and never used it professionally).
 For me, the learning curve for Rust wasn&#x27;t as steep as it was for other programming paradigms I&#x27;ve used extensively, such as logic or pure functional programming. It only took me an evening or two to get somewhat comfortable with Rust, and within a week I was able to finish the book and complete a couple of projects. What made the transition smoother was the excellent &quot;onboard…</span>

 GCP somehow managed to delete a customers account and all their data. Luckily UniSuper had backups on another provider which let them recover after a week of being offline. 620,000 members and $125 billion in funds so not exactly small fish either.

                              <span>Hi so I&#x27;ve seen a lot of posts discussing similar questions about the best CI/CD but what confuses me is that people a lot of times suggest GitLab CI and GitHub Actions, are they meaning that they should change SCM providers as well? Or are they saying they should create a copy of their repository in GitLab/GitHub and pay the costs of two providers just to use the pipeline? Currently I&#x27;m in a team using Jira and Confluence so I think it makes sense for us to go with BitBucket since code review can easily be done in a way that ties to user stories and it is discounted with our other Atlassian products. Why don&#x27;t more people that use Jira use BitBucket? And what is the best option for a company using Jira? Do we copy our BitBucket repo to GitLab, do we use GitLab and use a Jira integration but still not have our code review be able to be tied to user stories, or do we use a CI/CD manager like Jenkins which most people agree is complex to manage? What are other people doing for this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I am wondering how people here manage the existence of additional environments in addition to production - staging, testing, dev environments.
 In my experience these can be heavy compute cost wise and this can also add up maintenance wise. I&#x27;ve in the past merged a few of these environments to reduce maintenance cost.
 How do you work around this?

 HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;40304549
 Excerpt:
  
Choosing colocation for the infrastructure was the right decision for Ahrefs. Reflecting on the past six years, the data centers with our own servers and network cost us $122 million, a figure that would have ballooned to an astronomical $1.1 billion if we had opted for the cheapest AWS cloud offering. Our powerful on-prem servers enable our developers to focus on enhancing our products for clients, rather than getting caught in a never-ending cycle of trying to optimize cloud costs with little hope of success.

                              <span>After a 20+ year career, I was laid off in the spring of 2023 and spent the next 10 months searching for a new job in what was easily the toughest and most unpleasant experience I&#x27;ve ever had. (Clocked in a total of 95 interviews and over 1200 applications before I finally got an offer.)
 Now, roughly 4 months into the new position, our CEO is stepping down to a different role, and our CFO is leaving altogether. The CFO has been in the position for only 7 months.
 Am I right to be paranoid about the company&#x27;s stability, or am I overreacting?

                              <span>I currently work in a customer facing role with a non-technical PM who manages the projects I work on. This PM consistently schedules last minute meetings and meetings scattered throughout the day, making it extremely difficult to get into flow state and get any actual work done. The PM consistently wants to meet AFTER a meeting with the client so that I can help them understand what happened and fill out their status report since they are not technical and don’t understand what is going on. This happens multiple times a week. Projects are now having to be extended, part of which is because of the fact that my time is consistently being wasted in meetings, or meetings to discuss meetings from earlier. I’ve spoken to my manager about this, and my manager supports me managing my own time. What should I do to set the expectation that I will not use half of my week on meetings that are a waste of time?

                              <span>Not sure if this question is quite r/ExperiencedDevs enough, but hoping so since I really would like some input from everyone.
 I&#x27;ve got 7 years of experience and a strong resume. Historically, I&#x27;ve had no problem getting a job quickly. I&#x27;ve been looking for half a year now and nothing. I&#x27;m wondering if the salaries have fallen enough that I need to lower my expectations or if the job market really is just that tight right now. I also do have the slight complication of I&#x27;m trying to find a job that&#x27;s just a smidge out of my current wheelhouse - is that just not an option right now?
 Not looking to vent or anything -- just want some advice from people who have done this recently to put together a plan of action. Don&#x27;t currently have a job, so waiting until the market changes isn&#x27;t an option.
 The real question I&#x27;m asking though -- those of you who have gotten a new job in the last 6 months or so -- What was your prep like? What were the offers like? How is anybody getting new positions right now?

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve had to find a new job, and for the first time in my career it&#x27;s looking like I&#x27;m going to be taking a fairly substantial pay cut. And I&#x27;ve been having very mixed feelings about it.
 I&#x27;m based in the UK/europe, so for American readers just replace the numbers in your brain with a higher equivalent, rather than commenting on the actual numbers. Because the numbers aren&#x27;t the point. Just think of &quot;what you personally consider a high salary&quot;.
 My previous job paid very well. I was making more than £100k + decent benefits, which is something like top 1-2% of UK salaries. And in my head this number was a representation of success. Most people don&#x27;t earn that much so I must be more successful than most people. I&#x27;ve never thought of myself as materialistic but I enjoyed feeling that …</span>

                              <span>I am a senior dev at my company and was pulled onto a project to deliver a more complicated requirement. While doing this, I realised the more junior dev had missed a lot of functionality and requirements in his build. So he was taken off the project and I was assigned to do a non-billable rework.
 For context, I am a Salesforce developer and the project is complex integration. The client insisted we use a 3rd party tool and deliver the project using SSIS packages. I was not involved at the start or in the sales cycle so had no opportunity to argue against this. I have no experience using SSIS packages and neither does anyone in our company. This isn&#x27;t a project we should have taken on. 
 I have been working for a couple of weeks to try to save the project but at this point I don&#x27;t think I can do it. I don&#x27;t have enough knowledge on SSIS packages and the 3rd party software the client wants us to use. I have learned a lot about them but at this point, the skills required to deliver are not ones I have and I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to really learn them. 
 Does anyone else have experiences like this? I pride myself on being able to teach myself and adapt so it doesn&#x27;t feel great to admit I&#x27;m not capable.
 UPDATE: There is some really great advice in this thread and it&#x27;s good to know I am not the only one this has happened to. I took some of the advice here on board and had a meeting with my deliver director and PM lead where I explained the problem and gave some solutions rather than a flat out &quot;I can&#x27;t do this&quot;. These included me taking extra time to learn about SSIS, hiring a contractor or restructuring the project into a more manageable phased approach. Now it is up to them to have the difficult conversation with the customer!

I didn&#x27;t have anyone depending on me and I could get by with low income.
 However, when I came back to Spain, sitting at ~3 YoE and with a brand new bachelor&#x27;s under my belt, I felt I could go for more since some friends of mine with whom I studied at the start of my career were earning a lot with the same experience as me.

 My resume( format got a little bit screwed since I anonymized it)

 Any idea why I am not getting any call backs. When I applied in 2021, my resume was way worse than this yet I got 5 interviews the first week.

                              <span>Whenever I had an experienced technical project lead, things have been incredible. 
 Whenever I’ve had non-technical managers doing their Agile thing, I’ve HATED my life. 
 Technical leads would jump straight into a problem and either unblock us or understand immediately why things are taking so long or why something can’t be done. They are focused on quality, they care about the software and where it is going. Non-technical managers want things done in X amount of time and you need to explain to them like they’re 5 why it hasn’t been done yet. 
 How am I supposed to respect someone and essentially report to them when they know nothing about technology? 
 These are roles to whip the employees to work harder, slaves overlooking other slaves. They’re there to force devs to give themselves deadlines and burn themselves out. 
 Yes, there are also technical managers who aren’t good managers. Imo you need to be both good at management and good at technology, if you’re good at just one of these, you’re automatically not good enough. Your lack in the other area will show up. The definition of a leader, to me, is someone you look up to, who can do at least everything that you do and more. 
 This industry is a bit of a joke, not surprised that people can’t take us seriously when we call ourselves “engineers”. It seems like everyone who knows how to send an email and takes one course can come in and start managing projects. No wonder this industry is flooded and sinking.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I have always found emulators to be very fascinating, and a few months ago I finally took the plunge and decided to write an emulator of my own. The dream is to write an emulator for the NES, but I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with low level programming, so I started with Chip-8, since it is pretty much the &quot;Hello, World&quot; of emulators.
 I just pushed the final commit of my project on GitHub. I would very much like some feedback on it. Even nitpicking is welcome. Anything I can use when I eventually start working on an NES emulator.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m planning to start adding audio rendering into my Gameboy emulator and have a few questions:
  
For some background, my emulator assumes that all devices will be clocked every machine cycle (70224 cycles/frame). So, I&#x27;m using that clock to determine when to generate the next audio sample. Is there a better way to do this?
 Currently I generate an entire frame of audio data and then sending that data to SDL when it renders the video frame (~60 audio frames/sec). But I&#x27;m having issues finding a good sample rate that divisible by the machine cycles. I did find 264 machine cycles/audio sample, which gives 266 audio samples/frame -&gt; 15,960 audio samples/sec. But this doesn&#x27;t seem optimal. Any suggestions on how I could improve this?
  
Edit: Fixed units in 1. from cycles/sec -&gt; cycles/frame

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a gameboy emulator and am passing almost all of Blargg&#x27;s CPU tests. The main exceptions are the two instructions involving signed integer values: ADD SP, e8 and LD HL, SP + e8. In particular, I&#x27;m failing the test when e8 is -1, seemingly due to the flags. The values I get look correct to my understanding, so my understanding must be wrong. Can someone correct me?

                              <span>Having just had a project immediately reject a vulnerability that is clearly visible on their platform - I&#x27;m wondering what my next steps would be?
 I added comments, further proof, and multiple examples - but nothing back from Immunefi.
 They are claiming &quot;Out of Scope&quot; - but it&#x27;s clearly in scope from all the documents provided.
 Where do you go from here?

                              <span>Yesterday I got a mail back from a well known MNC about a application security engineer open position. I was really in need of a job and cybersecurity jobs are actually hard to get here ( everyone except MNCs don&#x27;t spend money into cybersecurity, until something goes bad ) . They told me to bring my laptop. and it&#x27;s a face to face interview . I checked the duties of an application security engineer and it was totally different from what I am . I worked as a VAPT for two years .( Not a reputed company) Did it for experience and for free. My question is should I attend the interview . They did an initial screening and sent me the mail. It&#x27;s a face to face interview so I need to be there with my laptop and it&#x27;s 800km from here . Should I attend it . Idk most the things application engineer do at work . I need help in deciding . Anything more you guys needs to know . You can ask me in comments

 Recently found a admin bypass on a large well known brand of router.
 I have gotten permission to disclose the “bug” but am unsure how to.
 Would it look bad doing it on LinkedIn as skills?

According to my manager, because of some of the work that we have coming up in the near future 1. that senior role that I mentioned got bumped to lead (we already have a lead) and 2. they made a pitch for me but ultimate was denied by my skip because there&#x27;s a &quot;local&quot; candidate in the pipeline.
 All things considered I&#x27;m taking it in stride. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be promoted this soon anyway and this unfortunately lines up with the company direction of moving to more in-office / hybrid. There are a bunch of people that were hired (and still are) remote - seniors / leads / principals / managers / directors - one of whom is my manager. Most people still don&#x27;t go into the office except on rare occasions like vertical get togethers where remote folks fly in too.
 I really enjoy working for the company that I do, so the game plan for now is just to keep kicking butt and make myself undeniable for promo. Looking elsewhere for a lead / staff job has crossed my mind, but I have an agreement with myself that I&#x27;ll wait until 5 years before doing that (currently sitting at 3 and some change at my current level). Moving back to where the company is based out of has also crossed my mind - I used to live there, but moved back to my home state to be closer to family during the pandemic.
 I&#x27;m curious - have y&#x27;all run into similar situations? How have you handled it? Also, I have a 1 on 1 with my skip level in a month who denied my promo. Any tips? They&#x27;re new to me because of a re-org, so it&#x27;ll be the first time we&#x27;ve met. I&#x27;ve known of them for a while.

                              <span>Management asked me and 3 other colleagues to conduct interviews for a senior position, and we planned together how to conduct the interviews. 
 My second interviewee was referred by one of my colleagues, and I conducted this interview with a more senior developer but due to time constraints I was only able to change a couple questions from my list and the candidate mostly did very well on the ones I didn&#x27;t change but failed on the ones I changed. The more senior guy asked him about the same questions he uses to ask, and he did ok except on the different questions. Just after the interview we discussed the candidate, and agreed there were some suspicious bits and &quot;red flags&quot; but he objectively passed so we filled in the form with our appraisal and sent to HR.

                              <span>I have gotten pretty saturated at my current role (50 person startup) and I don&#x27;t see any growth path internally. I have already expressed my concerns to my manager many times in the last 1 year, but these discussions have gone nowhere. 
 I have monthly 1:1 with my manager and everytime he wants to know whether I&#x27;m liking my work. Now so far I have followed a policy of being as transparent as possible at work. So the next time he asks me this, I&#x27;m thinking of telling him that I will be looking for opportunities outside since I can&#x27;t see any opportunities within the company.
 So far, I&#x27;ve had a pretty transparent relationship with my manager (who is also the CTO btw). Do you think telling him that I&#x27;m looking for opportunities outside the company can brutally backfire ? I dont have any offers in hand and I may be at the company for a significant amount of time.

                              <span>For context, I lead a team of 8 people in a large company (more than 10k employees). My manager was out on vacation for 2 weeks and before she returned, I went on vacation for 2 weeks. So there’s an overlap of 1 week where we were both on vacation. Both vacation times were planned a month or two ago. 
 There are a couple of key initiatives for our company that my team is working on, and I’ve notified in an email about who to reach out to in my absence, while copying the respective individuals. My automated out of office response also mentions these individuals.
 My team was merged under her a few months ago and she doesn’t have a lot of understanding of our product/service. 
 She returned this week and has been reaching out to me via text asking me to look at my Teams chat/email and provide updates on various topics which she needs to pass on to her boss and a couple of other key stakeholders. I understand her situation and indulged her the other day, but now this is becoming an every day thing.
 How do I be supportive of her situation while also not rubbing her the wrong way? Given the market situation, I don’t want to be fired for sounding rude when asking them not to bother me during my time off.

                              <span>I am working as a lead. All my team mates are at least 10 years junior to me. They respect me and I am driving this team. I also get approached frequently for technical issues they face. 
 But I find it hard to mix with them like I can with colleagues my age. They also tend to be serious in front of me and rarely invite me for tea breaks or unofficial lunches they plan.
 My personality is not at all dominating. (In appraisal review, I keep getting comments that I should be more assertive.) I am little introvert but I still try to lighten the environment and for a moment we are good but then after few minutes everything goes back to earlier stage.
 My concern is this will slowly cut me off from the team especially in future when they will not need my help in solving technical issues.
 Has anyone faced such issues? Is there anything I can do about this or should I just accept this and not worry about it?
 Edit: I am the lead and not a manager. It&#x27;s not an official position. But I am supposed to lead the team because of domain and product knowledge.

I have started using a website called cplusplus.com, it’s been extremely helpful but It feels like it’s not enough.. I read, implement what I have read, but when I try to do it by myself the knowledge is just not there anymore. any tips?

                              <span>Hello, I need help in converting the Devanagari letter अ to its integer representation. In python, I can easily use the ord() function to convert it to its decimal representation For example:
 ch &#x3D; &#x27;अ&#x27; print(ord(ch)) //Outputs 2309, which is the decimal conversion of its Unicode representation, 0905 
 Also the .encode() function to convert it into its Unicode representation
 ch &#x3D; &#x27;अ&#x27; 
 unicode_rep &#x3D; ch.encode(&#x27;ascii&#x27;, &quot;backslashreplace&quot;) print(unicode_rep) //Outputs b&#x27;\u0905 of type byte
 However, when I try the static_cast function in C++ it throws a warning:
 int main(){ char ch &#x3D; &#x27;अ&#x27;; int i &#x3D; static_cast(ch); cout &lt;&lt; i; 
 }
 The output:
 unicode.cpp:7:15: warning: multi-character character constant [-Wmultichar] 7 | char ch &#x3D; &#x27;αñm; | ^~~ 
 unicode.cpp: In function &#x27;int main()&#x27;: unicode.cpp:7:15: warning: overflow in conversion from &#x27;int&#x27; to &#x27;char&#x27; changes value from &#x27;14722181&#x27; to &#x27;-123&#x27; [-Woverflow]
 -123
 What can I do?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m a scientific programmer. I primarily use Python and FORTRAN. I have to write a code that involves solving a finite difference equation on multidimensional vector array. 
 (1) Defining a multidimensional array: The array is electric field with three components (ex, ey, ez) defined at (Nx, Ny, Nz) grid. Where Nx, Ny and Nz are the number of points along X, Y and Z. So if Nx, Ny, and Nz &#x3D; 10, 9, 8 my array will be [10, 9, 8, 3] shape. 
 Then I have to define gradient along all the three axes and solve some numerical equations which involves matrix multiplications. 
 I have done this in Python and it was straight forward using Numpy Ndarrays. 
 I recently tried porting my code to C++. I realised that defining multidimensional arrays in C++ is not so straightforward. 
 What is the fastest and easiest method to implement such a multidimensional array in c++? 
 Any advice is helpful.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m working on a chat application and I used RSA to encrypt messages but now I need to use AES since the data became larger. From what I know AES doesn&#x27;t use private/public key pairs so I guess I&#x27;ll send it to the clients encrypted using RSA. Are there any examples using AES with large data?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I wrote a blog post about a small C++ library I recently wrote called raptor. I thought I&#x27;d share it here for anyone interested: https://dma-neves.github.io/dma/raptor.html
 Raptor offers similar performance and capabilities to thrust, but offers a more abstract interface. Raptor provides a set of smart containers (vector, array, vector, scalar) and skeletons (map, reduce, scan, filter, sort) that can be applied over the smart containers. Containers can store the data both on the host (CPU) and device (GPU), and expose a seemingly unified memory address space. Skeletons are executed on the device. Containers are automatically and lazily allocated and synchronized whenever a skeleton is executed.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an engineer, not a real programmer. I took a course in &#x27;high performance computing&#x27; once. The teacher was a mathematician, but he seemed to me very knowledgeable in the area of programming also. He taught us that it was convenient not to name iterators with only one letter. I found this good advice myself, so i usually name iterators &#x27;ix&#x27; instead of &#x27;i&#x27;, and so on. Why have I never seen this convention anywhere else?

 I had a similar problem with only the  header, but after updating GCC, this applies to all standard headers. Is anyone else experiencing the same issue? Is this due to a conflict between GCC and Clang (libstdc++ versus libc++, perhaps)?
 Edit: Apparently, passing &#x60;-D_Float32&#x3D;float&#x60; to clang-tidy supresses those errors.

                              <span>I&#x27;m aware that std::string is preferred over char*, but is it always the case? For example,
 auto str &#x3D; &quot;Hello world&quot;; 
 &quot;str&quot; type will be a char*, unless we explicitly mention that it&#x27;s a std::string. So I&#x27;m bit confused here the use cases and if there&#x27;s any downside (in performance) when using std::string over char* (especially for bytes that are will not be modified later).

 I do like Python, but I miss the types. As for TS. . . It&#x27;s really not even close as using something like CPP or Java. Writing JS/TS classes feels like weenie hut jr. compared to classes in CPP. 
 I hope to work with CPP eventually but I can tell it&#x27;ll be a while.

 In my member functions, some of them return type &#x27;Vector&#x27;. However, i did not specify the parameters for the return type. Thus instead of simply
 template 
 Vector Vector::operator + (Vector v2) const
 I must declare it as:
 template 
 Vector Vector::operator + (Vector v2) const
 I was using a &quot;concrete&quot; return type &#x27;Vector&#x27;, but this type is parameterized, hence why the compiler complains, it doesnt know what parameter to use for the return type. 
 Here is my header file &quot;Vector.h&quot;
 #ifndef VECTOR_H #define VECTOR_H #include  #include  #define PI 3.14159265 #define RadConv PI/180.0; #define DegConv 180.0/PI; template  class Vector { private: type x1; type x2; type x3; bool Is3dVector; public: Vector(t…</span>

 For example, if I have two classes moving things in two different ways, each could have it&#x27;s own generator:
 class Trace { 
 std::mt19937 gen{std::random_device{}()};
 std::uniform_real_distribution dist{ 0.0, 1.0 }; 
 // other stuff including an update method using these
 };
 class Seek { 
 std::mt19937 gen{std::random_device{}()};
 std::uniform_real_distribution dist{ -1.0, 1.0 }; 
 // other stuff including an update method using these
 }; 
 What approaches do people take? What are the pros and cons? How do you test your code?

                              <span>I have never used threading before, but I would like to learn. I have a program in C++ which generates small crossword boards and it&#x27;s quite calculation heavy. It&#x27;s a backtracking algorithm so basically it explores one path, backtracks, tries another, backtracks, etc. Therefore I could see the benefit of exploring multiple paths at the same time, using threading.
 However in practice I don&#x27;t really know how much threading would speed things up. Threading is used for I/O operations involving waiting, but there&#x27;s no waiting involved here, so would it even be useful? Furthermore, how many threads could I get away with creating? I couldn&#x27;t tell you if 10 or 100 is a good number of threads for one program.

                              <span>I know the definition of “senior developer” may vary company to company and so on but, according to your definition of senior developer;
  
Which skills should a senior developer have?
 What would you suggest to a junior/mid developer for their seniority journey?
  
I am working as an embedded software developer (C++, Yocto, etc). I would be happy if you add additional info about embedded industry.

                              <span>So it is fully possible to use #define with parenthesis to, for instance, make a an add &quot;function&quot; like this:
 #define ADD(x, y) ((x) + (y)) void foo() { std::cout &lt;&lt; ADD(3, 7) &lt;&lt; std::endl; } 
 My first question here, is this good or bad C++ practice? I&#x27;ve heard that &quot;macros are evil&quot; but don&#x27;t fully understand why or what it even means.
 On the the real question of the post, is it possible to use #define with curly brackets? I might give some of you a heart attack now so let&#x27;s just view this as an example. Is it possible to do something like this:
 #define private_namespace{a} namespace{a} private_namespace{ void some_function() {...} int some_other_function() {...} } 
 In this case you might say &quot;Why not just write #define private_namespace namespace?&quot; to which my answer is a) this is more of a hypothetical question for learning purposes and b) then the coder could write private_namespace some_namespace {...} instead of namespace some_namespace {...}.

                              <span>My problem is that while writing my name and roll number or any other string with spaces into the file as a single variable, it writes it incorrectly and therefore my search function and other functions don&#x27;t work. For example, if I enter Rehan Amir as my name, it will save Rehan in the name variable but not Amir, it will store that in roll no variable for some reason. I tried searching on how to fix this but couldn&#x27;t find a solution. Tried using cin and such but didn&#x27;t work.
 void Admin::addStudent() { string name, rollno, department, semester; cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter name: &quot;; getline(cin, name); cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter rollno: &quot;; getline(cin, rollno); cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter department: &quot;; getline(cin, department); cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter semester: &quot;; getline(cin, semester); ofstream file(&quot;student.txt&quot;, ios::app); file &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; rollno &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; department &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; semester &lt;&lt; endl; cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Student added successfully!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; } void Admin::searchStudent() { string rollno; cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter rollno: &quot;; getline(cin, rollno); ifstream file(&quot;student.txt&quot;); string line; string name, roll, department, semester; bool found &#x3D; false; while (getline(file, line) &amp;&amp; !found) { name &#x3D; line.substr(0, line.find(&#x27; &#x27;)); line &#x3D; line.substr(line.find(&#x27; &#x27;) + 1); roll &#x3D; line.substr(0, line.find(&#x27; &#x27;)); line &#x3D; line.substr(line.find(&#x27; &#x27;) + 1); department &#x3D; line.substr(0, line.find(&#x27; &#x27;)); line &#x3D; line.substr(line.find(&#x27; &#x27;) + 1); semester &#x3D; line; if (roll &#x3D;&#x3D; rollno) { cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Name: &quot; &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; endl; cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Rollno: &quot; &lt;&lt; roll &lt;&lt; endl; cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Department: &quot; &lt;&lt; department &lt;&lt; endl; cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Semester: &quot; &lt;&lt; semester &lt;&lt; endl; found &#x3D; true; break; } } if (!found) { cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Invalid rollno!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; } }

                              <span>ctreg (pronounced cuh-tredge) is a library for compile-time regular expressions the way they were always meant to be: at compile time! It&#x27;s a macro that takes a regular expression and produces two things:
  
A type containing the compiled internal representation of the regular expression, or as close as we can get given the tools available to us. This means no runtime errors and faster regex object construction.
 A type containing all of the named capture groups in the expression, and a captures method that infallibly captures them. Unconditional capture groups are always present when a match is found, while optional or alternated groups appear as Option. This is a significant ergonomic improvmenet over fallibly accessing groups by string or integer key at runtime.
  
Interestingly, we currently don&#x27;t do any shenanigans with OnceLock or anything similar. That was my original intention, but because the macro can&#x27;t offer anything meaningful over doing it yourself, we&#x27;ve elected to adopt the principles of zero-cost abstractions for now and have callers opt-in to whatever object management pattern makes the most sense for their use case. In the future I might add this if I can find a good, clean pattern for it.
 This version is 1.0, but I still have plenty of stuff I want to add. My current priority is reaching approximate feature pairity with the regex crates: useful cargo features for tuning performance and unicode behavior, and a more comprehensive API for variations on find operations.

 I wanted to leave in large part because I felt my boss and my team didn&#x27;t really respect me. My boss explicitly told me no one on the team likes me. I basically became entirely disattached from work and kinda started disliking my teammates because the environment felt extremely hostile
 A few days later, we had a meeting that was optional where we discuss tech. I tend not to attend them because they&#x27;re either not talking about something relevant to me in any way, or if it&#x27;s frontend, I figure they probably don&#x27;t want to hear from me (goes back to &quot;the team not liking me&quot;). Today it was on figma. My boss angrily messaged me asking why I wasn&#x27;t there since I&#x27;m the &quot;figma expert&quot;. I am not a figma expert.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never had a career nor a degree, and have always held menial data entry -type jobs. I like computers and programming so I thought I&#x27;d try for a CS degree thinking that would be a good job going into the future... Except now I keep seeing things about how AI is going to make a lot of entry level programming jobs obsolete - probably the same jobs I would be applying to once my degree of finished. So did I choose poorly? I am mainly interested in programming and cyber security. Will be job outlooks be poor in the near the future? Should I pivot to something else?

 I’m 27, veteran, family, house, the whole 9. 
 An opportunity came up where I qualified for something where my schooling, any certs, software, tech stuff, are all paid for I just have to request and prove why I would need it. 
 Knowing that, is there anything you can think of I should make sure I acquire while I don’t have to foot the bill, and can prove it might be necessary to my post degree career? 
 Thanks in advance! 
 Edit: Also if anyone could recommend some high tier and mid tier laptops for school, thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 I’ve been working on my next project, &quot;Planetaries,&quot; an open-world sci-fi TD survival game. You’re probably wondering what the TD part is all about. Well, it’s a significant aspect of the game where you defend your base and earn Tech Points to unlock new technology in your tech tree. However, it’s not a necessity; you can choose to farm your own way, explore, or complete contracts to obtain technology. The game also supports multiplayer.
 Teaser:
 In the teaser footage, I’m showcasing some of the environments, gathering mechanics, alien life, points of interest, combat, player base interactions, character movement, overall feel, and theme of the game.
 Feedback:
 I’d like to hear your thoughts on all these aspects, including the graphics.
 Development Teaser [on the Steam page]:
 https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800450/Planetaries/
 Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you.

 Though if the hubris does overwhelm, pick an easier game genre, Something one person can do, no matter how brilliant you think you are, you really are not. Still it could of been worse I could of chosen a MMORPGGGGGH
 Don&#x27;t make a major gameplay change midway (I done 2 on this game adventure, turn based -&gt; realtime &amp; dungeons -&gt; Open World). Lesson learnt, If the game ain&#x27;t happening, scrap it and start something new, don&#x27;t try to shoehorn what you have into this cause it will bite you in the ass later 
 Don&#x27;t roll your own code. i.e re-invent the wheel, Sure this is oldhat advice. But take it from an oldfart, dont. I went from my own engine in c++/opengl &amp; my own physics engine -&gt; my engine + ODE -&gt; Unity &amp; C#. I wasn&#x27;t cool rolling my own, I was just a dick wasting hours, hours that could of been useful realizing my dream 
  
Positive advice:
  
Only 2 rules in programming
 #1 KISS - Always keep it simple, you may think you&#x27;re smart doing some shortcut or elegant solution, but 50% of the time you&#x27;re creating problems down the track, why roll the dice, play it smart. OK this is a mantra but #2 is not well known
 #2 Treat everything as equal. AKA - don&#x27;t make exceptions, no matter how much sense they appear to make, inevitably it will bite you in the ass later
 Now I still violate both the rules even now (after 40 years of programming) So this is do as I say, not as I do thing
 Don&#x27;t be afraid to go out of your comfort zone. Myself, In the last couple of years, I&#x27;ve (with my GF) had my child, something I swear I would never do (It happened though) &amp; gone to help in Ukraine. Both totally unrelated BTW

                              <span>Idk I wouldn&#x27;t even consider myself a developer. I&#x27;ve only released mods for existing games, and am only about 5% done with my first &quot;original&quot; game. Sometimes I&#x27;ll have inspiration or ideas for something then think of a game I love and think &quot;Wow I&#x27;ll never be able to make something that good.&quot; or &quot;What is the point if anything I make is just a worse version of an existing game?&quot; and I know that&#x27;s partially my various mental issues talking, but idk sometimes I just take a hit to my motivation when I think about that, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not alone. Just curious how others feel about stuff like that? 
 Then again the fact I&#x27;ve made any step towards achieving my dreams before I hit 20 is probably a miracle...

                              <span>I played around dissembling memov and memcpy and found out intresting stuff.
 1. with -Os they are both the same and they use &quot;rep movsd&quot; as the main way to do things.
 2. if you dont include the headers you actually get materially different assembly. it wont inline those function calls and considering they are like 2 istructions thats a major loss
 3. you can actually get quite far with essentially guessing what the implementation should be. they are actually about what I would expect like I seen movsd and thought &quot;i bet you can memov with that&quot; turns out I was right

                              <span>Hey Folks!
 I am starting off with C as my first ever programming language. (I have some prior programming experience with C and Python but never managed to go pass the basics. Hopefully I will get to a point where I can do something useful with these languages around this time)
 Nonetheless, I am following the classic &quot;The C Programming Language&quot; by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. In the introductory chapter (A TUTORIAL INTRODUCTION - Page 6), the first example to print Hello World goes something like this:
 # include  main () { printf(&quot;Hello, world\n&quot;); } 
 When I compiled it with the cc or gcc compiler, an error was produced:
 error: return type defaults to &#x27;int&#x27; 
 Naturally, I went back to the thought process that I had in my previous attempts at learning C. I simply declared the return type for the main() function to be void and it compiled successfully. The changed code goes like this:
 # include  void main () { printf(&quot;Hello, world\n&quot;); } 
 What am I missing out from the example? Has it something to do with the Compiler Version that I am on? Or is it something entirely different?

I have too many questions though, so any suggestions are welcome. Thank you all, I&#x27;m already learning a lot thanks to this sub.

                              <span>Heya, how can I prevent the repeated keypresses that happen when a key is held down? All I want is for 
 int c &#x3D; &#x27;\0&#x27;; If (read(0, &amp;c, 1) !&#x3D; -1 ) { printf(&quot;%c\r\n&quot;, c); } 
 To only print the character when it is pressed and when it is released, or alternatively print constantly when being held down. My terminal is in raw mode, and this is all in a while loop obviously. Thanks in advance. I don&#x27;t have access to curses/ncurses. Just C standard library and administrator privileges XD

 In this program, while trying to print a[7] which should be out of bound, it prints the value that was initialized above it. Do anyone know what is happening??
 Also when initializing two variables, i and j, and trying to print a[7] and a[8], both will print 0 on my VS code, but prints values of j and i respectively. On an online compiler, the output changes each time it is run.

                              <span>Take neofetch for example. When we run it prints the ASCII logo left hand side, and the information right hand side. I want to do that in C but I&#x27;m not sure how exactly.
 If I read the ASCII logo from a file, and if I try to read it line by line, and print it (left-side) alongside the information (right-side) I think it&#x27;s possible in that way, but it would be very inefficient. Any ideas how to do it in C? An example would be very nice!
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am learning C from Ritchie&#x27;s book (released in 1988) and in the third example in his book, the temperature converter program from fahrenheit degrees to celsius does not work. It is cycled indefinitely at a first line. I am curious as to why this is, because it&#x27;s odd that someone who developed C would write bogus program in the guide to learn it. I am editing in Visual studio code and GCC compiler and have all the updates installed for C/C++ libraries.
 This is the code I wrote exactly as is in the book:
 #include  main() { int fahr, celsius; int lower, upper, step; lower &#x3D; 0; upper &#x3D; 300; step &#x3D; 20; fahr &#x3D; lower; while (fahr &lt;&#x3D; upper) { celsius &#x3D; 5 * (fahr - 32) / 9; printf(&quot;%d\t%d\n&quot;, fahr, celsius); fahr, fahr + step; } }

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I’ve recently started taking the Nand2Tetris course. I am currently in week 6 of the first course, which deals mainly with hardware.
 This week though, it is required to build an assembler, which is the first software above the hardware. The course teachers say it can be built with any programming language, like Java and Python.
 The thing is, right now I am mostly familiar with C, but I am also not an expert. I’ve programmed in Python on the past, but I will need to refresh, as I have used C more lately.
 But should I build the assembler, and maybe the next required software (I think it is a VM and a compiler), with C? Like isn’t it too complicated because of all the memory management you have to consider, no classes (as opposed to C++) etc.?
 Also, if you’re familiar with this course, I would like to consult with you if you think I should proceed to the second part? Or take CS50x before, which I have heard is very good for starting out with programming? Is Nand2Tetris part 2 recommended in general?
 Thanks in advance.

 it works like this:
 int x &#x3D; 3; match(x, (gt(20), printf(&quot;greater than 20!&quot;)), (lte(50), printf(&quot;lower than 50!&quot;)), (true, printf(&quot;NEITHER&quot;)), ); 
 and can be used in expression like:
 int y &#x3D; match_exp(x, (in_range(5,10), 7), (gt(5), 5), (PAT &lt; 20, 4), (true, 1), );

Structure, union and enumeration types may be defined more than once in the same scope with the same contents and the same tag; if such types are defined with the same contents and the same tag in different scopes, the types are compatible.
  
Which means GCC now lets you do this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;c
 include 
 define Resultt(T, E) struct Result##T##_##E { bool is_ok; union { T value; E error; }; }
 define Ok(T, E) (struct Result##T####E){ .is_ok &#x3D; true, .value &#x3D; (T) _OK_IMPL
 define OK_IMPL(...) __VA_ARGS_ }
 define Err(T, E) (struct Result##T####E){ .is_ok &#x3D; false, .error &#x3D; (E) _ERR_IMPL
 define ERR_IMPL(...) __VA_ARGS_ }
 typedef const char *ErrorMessage_t;
 Result_t(int, ErrorMessage_t) my_func(int i) { if (i &#x3D;&#x3D; 42) return Ok(int, ErrorMessage_t)(100); else return Err(int, ErrorMessage_t)(&quot;Cannot do the thing&quot;); }
 int main() { Result_t(int, ErrorMessage_t) x &#x3D; my_func(42);
 if (x.is_ok) { printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, x.value); } else { printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, x.error); } 
 } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

 We can now have template-like structures in C!

                              <span>Anyone have any recommendations on how to make DevOps/development work less consuming? I currently work as a staff level engineer and do some dev work for some interesting OSS projects on my spare time.
 Recently after taking a 2w vacation without much work going on (bless Asia’s cable cuts for creating a 300ms+ latency back to Europe) I realize how much of my life has really been consumed by just dev work instead of doing other things that I want like hiking etc. Sometimes it’s just a bug or something I’m too focused on and end up spending a lot of time on, or some new feature that I’m building…
 Anyone else have this issue or have any advice about it?

                              <span>Hi Yall, 
 I&#x27;m curious on your opinions on the right relationship between fullstack developers and sre when it comes to ownership of load balancing and security services (authorization, EDR, etc.)?
 In this case our fullstack team owns development of a customer facing product which includes our SAAS API and various front ends. The API is composed of micro-services. It does biz logic things like user management, fetching results, ingesting media inputs and passing them into our core engine which is owned by MLEs... 
 We are a small startup, I am the first and only devops engineer at the moment. I initially wrote authorization and owned load balancing into the system but out of feeling that I was spread too thin I passed this ownership off to the fullstack team. My sense over the past few months is that the fullstack team shouldn&#x27;t ideally own load balancing and authorization, they tend to do things really quickly and dirtily and I suppose I&#x27;m not fully comfortable with their approach. My sense is that this should be owned by security minded SREs who are already responsible for production.
 Can you guys assist in providing insight into my potential blindspots? What are your thoughts?
 Thanks!

 Most interesting is how file structure, partitioning and layer interaction is organized.

                              <span>Would Golang be a good choice as a primary language for a mid size SaaS startup?
 It would consist of a back office and public facing website that serves data managed in the back office.
 It would not have any performance critical parts, such as realtime computing, concurent actions or server to server communication.
 My major concern with golang would be speed of development cycle and how well would it behave in a startup environvment with ever changing requirements?
 Another thing would be how easy or costly would it be to find good Golang talent with limited budget of a startup?

                              <span>As I&#x27;ve understood, the main purpose of c++20 modules is to speed up compilation without the need to separate declarations and definitions.
 But by &quot;merging&quot; the .cpp and .h files in a single module file, that file will contain all the imports / includes, which will increase the chance of circular dependencies.
 I know that we can still use forward declarations with modules, but now we would be required to not only forward declare a class, but also its methods that we want to use.
 What&#x27;s the best way to avoid this issue when using modules?

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m pretty new to C++, and am trying to create a custom free() function that takes data from a used linked list and moves it to a free LL. It correctly works when the data being removed from the Used LL encompasses the entirety of the list, but not so much when the data is only partial. The malloc() function works with partial data, so I&#x27;m confused. I am using a 32-bit integer with two flags at the front to store the data, one that determines the type and one that determines if there&#x27;s data above it. I&#x27;ve placed both functions below, and need help. Thank you!
 void *Mem::malloc( const uint32_t _size ) { Used* pUsed &#x3D; nullptr; //search free list for block &gt;&#x3D; input size assert(this-&gt;poHeap !&#x3D; nullptr); Free* pFree &#x3D; this-&gt;poHeap-&gt;pFreeHead; while (pFree !&#x3D; nullptr) { //traverse list …</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m pretty new to cpp and am trying to work out the best design for a problem I&#x27;m having. I&#x27;m wondering if shared pointers are the way to go. 
 The problem: I have a class that makes an expensive database query during construction. The information retrieved is static though and most of the class functions don&#x27;t even depend on the data. Furthermore, a class instance might be constructed multiple times during a single call from the upstream application , and each time this expensive and often unnecessary db call is made.
 My idea: Lazy load the db query only when it&#x27;s first needed and then store the data in a global cache that will exist for the entirety of the application call. I can&#x27;t control if 10 instances of this class are created, but I can limit to a single db call instead of 10. 
 Is a shared pointer amongst the class instances a feasible and a solution here? My understanding is that the a shared pointer to the cache will keep it alive as I need, but I&#x27;m unsure how to pass a pointer between the instances like this. I&#x27;m also wondering if I&#x27;m overthinking the problem and there is a simpler solution I&#x27;m not considering. I&#x27;d appreciate any advice or insight, thanks!

                              <span>Looking into using BCrypt.h for various crypto stuff. MSDN indicates the following for BCryptOpenAlgorithmProvider:
  
Because of the number and type of operations that are required to find, load, and initialize an algorithm provider, the BCryptOpenAlgorithmProvider function is a relatively time intensive function. Because of this, we recommend that you cache any algorithm provider handles that you will use more than once, rather than opening and closing the algorithm providers over and over.
  
This implies to me that you can globally initialize the algorithm handle and reuse it throughout your application in all threads. But since MSDN doesn&#x27;t say anything about it, I&#x27;m not sure whether that&#x27;s true or if the handle caching guidance applies per thread.
 Can anyone shed some light on this?

                              <span>As mentioned in the title, for some reason, every time I re-open Visual Studio Code, I have to delete my project&#x27;s build folder and clean and rebuild. If I don&#x27;t, I get a black screen and the game locks up eventually.
 After deleting the build folder, clean and rebuilding, the issue never happens again until I re-open VS Code.
 I&#x27;m currently using the latest version of Visual Studio Code alongside the following extensions:
  
CMake by twxs
 CMake Tools by ms-vscode
 CodeLLDB by vadimcn
 C/C++ Intellisense, debugging, and code browsing
  
Btw, OpenAL-Soft was added to my engine project which is a library my game includes.
 I&#x27;m running:
  
Latest version of VSCode
 Compiler: Clang 17.0.6
 OS: Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4
 OpenGL 4.2
 Windowing: GLFW
 Also using GLAD.
  
I could just delete and rebuild everything every every morning, but doing this would mean rebuilding my entire project. Has this every happened to you?
 Any tips or recommendations are greatly appreciated.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Many c++ open source projects are header only because building and installing is the hard part - rather then needing to be. Theres excellent resources for using CMake yourself but less so for shipping your library with CMake.
 This how-to explains why testing is important and how you can implement CI. This is a great thing to contribute back to the projects you use!

                              <span>Hello everyone, I understand that this issue is really complex and probably involves something terribly wrong somewhere else in the code, but I&#x27;m seriously stuck and hoping someone can shed some light on this.
 I&#x27;m using Ubuntu 22.04, with Clang++.
 Ubuntu clang version 14.0.0-1ubuntu1.1 Target: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu Thread model: posix InstalledDir: /usr/bin 
 This code should have no visible effects whatsoever:
 std::thread([]() { for(;;); }).detach(); 
 And yet, if I place it anywhere in my code, it either segfaults, double-calls functions that are only called once, throws an exception from some unexpected destructor (as if it&#x27;s exiting the nested scope when it isn&#x27;t), etc.
 One example of where I tried this, while trying to isolate the problem, is here:
 // static void test() // { // for…</span>
                            </span>

 Technically this is C but the C sub is often uncooperative. Will also post there, but answers here are always faster
 Here’s what I mean

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m on the hunt for a linear algebra library that implements the upcoming std::linalg standard from C++26 (details here). Given that the standard will likely not be widely supported by compilers until around 2030, I&#x27;m interested in using a library that aligns with std::linalg now. This would allow for a seamless transition to std::linalg once it becomes broadly available. 
 So far, I haven’t found a library that meets these criteria. I did come across this post, but it wasn’t quite what I needed. If anyone knows of a library that fits this description, I would really appreciate your recommendations.
 Additionally, if anyone is aware of a wrapper for any established libraries like Eigen, Armadillo, BLAS, LAPACK, xtensor, or Blaze that adapts their functionality to align with the proposed std::linalg standard in C++26, I’d be very interested in learning about it. Such a wrapper would ideally allow for easier migration to std::linalg when it becomes standard. Please share any leads or resources you might have.
 Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>Hello everyone.
 I’m relatively new to C++ and have a project im working on. The basis of the project is a basketball game where randomized players and their stats are generated through a draft system then stored into multiple text files. 
 I have correlated the players and their attributes using array positions. I have the system set up correctly where I can write the data to the text file and read from it but I am unable to run the code unless I manually go and delete the info from the text file. Only when I do this do the errors disappear.
 It defeats the point if the players stats are not able to be retrieved the first time they were drafted in the game, as I want to be able to implement a save feature where you can pick up where you left off. I have implemented this by creating a main menu, with a switch function, allowing a player to either reset their data by truncating the text files, and undergo the draft process all over again, or continue with the information already in the text file. The issue is however, as I said before, I cannot run this without deleting the data in the file, which I do not want the player to have to do unless they want to reset the game.
 The errors themselves are 2 C2059 errors and Expected a Declaration in the text file themself, which confused me.

 I&#x27;ve worked in two different codebases so far, and like many other C++ devs I find myself frustrated and almost a little insecure inside about how little I know about these features.

 I was just wondering has anyone looked into/watched this https://youtu.be/-TkoO8Z07hI?si&#x3D;rtK_l1g4SlIwgauw to get started with cpp? I was going to start using it but didn’t know if it would be good to use, only for the fact it seems to be beginner level which is good, but doesn’t give you an idea what to do after to keep growing your skills and knowledge. I’ve heard learncpp is good so should I just do that? Any advice is welcomed. Thank you.

                              <span>I am new to c++, mainly a Typescript dev.
 In TS, I can return union types where it can be either &#x60;this&#x60; or &#x60;that&#x60;:
 // Typescript function - union return. function cheese(a: string): false | string { if (a.length &lt; 2) { return false; } return a; } 
 In this trivial example, I can return a false OR a string.
 How can I achieve the same thing in C++? It&#x27;s okay if the whole pattern needs to be different, but I want to be able to return different types from a function... if possible.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I was working with the Au units library (https://github.com/aurora-opensource/au) again recently and I really like it. If you work with physical units in your code, you should check it out (and watch the CppCon videos). I really like it&#x27;s design philosophy. Shout out to Chip Hogg and other contributors--nice work!

 Not necessarily for hacking (I wasn&#x27;t sure where else to ask this), it could be a tool for audio, networking, hacking, communication, etc, usually found for like $100 or less, but not always. Just trying to find out if there is a name for this style of device that I can search for to find more just for learning/research...thanks!

                              <span>Hello dear brothers and sisters,
 After having a very harsh life, an opportunity has finally presented itself and I decided to get my CCNA certification earlier this year (on my first try). However, it is still extremely difficult to get my life back on track. As a matter of fact, months are quietly passing by and nobody has called me about a job interview, not even once.
 Of course, that couldn&#x27;t stop me from being curious about technology (and networking in particular), so I have moved on and continued with acquiring new skills on my own. My next stop was Kali linux (which I love very deeply) and pretty soon I got obsessed with network penetration. Over the course of time I have continued to learn about most important tools and techniques through books, whitepapers and official documenta…</span>

 Here with the clock variables commented out I get my expected answers of 12345 and 12360.
 But when these variables are not commented out I get a variety of answers that also increment for some reason:

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty good at programming in C for a Linux computer but I am interested to learn how it differs when programming for an embedded device.
 I had a couple of questions that I had trouble finding answers for on Google and was hoping someone could help me understand.
  
In Linux, GCC compiles my c code into an elf file which can then be loaded into memory when executed. Is there a similar process like this for embedded devices? For example, can GCC generate binaries that are flashed onto embedded devices, or do each embedded device have its own compiler?
 
Since Linux syscalls generally don&#x27;t exist on embedded devices, what c functions can I use when programming for embedded? I&#x27;m assuming that glibc wouldn&#x27;t be available and printf doesn&#x27;t exist but do utility header files such as stdint.h still exists?
 
 Thanks

 I’m in the process of writing a software in C which has the following features:
  
A Touchscreen GUI which displays realtime data about a “remote device” and allows sending commands to it.
 A network part which handles the communication with that remote device via ethernet
 A hardware part which handles communication with a custom pcb with encoders, leds and buttons
  
The software runs on a Raspberry, the “remote device” is connected via ethernet and the local hardware via serial. 
 Basically the software should perform the following operations: 
  
Check for incoming ethernet data, if so update parameters of remote device which are stored in a struct (basically a local copy of all of the remote unit parameters). The remote unit constantly sends it’s parameters at roughl…</span>

 the input is:

 4 1 1
 4 5 -1
 5 6 -1
 1 6 1

 4 6
 the output ends up being:
 1
 -9
 -1
 -1
 The graph contains a negative cycle
 But it should be:
 1
 -9
 The graph contains a negative cycle
 -1
 -2
 I don&#x27;t know why or how to solve this problem, could someone help?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I want to build a GCC cross compiler for the tricore target architecture that runs on a windows host. I could do this directly on Windows using some environment like MSYS2 or w64devkit.
 I was wondering, since MinGW GCC is also available on Linux, can I build the cross-compiler such as host&#x3D;x86_64-w64-mingw32, build&#x3D;x86_64-linux-gnu and target&#x3D;tricore? Basically building a cross-compiler using a cross-compiler..
 I know it sounds silly, but would be really helpful since our CI runs on Linux and I want to automate the process. Sorry if it&#x27;s not the proper subreddit for such questions!

                              <span>Hi all, I am learning multithreading for a little sideproject. Right now, before implementing anything I&#x27;m trying to learn the fundamentals of threads and how they work in C. I made a really simple program to see how efficiency differs with threads and... it&#x27;s twice slower (?) 
 At first I was using a unique buffer but I then read that it&#x27;s better for threads to access separate memory locations so i made 3 different buffers, one for each thread, Here&#x27;s my code and a little explanation. Feel free to destroy me if I misunderstood something, I&#x27;m trying to learn so every tip is appreciated. 
 ​
 Code explanation: I created a simple struct containing a dinamic array of int, which size will be allocated accordingly in the main function, and a file pointer where values will be printed.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;m a relative beginner to C, my goal is to write a web server on Linux myself without looking it up, or without looking up examples online at least, I feel like I would just end up copying it and I want to go about it properly. I think it would massively boost my coding skills as well as help me understand web servers better. 
 I&#x27;m curious what your process is for doing this, or what process do you recommend? As far as I understand, the main way to &quot;look up how to use something&quot; like sockets is to use man pages, and do you just reference those and keep looking at whatever you don&#x27;t understand for the next thing and next thing to etc.? I feel like I have about 50 terminal tabs open because I&#x27;m down the rabbit hole of reading man pages, not complaining because I&#x27;ve found out some super interesting stuff, it just doesn&#x27;t feel super efficient. 
 Let me know if that&#x27;s just what we do or if you have some other method, I get there&#x27;s obviously books as well. I&#x27;m a bit sick of tutorials and learn how to code sites, especially when I know the basics reasonably well and just want to get onto building something. 
 Cheers!

 I dont use cmake so some of the things i say may be wrong, but i believe when you run &quot;mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make&quot; this will ignore files from this library that are in the tools/ directory. Is there a way to add those aswell to be build also?

I got in an argument with my friend and he told me that I was lazy and begging for a job, I have been trying for 6 months with one company that wants me but can&#x27;t give me an offer yet because no project. all I have done is network and apply to positions and fix my resume. Nor really getting interviews. Is this because my github is lacking commits or because my resume isn&#x27;t right and I am not talking to the right people or is it a combination of both?

 What&#x27;s the best way get technical? Associates in CS? Bachelors? There&#x27;s no way I qualify for a Masters program. Get a job related certification and fill in the gaps as I go?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been interviewing quite a few people recently for a remote role and noticed most don&#x27;t bother turning on their camera. It&#x27;s a bit awkward but I decided to keep mine on anyway.
 Is this very common in your experience?
 I assume they might do it for bias reasons (definitely had women not wanting to get judged because of their appearance and I get that from what I&#x27;ve seen in our field) or just don&#x27;t feel like it. I didn&#x27;t push for it as I generally tend to have my team decide by themselves if they turn their camera on during meetings and glad to do as much as possible in Slack. But for a first time meeting people I still find it super hard to... bond with them and then later tell them apart. Or even hire someone without ever having seen their face once.
 Last time I interviewed people for my team a few years ago I didn&#x27;t notice this, most just seemed to turn on the cam without having it explicitly stated.
 EDIT: 
 For the next rounds I&#x27;ll definitely see that I explicitly state &quot;video call&quot;. I was just surprised people don&#x27;t do this by default but perhaps I&#x27;m just becoming boomer :). But there&#x27;s a &quot;give a talk and we discuss&quot; round anyway, so I hope at least there they&#x27;ll turn their cam on.
 I should probably add, this is for a very senior/scientific role, so we also have to meet customers at least virtually, pitch projects, give talks, hold webinars, perhaps go to a conference etc.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a software dev with 6 years experience, I love my current role. 6 figures, wfh, and an amazing team with the most relaxed boss of all time, but I wanted to test the job market out so I started applying for a few jobs ranging from 80 - 200k, I could not get a single one. 
 This seems so odd, even entry roles I was flat out denied, let alone the higher up ones. 
 Now I&#x27;m not mad cause I already have a role, but is the market this bad? have we hit the point where CS is beyond oversaturated? my only worry is the big salaries are only going to diminish as people get more and more desperate taking less money just to have anything. 
 This really sucks, and worries me.
 Edit: Guys this was not some peer reviewed research experiment, just a quick test. A few things.
  
I am a U.S. Citizen
 I did only apply for work from home jobs which are ultra competitive and would skew the data. 
  
This was more of a discussion to see what the community had to say, nothing more.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve heard a lot that going from IC to management is a path that, in tech especially, is seen as a somewhat lateral move - and that good ICs don&#x27;t always make good managers.
 What have you seen in your experience drives that? Are there common pitfalls and mistakes that you&#x27;ve seen ICs who&#x27;ve become managers make that affects their ability to be managers?

                              <span>I have been interviewed about 100 times and interviewed about 40 times. For me knowing if the person had side projects is maybe the most important question since it showed me the person enjoyed what they do and are interested in learning and getting things done. I would estimate about 15% did which I always thought was really low.
 When I goto interviews now I try to let them know I made some small apps and iPhone games and have a github they can check out. I really am hoping that will put me in the front of the pack.
 I know some people say coding is just a job and you don&#x27;t NEED to enjoy it but when you have 2 people working together who both find what they do interesting I think it can make the job alot more enjoyable.

                              <span>My boss, the tech lead who at one point was the sole developer on the team, keeps handing over his half-assed / half-completed projects to me. 
 He&#x27;ll do 30-40% of the work, write zero documentation, and then will tell me to finish it without giving me any context. 
 My boss is the kind of guy who has trouble delegating tasks on a product that&#x27;s his &quot;baby&quot; and really wants to keep his hands in everything that happens.
 I get that as a senior developer it&#x27;s my job to work on complicated things, but it takes me twice as long just to understand the code he wrote as actually finishing the project. It also makes me feel like an idiot when I have to ask him a hundred questions about what he&#x27;s already done + why he made particular choices (which are often not well-thought-out). He also often takes a long time to respond (since he&#x27;s busy working on 5000 other tasks) leaving me confused and frustrated.
 Better yet, if I end up taking a long time to understand what he&#x27;s done / finish the solution, he&#x27;ll get impatient and then will try to finish it himself. 
 This jobs has a lot of perks and I&#x27;m generally left alone most of the time (which is great), but I&#x27;m getting pretty demoralized.

                              <span>I joined this large global company in 2016. It was pretty good back then. Autonomous teams with great developers building great products. My country was very profitable. 
 2018 it is decided that most development work in my country would be moved to India. Our senior developers would now work as architects, product owners and team leads. Most of our great developers decided to jump the ship. I decided to stick around.
 2018-2020 is a disaster. Everything falls apart. Its so bad that there is a new decision to switch back to 100% inhouse development.
 2021, its hard to recruit great developers and we need to recruit a lot of people. Management and HR is not happy with the progress, too many candidates fail the technical interviews, its taking too long to sign new employees. It is decided that there will be no technical interviews from now on, HR will handle 100% of the recruitment process. Focus on &quot;soft values and skills&quot;.
 2022, it is still a disaster. We have signed a lot of new emoloyees, most with wrong skillsets due to HR having no clue about what we need. We needed senior software developers and we got database admins, sysadmins, service desk agents etc that wanted to get into software development. 
 2024, we are still in a very bad state, and guess what? The solution is to move development to India again. The history repeats. 
 I should obviously jump the ship, i used to be a developer, now i just spend my time in crisis meetings, escalations, red alerts, meetings with management etc. However i find this mess to be very entertaining. I always enjoy going to work to find out what madness is going on today. Its like a great tv show, i cant wait for the next episode.
 Has anyone been in a similar situation? Enjoying a terrible place to work at? What did you do?

                              <span>Title. God this is driving me insane. We have an application, FooCRUD, that has an extensive bootrunning process that takes ~15 mins. I&#x27;m trying to debug some changes that I&#x27;m making, which involve interplay between the frontend and backend. I keep on waiting those 15 minutes and then seeing, okay, this issue still isn&#x27;t fixed, or now FooCRUD is failing because I imported FooVisual version 4.6.1 instead of 4.6.0, or I forgot a &quot;)&quot; somewhere, and now I have to bootrun again. This story is running way over the allotted hours and I am super embarrassed right now.
 Is &quot;we should make our applications easier to ****ing test&quot; a thing you can agitate for? Obviously actually doing that is going to take a lot of developer time, which a team lead may not be able to justify to stakeholders. Is it a design principle that good devs care about, and if so does it have a name and is there any literature on this?
 Maybe this is a junior-level question and I should&#x27;ve figured out a generalizable approach years ago. Idk I just wanted to vent. I&#x27;ve dealt with similar things before with e.g. debugging SQL stored procedures or big data pipelines. 5 YOE mid here

                              <span>I&#x27;ve worked in front-end web dev before, although 95% of my experience is in systems, machine learning, and gamedev as a hobby in c++, java, c#, python etc. I&#x27;ve definitely had an interest in doing web development and I have worked in a small team before to do a simple web app, but I found that the process was absolutely agonizing. 
 ​
 Specifically, javascript seems to take my least favorite aspects of all the languages I know, and puts them together in one singular package seemingly designed from the ground up to make development as frustrating as humanely possible. 
 ​
 I&#x27;m learning rust now but I consider myself a beginner still, and even though I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m quite past the initial growing pains with getting used to it, I am enjoying it and I&#x27;m all for trying out literally any alternative in existence to using javascript again. 
 ​
 So as someone who knows nothing about it beyond skimming through the first page of google, do any of you actively use rust for front end? What&#x27;s the current limitations? I can imagine countless benefits to using it over javascript, but are there any drawbacks to using rust for it over javascript? 
 ​
 I know absolutely nothing about it, and my web dev knowledge overall is extremely rusty and likely outdated. But are you somehow working with frameworks like react but with rust? Or bindings? CSS? Any sort of generalized idea of how it works, what the experience is like and maybe some pointers on good resources for getting started would be really appreciated

                              <span>Hi. I want to write my own NES &quot;cartridge decoder&quot; that will serve as a helper tool during development of my NES emulator. One of it&#x27;s capabilities will be dissasembly of a PRG ROM. However the thing with these ROMs is that data is mixed up with the code and it can look roughly like this:
 
 
 
  
 And etc. So if you are looking at compiled binary you really have no way of telling whether given byte is treated as instruction, instruction operand (or part of it) or data used by the program.
 I came up with 2 approaches how I could tackle this:
  
Lazy approach - Just interpret everything as instruction (of course by taking their variable length into account)
 Better approach - Interpret the program, not exactly by executing it but going instruction by instruction, tracking where it jumps or which subroutines it calls. While processing branch instructions process both cases. Read interrupt vectors and interpret them as well until reaching RTS instruction. Everything else would be considered raw data and dead code would also fall into that category. Basically disassembler would go instruction by instruction to determine where code execution can lead to distinguish instructions from the data.
  
I never specifically wrote a dissasembler, so I would like to know if my ideas are at least good, or there are better, more reliable approaches to that out there.

                              <span>Hi All, I&#x27;m working on implementing the serial port in my Gameboy emulator. I&#x27;m trying to understand how the serial port hardware interacts with the system clock. From the documentation I&#x27;ve found online, it seem like the serial port derives its clock from the system clock directly, instead of through the timer DIV, like the audio hardware:
 Cycle-Accurate Game Boy Docs, Section 6
 Does this mean that even when the serial port is not enabled (via SC bit-7) this counter is increasing? What happens when the serial port is enabled? Does the counter reset to 0?

I’m sure people have figured out a way to automate this, I’ve found dependabot and renovatebot, but wondering what people use and how they use it to find a good solution

                              <span>I looked at the prospect of jobs as code with control-m back in 2021, and was overwhelmed by the Automation API and determined that for us, octopus run books can cover our use cases for now, since most could be done with a combination of SQL and PowerShell.
 Granted control m is kinda silo’d at our organization so we don’t have great automation support. 
 Octopus isn’t really compared to competitors of control-m, so I feel like I’m missing something. Can anyone straighten me out?
 Thanks

                              <span>The build stage is taking so long (with a timeout set to 1 hour, often reached…)
 package.json contain a lot of caret and tilde ranges which will lead to inconsistent build stage duration since the command ‘npm install’ will always try to fetch the latest version of a package, and if not found it will download it…
 the use of an npm registry did not fix the issue since the process will be highly dependent on the net bandwith the Gitlab runner .
  
What I have been thinking of so far:
  
Use ‘npm ci’ instead of ‘npm install’ basing on a package-lock.json. This method required the manual update of the npm lock file, or maybe with the help of third-party tools/extensions such as Renovate through the scheduling of an update process
 Configure cache on a separate disk? (Not sure about this approach and how it could help me in this case)
  
I posted here in order to get more insights about the matter.

 OneUptime has Uptime Monitoring, Logs Management, Status Pages, Tracing, On Call Software, Incident Management and more all under one platform.
 Updates:
 - Several new monitor options launched - You can now monitor your SSL Certificates and Servers (Processes running, Mem, CPU, Dick, etc)
 - Evaluate monitor metrics over time. You can set up alerts for things like - &quot;Create an incident when my website response time is &gt;5 seconds for 5 minutes&quot;. This wasn&#x27;t possible before.
 - Added Logs ingestion with fluentd and OpenTelemetry. Traces and Metrics ingestion with OpenTele…</span>

 I fullfill myself with music, back then played a lot of guitar but 5 years ago I switch to alto saxophone and and I try to make some electronic experiments as well - https://www.instagram.com/klimat.wav
 Aparat from that, together with my gf we plan to go to carpentry course this fall - serious one it lasts 3 semestrs (1.5 years on weekends).
 Yep, no kids :))
 Hopefully this thread is fine with the rules!

 So, my story began one year ago when I started making [Graveyard Gunslingers]
 Concept:
 &quot;Graveyard Gunslingers&quot; is a 3D survivors-like bullet hell game set in Wild West. You&#x27;re given 10 nights to survive. During the day, gameplay is kind of chill. You mine resources, explore, and manage your skills preparing for the night. At night, you shoot down hordes of zombies.
 The main twist in the game is its day-night cycle. The goal of this mechanic is to keep the player in a state of flow. During the day, the gameplay is relaxed, allowing the player to focus on harvesting resources and managi…</span>

For those of you working for AAA companies (or even III for that matter), what path(s) did you take to get there? Advice for someone trying to break in? Also I understand that right now isn’t necessarily the best time in terms of hiring vs layoffs, but I’m trying to play the long game here. Also, what does it realistically look like to work for a AAA company? Anyway, not looking for anything specific. Just wanting to hear from other industry professionals.

                              <span>Hello fellow game devs,
 I was wondering if anyone might be able to share some insight into what went wrong with my latest release? It&#x27;s been a week so far and the sales are not ideal to say the least. I&#x27;m genuinely interested in learning from this since I&#x27;m at a loss.
 I tried to make a unique, fun, challenging, and non-linear detective game and was really excited about it. Essentially the more you play, the more the story comes through and the pieces fit together.
 Here are some highlights of everything I&#x27;ve done leading up to release:
  
3 years of effort with 2 years of full time dev working on this game. Invested $1k into hiring proper voice actors.
 2 years ago participated in a Steam Next Fest to gather wishlists.
 2 years ago participated in a local Expo to see how players reacted …</span>

                              <span>Hello, fellow Gophers!
 I&#x27;m new to Go, transitioning from Python where I extensively used Django and FastAPI to build backends. In the Python world, I was used to riding on the shoulders of giants. Python frameworks usually provide built-in tools for authentication—everything from password validation and encryption to token expiration and third-party logins.
 Now, as I start developing my first API with Go Chi1, I&#x27;ve noticed the prevalent advice is to implement features from scratch. This shift has left me anxious about potential missteps and the risk of creating an insecure application.
 Do you all build auth from scratch when using Go Chi, or are there trusted libraries you rely on? How do you manage the complexity and ensure security? 
 1 Choosing Chi over the many other &quot;expressive, lightweight, API router&quot; was already a tough dilemma (and still I don&#x27;t know if I chose the right tool). I first started out with Fiber until someone told me &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t because it doesn&#x27;t use one of standard lib&quot; though, to be honest, I didn&#x27;t really understand the reasoning.

 nb-crdt-go: (Go)
 nbfm: (Go + Wails + nb-editor) alpha version file manager
  
I built nbfm to demonstrate a serverless collaborative notion-level note editor only using shared files. All the work is done alone, so the quality may not be perfect and may not be that great.
 But it holds the potential to become an all-in-one workspace where users have full data sovereignty. I strongly believe it is valuable in the era of A.I.

 repo
 This is a proof of concept/Prototype
 Almost a year ago, I started working on a GDScript compiler. And then stopped because getting GDExtensions to work (even in C) was a pain (because it&#x27;s not documented). This was my first time using rust, so the code was kinda bad. 
 I have revisited the project, but it&#x27;s a bit different now. Instead of using LLVM to generate machine code, I generate rust, because if I can use rust I will (even for shaders). 
 And with help of gdext, I won&#x27;t have to deal with GDExtensions.
 Benchmarks
 The rust version (without optimizations) can run 5 times faster in this case nth Fibonacci number.
  GDScript: 390 ms Rust: 77 ms 
 (Code for the benchmark can be seen in addon/bench.gd)
 Features
  
Function
 Calling functions in the same file
 Math
 for loops
 while loops
 if
 variables
 Addon
 maybe I missed something else
  
Limitations
  
Using other Nodes.
 calling function outside the file
 Can generate wrong rust code
 And a lot more
  
FAQ
 Why rust?
 I like it.
 Will this make normal GDScript obsolete?
 No, GDScript is really nice to debug. And fast to iterate.
 Why is GDScript slow?
 IMO, I think the main problem is loops, it&#x27;s something that any interpreted language fears.
 Why not make a JIT?
 While it will be better for dynamically typed language like GDScript, but it will be harder to implement. Oh, and JIT&#x27;s won&#x27;t work on IOS.
 Why not use rust or c++ direly
 Debug in Godot, run with rust. GDScript is easy to debug for normal people, for compiled languages you need to use lldb or gdb.
 Future
  
beg Godot devs for --script-dump-ast
 Better codegen (this that takes AST and makes rust source code)
 Improve the add-on.
  
I won&#x27;t be working on this for some time. Writing a parser is only fun the first time, not 2 times + other failed attempts with parser generators. Basically, nothing will be done until --script-dump-ast, and then maybe I will continue.
 Maybe this will revive this issue.

                              <span>A lot of reddit subs used to do that back in the day. I&#x27;m not sure why they died out, maybe it was a programming fad.
 I can&#x27;t help feeling it might be a good fit for the Godot community though. It allows more experienced devs to flex their muscles and show off, while more novice level people can take notes.
 I&#x27;m not talking about long challenges, such as making games/prototypes, but more specific stuff. 
 Here&#x27;s an example of Python challenges for comparison. That list goes from beginner level to hard, but there&#x27;s no reason we have to vary the difficulty by that much.

                              <span>Ok, hear me out, we can all have opinions on Zig-the-language (which I haven&#x27;t touched in months) but this isn&#x27;t about Zig-the-language, it&#x27;s the C compiler that comes embedded with Zig-the-toolchain: zig cc. If you ever had to cross-compile some C the traditional way, you know how painful it is. With zig cc it&#x27;s literally just a single flag away, -target $TRIPLE. That&#x27;s it. With QEMU user mode and WINE I can easily test my code for Windows and obscurer architectures all within a few minutes in a single terminal session. I don&#x27;t need to wonder whether my code works on 32-bit big-endian PowerPC or on i386 Windows because I can just check. It just feels like a better frontend to clang, imo.
 (Plus, zig cc also has nicer defaults, like a more debugger-friendly UBSan being enabled by default)

                              <span>Hello, I’m taking system programming course this semester and the final exam is a project presentation and I have no idea what to do. In class we are writing a multithreaded C++ code and we test it in windows wsl. Sometimes we use terminal commands in Linux(Ubuntu) for testing as well. The project should focus on multithreading, GPROF, GDB, time (in terminal), top and htop, iostat, vmstat, mpstat, sar: automated neparting, valgrind, perf, unit tests, and mutex. I submitted a proposal about encryption and image processing but both are occupied by other students and were rejected and I have one last chance for project proposal and I have no idea what should I do. Anyone have ideas other than the one’s that got rejected? The proposal should answer 3 questions (What, Why, How)

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently working on implementing Conway&#x27;s Game of Life in the terminal using C++, and I&#x27;ve encountered a challenge that has me stumped.
 As I dive into building the two-dimensional grid required for the game, I&#x27;m faced with a dilemma: should I use a 2-D array or vectors? My goal is to create a grid that can dynamically change its size during runtime, which rules out arrays due to their fixed size. After some research, I&#x27;ve learned that vectors in C++ offer the flexibility I need, allowing me to resize them on the fly.
 Despite dedicating hours to this endeavor, I&#x27;m finding the process of dynamically resizing the grid using vectors to be quite daunting. Specifically, I&#x27;m struggling to increase the size of the grid by (rows+2) x (columns+2) when certain conditions are met.
 If there&#x27;s anyone proficient in C++ who has experience with dynamic resizing of 2-D vectors, I would greatly appreciate any guidance, tips, or code snippets you could share to help me overcome this obstacle. Your assistance would be invaluable in bringing my Game of Life project to life!
 Thank you all in advance for your support and expertise.
 Thank YOU!

                              <span>Hello, ive been reading about poll and epoll and i think i dont really get why epoll is faster than poll, here is my current high level understanding:
 Poll: loops over a list of provided fds, calling a is_ready() fn and updating another list with the fds which is_ready() call returns true
 Epoll: registers all provided fds into a epoll fd, which on new events will wake up epoll_wait(), tho i dont know how does the event triggering works? i read on some high level explanation that its a dedicated thread that loops over the fds, so equiv to poll but it wouldnt make sense - then on new event, a list of ready fds is returned and the wait update its structure with the ready fds, user then just have to iterate over this list of ready fds
 i dont know if its clear, i hope so.
 man epoll() says this: 
 By contrast, when used as a level-triggered interface (the
 default, when EPOLLET is not specified), epoll is simply a faster
 , and can be used wherever the latter is used since it
 shares the same semantics.poll(2)
 I would like to know if my understanding of how poll detects ready fd is good, and how does epoll listen / triggers on new events, as well as why is level triggered epoll is faster than poll even if it seems to me that on level triggered mode epoll does the same as poll (iterates over fds and check if ready)
 thanks in advance for the help

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;m working with an STM32G070CB microcontroller and facing an issue where the USART2 interrupt isn&#x27;t being triggered after populating the TDR with the first byte. Despite configuring the USART with FIFO enabled and setting up the correct NVIC priorities, the data isn&#x27;t being transmitted, and the ISR isn&#x27;t called. I&#x27;ve checked the usual suspects like global interrupts, USART initialization, and error flags, but the problem persists. Here&#x27;s a brief overview of my setup: FIFO is enabled for USART2. NVIC is configured with the correct priority for USART2 interrupts. Global interrupts are enabled. USART2 is initialized with the correct settings (baud rate, word length, etc.). Hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) is enabled.

                              <span>Hi. Some time ago I was working on a python-like _Generic type-aware C11 printing library. The library is called YIO and the source is here https://gitlab.com/Kamcuk/yio . I have not been working on it for quite some time.
 My questions are: Do you see yourself using such a library if it is &quot;stable&quot; and working? Do you think it is worth spending time improving it?
 The library became my playground to discover a lot of stuff and there a lot of features. UTF-8 support, wide char, UTF-16 and UTF-32 support with libunistring, _Decimal printing, stdfix.h printing, struct tm formatting, full python format specifier support, monetary printing support, configurable multiple ways of printing floating point numbers - using strfromd or RYU library or my own implementation of floating point printing, …</span>

 dpointer[0] &#x3D; &quot;two&quot;;
 *dpointer &#x3D; &quot;three&quot;;
 In the above snippet of code, I get a segfault on the last two lines, both of them. Why?
 If I assign a string value to a regular pointer, no segfault takes place. So why does it happen when I do it with a double pointer?

                              <span>Legacy product, certain parts of it have a lot of test debt. The business risk from this test debt was raised by engineering, multiple multiple times. 
 There&#x27;s always a new priority that takes precedence over existing instability.
 
 One of the inadequately tested components had an issue that was indeterministic and discovered in prod. Not that we would&#x27;ve caught it even if it was deterministic, there is no/very little coverage for this.
  
But ___this___ time, it had enough visibility that leaders had to explain why this issue made it to prod.
 Rather than explain that this is a known issue and should&#x27;ve been/should be prioritized, I get pulled into the meeting and got the finger pointed at me
 I want to say something in my 1:1, essentially a professional version of &quot;wtf&quot; but the most possible outcome seems to be some form of retaliation from mgmt chain
 Should I be offended or am I overreacting? Is this common practice for upper mgmt and I should just roll with the punch?

                              <span>I was at 2 companies in the past 7 years.
 First company was bigtech. I kinda just cruised. I would ask for work, and literally my manager would be like *shrug. I never got any projects... never got any tasks... I literally did nothing for 2.5 years but simple bash scripts here and there.
 So I quit and joined another company. I got a bit more work here, more projects, etc. I was able to get a team of 2 junior engineers, we worked on projects here and there
 I didn&#x27;t &quot;grow&quot; because I was always the most senior.... I had nobody to get guidance or advice from.
 Whenever we built new projects, I basically &quot;architected&quot; it and built it with the team... but... it was 99.9% me teaching them stuff. I never really learned much I feel.
 Even simple basic things like... code standards, I just did what I felt like was the best. For our software design patterns, I used GoF stuff I learned from reading, where it SEEMED like it would be good, but I had no guidance or feedback! I architected a distributed system when we finally got a bigger project and while it worked and scaled, I have no idea if I did it &quot;right&quot;...
 Now that I&#x27;m laid off, and looking for a new job... I feel like a serious imposter during my interviews. A) I &quot;architected&quot; and &quot;standardized code on the team&quot; but... it was a team 3 and it feels like bullshit and I don&#x27;t really know anything. and B) When I get asked about design patterns... sure I &quot;know&quot; the patterns but... I have about as much experience APPLYING them as a newgrad....
 I feel like my 7 YOE knowledge is LESS than a 2YOE who worked on a big team with a senior engineer advising them

                              <span>We have this senior dev join us last year. Soon after they joined we learned that they overengineer and overcomplicate absolutely everything. They pushes back on every feedback they gets in the PRs with very very long responses, links to resources, etc. 
 We decided to let them work on a new initiative, so they could take their time to understand our process since there wasn’t a hard deadline on it. The project has become a deviant and a one-off where they didn’t follow any of the patterns we used on any of the other services. Basically you tell them, we need to do C and to get there we need to build A and B. He then goes and builds E, F, G, H and then finally C. You tell him that that’s not how we usually do things, and then they asks you to write the requirements for it, and they will make sure that C matches those requirements… I don’t think anyone else on the team would be able to contribute to this project or support it, which is almost like a legacy service being brand new.
 They don’t get involved in any of the other tasks the rest of the team does, but constantly requires time from everyone to review their PRs. They also started getting very involved with other teams organizing lunch and learns, presentations, discussions and trying to get buy-in from other teams in how they do things.
 This individual is a very smart person and I don’t doubt his technical skills.. but is really a pain to work with him. He seem to be very obsessed with the processes shared with other teams instead of anything related to us. I don’t know if he is trying to set himself up for a promotion or what, but it is becoming exhausting

                              <span>I can step through the logic but after attempting that on multiple occasions it seems like what is most persuasive is if other teams/people/companies are doing it. Are there published statistics or articles that make the case for things like standard scrums or anything of that sort?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve only been here for under a year but basically we had layoffs a few days ago. Anyways we had a big company wide meeting the same day and someone asked if there would be more layoffs and the guy basically said &quot;I definitely can&#x27;t promise there won&#x27;t be but I can say for the life of the company wether that&#x27;s 5, 10, 20, 100 years from now we will have many many more&quot;. 
 I also learned from some of my coworkers who have been here for 3 years that they&#x27;ve had layoffs every year. 
 The layoffs were not due to performance. They are always simply operational cost things aka your team is costing more than value so bye. 
 Idk it&#x27;s just so icky. I feel like I need to really work hard to avoid getting laid off. Like my job is always at risk and any day I might wake up and oh I got laid off lol. I get business is business but it&#x27;s just really fucking icky. 
 I really liked this job but now I&#x27;m just icked tf out.

                              <span>I have been working about 10 years at larger tech companies and joined my first startup (a late stage one) several months ago as a Staff dev.
 When I was interviewing they had told me that I would receive X # of options at some strike price and so I negotiated heavily for more options in my package. Little did I know, they were about to announce a funding round, invalidating the previous strike price and the strike price that I would receive has tripled (which I have not yet been granted). Sure I still get X # options however they are now at 3x the strike price. This means that instead of paying say $200k to exercise my options I have to pay $600k if I ever want to exercise (with the risk that it becomes potentially be worthless if it never IPOs).
 Given that I don&#x27;t see the company realistically going IPO until at least 5+ years, this means if I leave before then I will have to either shell out a large amount of money or just leave my stake on the table. If I just leave it on the table then it only makes financial sense for me to stay at the company the amount of time equal to the amount of options I am willing to exercise.
 Has anyone else joined in the middle of a raise unknowingly and are there other solutions? Has anyone tried to renegotiate their offer package after joining since grants haven&#x27;t been issued?

You can also generalize some of your answers (e.g. &quot;Biotech company&quot; or &quot;Hideously Overvalued Unicorn&quot;), or add fields if you feel something is particularly relevant.

                              <span>How much is too much? Is writing down the deployment process for each project we manage to much when all the deployment processes are the same? We have 2 Devops guys, myself being one and the other one who know the deployment process and its rather simple. Is there a need to document every single thing? Trying to find the balance of just enough documentation without over documenting things when i know it may not be really referenced. 
 What is your take on internal documentation for your team - at least when it comes to reference things. Do you also have documentation which is used to help developers whenever they get stuck an issue?

                              <span>It took me a while to figure out how to fully get the most out of kubectl (mainly combining it with useful plugins and complimentary k8s tooling) Since none of this was intuitive when I started learning to interface with k8s clusters through kubectl I wrote up a summary of what I have learned so far. Hopefully it might be useful to others.

 I&#x27;m a rather new IT architect with a software development background of 10 years.
 I work for a university and when I joined, we had one young devops guy who maintained all our stuff, we have a docker swarm and he knew docker well, git well and linux well. 
 Our 3 in-house devs only wrote code, they knew very little about Docker and this one devops guy managed everything after the devs pushed their code. 
 We then hired one more, they were both quite decent and covered everything and when I joined, I had a lot to learn and to do so I didn&#x27;t have time to get into that topic.
 But then they both left and we hired 2 new ones. They were also not the most experienced, but had about 5 years of experience and seemed smart and interested and knew linux etc. 
 And both have been solving th…</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1clp9x7/removed_my_linkedin_profile_picture_now/">

                              <span>So recently I decided I was going to replace my LinkedIn profile pic since my current one is outdated. While I hadn&#x27;t yet replaced it I left it blank and suddenly received 2 unsolicited messages from recruiters and 2 responses from other job listings in the span of 1 week. For context, I had spent 6 months and ~800 job apps which I know isn&#x27;t that many but I haven&#x27;t even gotten a phone screen. My last and only interview was 6 months ago, where I made it to the final round and was rejected because they had an applicant with more experience than me (I had over 2 YOE and it was a junior role FML). 
 Anyway I&#x27;m starting to question the timing of these recruiter messages. I don&#x27;t think there was anything wrong with my profile picture. The only critique I could think of is that it was a bit outdated so I might have looked too young. I don&#x27;t really want this to turn into a r/RoastMe post so just bear with me and assume I am just an average looking person. 
 I think the more likely scenario is that there is some algorithm that LinkedIn uses that detects when users become less engaged on the platform and then decides to rapidly promote that user into reengaging again. This may come across as tinfoil hatty but I do think this is the most likely outcome since the timing does not make any sense and I haven&#x27;t read anything to suggest the job market suddenly improved a ton. I am curious if other people have had similar things happen to them like this.
 Also an FYI I am a White Male U.S. Citizen with 2.5 YOE in a popular tech stack in a west coast city.

                              <span>I have an internship coming up and I’m trying to schedule a flight a month from now right after work hours, but the most convenient time for me is 6pm which is an hour after work and it takes me an hour to get to the airport, so I’m thinking of asking to leave an hour before the end of the day. Would this be a red flag or is this common and ok to do at an internship? I have my managers contact information but afraid asking for time off before I even started is a red flag.

                              <span>When I started getting interested in programming, I got sucked in by the Rust hype and decided to learn it as my first language. I am currently on chapter 15 on the book, and I think I have a good understanding of the stuff I read up to that point. However, when I try to program anything real, I get very overwhelmed and can&#x27;t seem to figure things out. I feel as if the libraries I see are either too abstracted to teach me anything about Rust itself, and I have to learn about the library. Or, things are complicated and I see crazy patterns that take me a long time to figure out. What projects can I write to teach me fundamentals?

                              <span>I&#x27;m hoping that I&#x27;m doing something wrong because creating new mocks in existing code really sucks.
  
create interface for your struct (already really damn tedious)
 refactor code so that the mocked struct is now passed into your unit either through argument or through parent struct (this can be miserable)
 find the previous mockgen command, append the new mock to it, run (surely there is a better way)
  
Also is there no way to mock a function that is not a method? Or what if a function call is hardcoded into the unit you are trying to test. What would you do then?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am looking for a free IDE that would allow me to debug golang code. I used GoLand when EAP was available but they removed this possibility now (not a criticism, just stating the fact they did). I found that useful especially for running in debug
 Emphasis on free as is for my personal machine. I have a work machine and have a full intellij license but seldom use go at work (one of the motivation to do personal projects and set up my personal machine)
 My personal machine runs linux if relevant

                              <span>Sometimes I see the following scenario:
 Playtester: The movement feels very stiff.
 Dev: Oh yeah that&#x27;s intentional because this game was inspired by Resident Evil 1.
 Your playtester is giving you honest feedback. The best thing to do is take notes. You know who isn&#x27;t going to care about the &quot;design&quot; excuse? The person who leaves a negative review on Steam complaining about the same issues. The best outcome is that your playtester comes to that conclusion themselves.
 Playtester: &quot;The movement feels very stiff, but those restrictions make the moment-to-moment gameplay more intense. Kind of reminds me of Resident Evil 1, actually.&quot;
 That&#x27;s not to say you should take every piece of feedback to heart. Absolutely not. If you truly believe clunky movement is part of the experience and you can&#x27;t do without it, then you&#x27;ll just have to accept that the game&#x27;s not for everyone.
 The best feedback is given when you don&#x27;t tell your playtester what to think or feel about what they&#x27;re playing. Just let them experience the game how a regular player would.

                              <span>From what I understand Twitter and Facebook are full of bots and politics(more so than before) and most sub reddits have rules about no self-promotion(which I like and think is a good thing). Sub reddits that don&#x27;t have these rules tend to be very low quality constant spam that only contain other devs, who are not your target audience. I do like those subs just for personal validation and talking about our projects as I have no one in real life to do so with, but anyways.
 Where do you find your audience now, on tik tok or something else? I am not a social media or marketing type of guy, but eventually I&#x27;ll want to let people know my game exists, where is the best place to start? I understand it&#x27;s not easy and I don&#x27;t expect it to be and it&#x27;ll be yet another skill to add to the list, but I&#x27;d like to know your opinions on where to go.

                              <span>Assuming we have a vulnerable c program and we found a buffer overflow vulnerability on the program and created an exploit on that. Can the same exploit be executed if the vulnerable c program runs on a different machine? Will memory addresses be the same?
 I think the answer is no they probably won´t even be the same when running only in the same environment and on the same machine. There is nothing like a guarantee that it will have the same address.
 A modern-day OS assigns the memory arbitrarily (within certain sections of course). This technique is called Address Space Layout Randomization. Also gcc or clang uses the --fstack-protector that prevents buffer overflow attacks
 Hence, my final question confuses me and make no sense for me based on this video is how geohot manage to exploit a buffer overflow attack remotely if addresses would not the same. He first did it locally and then remotely. How does he manage to achieve it?

                              <span>I was messing around on wifite and ran some scans. I saw a file in my hs directory that was titled reaver_output.hcap. I decided to take a look and used tcpdump -r  and saw the names of devices from my own local network specifically my printer. I wasn&#x27;t using wifite on my own network and never used reader. This seems very odd to me. It was placed in my home directory. Where I put other caps when running wifite. I checked the birth date of the file and it was created exactly when i was using wifite. 
 Has any one experienced this or could tell me why packets from my own local network were captured and then the file titled after a program I wasn&#x27;t using?

                              <span>Generating passwords for cracking is pretty common. But say you have 1k password attempts and that&#x27;s your limit. 
 What&#x27;s your golden rule for generating a custom word list for a target? Whether it&#x27;s an individual or organization. I.e first.last first.last etc.

                              <span>Hi, I write a small tool to print process memory usages, memory mappings and real-time process network connections. Those information could be important when debugging OOM situation because it is hard to collect those data once the process is killed. Users can use this to collect process information on a suspicious OOM process and once the process is killed then users can use the data that memdoor collected to debug what&#x27;s going on.

                              <span>A few weeks ago, I posted about a port of DirectX12 HelloTriangle official example to C. I&#x27;m working on the other examples and you can check them here: https://github.com/simstim-star/DirectX-Graphics-Samples-in-C
 Currently, I&#x27;ve only ported HelloTriangle, HelloBundles, HelloConstBuffers, HelloFrameBuffering, HelloTexture and HelloVADecode, but I intend to work on as many as I can. 
 Also, I&#x27;m working on porting DirectX-Headers to C, as they are necessary for the samples, but it is still a bit raw, as I&#x27;m developing them on an as-needed basis. This port is on this repo: https://github.com/simstim-star/DirectX-Headers-in-C

                              <span>Is it true that it is faster to sum an array of doubles by summing the numbers at even induces, then the ones at odd invoices, then adding the two results? If so, why?

                              <span>I&#x27;m still learning here. 
 I&#x27;m running latest kali linux on a legion 7, vmbox. Im using a Brostrend A1 network adapter.
 I&#x27;ve put it into monitor mode successfully with &#x27;airmon-ng check kill&#x27; + &#x27;airmon-ng start wlan0&#x27;. I can run &#x27;airodump-ng wlan0&#x27; (my adapter doesn&#x27;t change to wlan0mon, for some reason, despite an iwconfig showing it in monitor mode). I&#x27;m able to catch all kinds of aps and clients, bssid&#x27;s. 
 Okay so I captured my target bssid, I then ran airodump again to find my target clients. I&#x27;m pretty sure my phone is hiding it&#x27;s Mac address, because it doesn&#x27;t show up under 2.4 or 5ghz packet capture. But despite that I&#x27;m sitting with my whole family and no ones showing as being kicked off when I run aireplay-ng. When I run this I&#x27;ve tried deauth against just the full AP, but I&#x27;ve also tried several device Mac addresses that are showing up. It actually runs the deauth successfully. I&#x27;m seeing ack results. But yeah despite trying maybe 5 or 6 times on different networks and devices. It&#x27;ll run, but it won&#x27;t kick anyone off. 
 Any ideas? I can post some blurred out shots

                              <span>I&#x27;m acquainted with great code bases that heavily use Yaml, so I&#x27;m not really sure why other people dislike it. Spring Boot was my introduction, so it might be because I&#x27;ve only ever had good documentation when working with it, but when I see it used for K8s, I have no complaints. What&#x27;s the better alternative that people like using? (I&#x27;m particularly looking to hear from people who hate dealing with Yaml)

                              <span>I have been using Hashicorp Packer for creating QEMU / VMware OVMF images. With all the potential rug pulling and the subsequent forks of Hashicorp products, is there actually a fork for Packer?
 QEMU with command-line is quite verbose and tedious and I found the wrapper of HCL via Packer a bit more configuration friendly.
 If there is no fork, what are other tools being used to create such VM images in the OSS world?

                              <span>If you&#x27;re writing a Dockerfile to be executed within a CI/CD pipeline (Setup -&gt; Build -&gt; Analyze -&gt; Build Container -&gt; Deploy), would you prefer installing dependencies and building the application separately, or reusing the artifact from the previous build job? To me, the latter seems obvious, but I&#x27;ve only seen the former approach used so far.

                              <span>Apologies upfront for the long post. I&#x27;m going through some existential crisis and just felt like writing it out.
 I&#x27;ve been a developer for around 14-15 years and have worked on a lot of different tech and systems and have a good breadth of knowledge i&#x27;d say. 
 But i&#x27;ve never really worked on anything with huge amounts of data or low latency requirements or extremely high throughout etc. Have always worked in big orgs and on systems with moderate non-functional specs and lots of business features. Historically i&#x27;ve not been into developer communities or open source contributions (earlier in career due to lack of awareness and now due all sorts of stuff including lack of motivation to do this outside work hours). I&#x27;m trying to change this a bit recently by getting more involved in communities in my company.
 Having said that within my teams i&#x27;ve always got good remarks, hikes and considered as a solid all-round senior. Pay was always good and I mostly enjoyed my work (was almost too grateful to even be hired as a SWE at the start). I also keep myself quite updated even though most of that knowledge stays mostly theoretical.
 As I evaluate my career i wonder if I should have seeked out more challenging work? There seems to be an expectation that after all these years one would have atleast tackled some hard technical challenge and I cant seem to think of any. Slowly starting to feel if i&#x27;m actually good to even handle anything challenging now and that&#x27;s not helping my confidence to even look for such opportunities. What if I get an opportunity and fail?
 Just wondering if others have gone through such a phase and found their peace somehow? Or any advice on how to position myself for the next 15 years of my career?

                              <span>Maybe a better thing to ask would be: how do you ensure you’re recognized for the products of your work?
 I’ve had a strange problem for a while now: despite putting in the same hours as my coworkers, and being very productive in terms of tickets, I have for years now been receiving the feedback that I should work with more urgency, and should try to get things done faster. I genuinely do not slack off at all, but the fact that I keep receiving this feedback (and that it has followed me between companies) indicates to me that I’m clearly at least doing a poor job of representing myself.
 For example: once, after a particularly rough sprint a manager had a version of this conversation with me, and we pulled up metrics, and over the course of that sprint I’d completed more tickets than anyone else on the team, and had completed the same number of “urgent” tickets as the rest of the team combined. (And it’s not as though I just pick easy tickets to pump my numbers)
 In one-off situations like that it’s easy to be like, look, I’m sorry I’m giving off this appearance, but if we look at the actual work that got done I think it’s clear I’m pulling my weight… but it’s really not a conversation I enjoy having over and over. Instead I’d really like to just not give off that appearance in the first place.

                              <span>Hey all. So going to jump right in I&#x27;ve been inthe same role with the same place since I started being a software dev just under 8 years ago fresh out of a bootcamp. Without being too much a whiner I&#x27;ll explain
 1.hired in at too high a role. There was one right below the position I was hired in that I didn&#x27;t even know existed until a few years later which would have been more appropriate, but I made it through.
 2. This one is the most awkward but basically I had a manager who had a terrible rep for not promoting/supporting his female subordinates (which is someone else I didn&#x27;t find out until much later and after the guy got laid off)
 3. Covid was weird for my company so no a lot of promotions going on for that first year or so.
 4. My spouse died very suddenly 2 years ago and I discovered him (hard story, sorry) and, as you can imagine, that first year or so after I wasn&#x27;t super focused on career development. 
 So now I&#x27;m living in a different place and am thinking about switching up roles at a new company but I don&#x27;t really know how to plan out my resume. I know the market is hard enough as it is right now so I need all the advice I can get. Thanks all!

                              <span>I&#x27;m the lead for a small team (5 devs), we do upgrades and new features to a set of analysis tools for a couple of customers that we have been working with for years. A junior dev suggested we implement a set of features on our current project that we had done on the last. I explained to him that we didn&#x27;t have requirements for that and because of differences in the implementation, they wouldn&#x27;t really work for this customer.
 On Friday he emailed the customer and asked them if they were planning on flowing us new requirements for the features that we discussed because it would make the tool much better. He didn&#x27;t copy me, but the customer emailed back, copying me, and said they were considering it. I replied that we could discuss it, but gave the reasons why it wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea for them.
 They also copied our management and our director came and yelled at me for &quot;requirements fishing&quot; - someone at the customer felt we were trying to increase the scope to inflate the contract value. To be honest, my reply wasn&#x27;t the best (I didn&#x27;t think it through enough and I can see why they might have thought we were coordinating)
 I&#x27;m pissed, if I were management, I&#x27;d fire him. To top it off, I think he realized that it&#x27;s coming back on him, he disappeared and I couldn&#x27;t find him Friday afternoon. I&#x27;ve got to do damage control with management on Monday - how would you handle this?

                              <span>Long story short I&#x27;m in the early stages of my career, I&#x27;m a generalist so I do sculpting, to retopo, materials, animations. Then I do vfx shaders in hlsls and the material editor in ue5 for animated fx on materials, I do a lot of complicated stuff with niagara scripting my own modules and things so they react to audio or aniamte how I need or react how I need.
 Then I do blueprint and some c++ which is still my weak point but I&#x27;m learning and I understand it quite well.
 I work with houdini for some things but overall I delve into a lot of different skill sets to accomplish so much since I&#x27;m usually the only developer being hired for my clients projects.
 Now this isn&#x27;t an issue since I&#x27;m very passionate about all of it and I&#x27;m really in love with code at the minute.

Any thoughts on the fiasco from the business side or game design side? Perhaps could anyone give some insights as to why a dev would promote something like this?

                              <span>I recently released one of my old puzzle games on Steam for fun. Since then, I&#x27;ve gotten emails almost daily from &quot;Streamers&quot; who are asking for a free Steam key. They almost always say something along the lines of &quot;I haven&#x27;t streamed in a long time but I am wanting to get back into. I heard about your game from a friend and it seems perfect!&quot; and then link to a twitch profile that has been inactive for two years.
 I know that these are likely bots/scammers looking for free steam keys to resell. My game is 2 bucks though...

Yeah, i would recommend not launching a steam page if you are intent on looking for a publisher, as the steam page launch is generally a pretty big marketing beat that they&#x27;d want some control over.
  
We&#x27;ve been working on a game that we intend to get a publisher for. Our plan was to launch a steam page soon because I heard somewhere way in the past that before you even pitch to publishers, you must provide proof that people are interested in your game. I&#x27;ve read that some even had to have successful Kickstarter campaigns before big publishers took them seriously.
 So I&#x27;d like to ask people here who have experienced having their game picked up by publishers, is that really the case?

                              <span>During an interview a while back, I was asked what the Pillars of Game Design are. I was curious what other developers thought about this question. It feels like it is dependent on the type of game you are making i.e. multiplayer, single player, coop, open world, shooter, rpg, action adventure, survival horror, etc.
 But I certainly could be wrong. Maybe there is a best/universal/one size fits all answer here. Is there a gold standard of game design knowledge that I am missing here?

                              <span>I was doing some market research for my next game and came upon those two games:
  
Vojo: price: 0.99$, released in march 2022, currently has 237 reviews.
 
SIZIF: price: 0.99$, released in july 2023, currently has 13 reviews.
 
 Both games are endless runners with a minimalistic style, they have the same features, are both the dev’s first game, have good reviews, and have very little coverage on youtube and other social medias.
 So why do you think one has almost 20 times more reviews than the other? I am genuinely curious because it doesn’t really make any sense to me…

 The market is bad and it&#x27;s hard to get a job. But this isn&#x27;t unique to tech. A majority of skilled jobs are hard to get right now besides traditionally stable fields like medicine or accounting. Go into any other career reddit and it&#x27;s the same issue. The amount of posts I see about people regretting getting into CS, thinking of switching majors, or just dropping out of college are so near sighted. And fair enough, you want to know your effort is worthwhile. But don&#x27;t romanticise the job market for everyone else.Just about EVERYONE has it bad right now. Unless you want to specifi…</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone, i&#x27;m currently having some issue with Rust, where after each change I make rust recompiles all dependencies. I&#x27;ve found some post on this topic on stackoverflow, but unfortunately the solutions didn&#x27;t helped in my case or maybe I misunderstood something while trying them out, so I came here to post my issue.
 use bevy::prelude::*; fn main() { App::new() .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins) .add_systems(Update, file_drag_and_drop_system) .run(); } fn file_drag_and_drop_system(mut events: EventReader) { for event in events.read() { info!(&quot;{:? }&quot;, event); } } 
 I simply add an addition space after the ? character in the file_drag_and_drop_system function. Then press ctrl + s to save the change and after that use cargo run / cargo build. In both cases cargo recompiles all dependencies.
 The things I&#x27;ve tried so far:
  
Some people suggested, that the problem is that the build incremental isn&#x27;t set to true.
 Others said, that setting the CARGO_TARGET_DIR environmental variable to a different folder might solve the problem.
  
config.toml in .cargo folder
 Prior to my issue I also set up the cargo.toml file after the Bevy getting started guide.
 [package] name &#x3D; &quot;bevy_01&quot; version &#x3D; &quot;0.1.0&quot; edition &#x3D; &quot;2021&quot; [workspace] resolver &#x3D; &quot;2&quot; # Important! wgpu/Bevy needs this! # NOTE: Remember to remove &quot;dynamic_linking&quot; before releasing your game! # Otherwise you will need to include libbevy_dylib alongside your game if you want it to run. # If you remove the &quot;dynamic&quot; feature, your game executable can run standalone. [dependencies] bevy &#x3D; { version &#x3D; &#x27;0.13&#x27;, features &#x3D; [&quot;dynamic_linking&quot;] } # Enable a small amount of optimization in debug mode [profile.dev] opt-level &#x3D; 1 # Enable high optimizations for dependencies (incl. Bevy), but not for our code: [profile.dev.package.&quot;*&quot;] opt-level &#x3D; 3 
 I&#x27;m using VSCode with Rust Analyzer on Windows 10, Rust version v1.79.0-nightly
 Thanks in advance for any help

                              <span>I use React.js for building web UIs, It&#x27;s OK but i would much rather write Go. I tend to dislike programming with js, especially with large projects for a variety of reasons, like slow lsp, large imports section, lot&#x27;s of dependencies, lack of useful primitives, bad error handeling.
 React.js makes it easy to manipulate the page however you want, also it has a lot of component libraries that handle stuff like animations and certain behaviors. 
 I heard there is htmx but apparently, it&#x27;s supposed to be an ajax library, i don&#x27;t mind doing fetches and writing javascript for that (much prefer it actually since there is a ton of stuff i would do when i ajax in case of errors, retries, signal abortion...). The javascript i hate writing is usually the dom manipulation javascript that you use to do something in the page. Is there something that handles this stuff that works with Go?

                              <span>Been looking a lot lately into what charm has been doing with bubbletea for the TUI component and wish for the server component. Didn&#x27;t see a good example on how to use the public key passed from the ssh server into the bubbletea app so I made one myself. General idea is to use one&#x27;s public key over ssh as a user identifier and then assign user roles to gate off content. 
 You can check the repo out here: https://gitlab.com/rdubwiley/texty
 Hope it&#x27;s useful if someone wants ideas on how to expose their TUI to the web or if someone is thinking of different ways to need user authentication for their ssh app.

                              <span>I am currently working on a RISC-V emulator. The requirement is that emulator should achieve near native performance. I am new to emulator programming. I have written an emulator for Gameboy, there I did instruction emulation by brute force ( writing functions for each instruction), which adds lot of performance overhead. I am wondering if there are some emulation techniques which might be useful to speed up the emulation.

 I wanted to reach out to the community for some guidance. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping to get
  
Any websites, tutorials, or online courses you highly recommend for learning about x86 architecture, ARM architecture, and the translation process itself would be fantastic!
 
Articles or white papers that provide a clear explanation of the different translation techniques (emulation vs static translation) would be super helpful.
 
If there are any must-read books on this topic, please point me in the right direction! I&#x27;m open to both beginner-friendly introductions and more advanced texts for when I get comfortable with the basics.
 
 Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>You probably have seen those ads where the player&#x27;s character shoots at enemies and objects on a 2D road. The player deliberately makes incorrect choices to entice you to play the game, but the ad is fake and the game is a pay-to-play base-building a la Clash of Clans.
 So what are those ads? If I were to guess, they are games thrown together in 15 minutes in a game engine like Unity just to make the ad. Would I be correct?

                              <span>This is obviously super suggestive, but do others struggle with creating good UI compared to well executed gameplay mechanics and level design? Not sure if I just don’t have an eye for it but creating good UI is always a struggle. Any UI masters in this community, please share some useful tips if possible.

 What polish do you prioritise, especially when time limited? We often talk about things in general terms on here, but what about specific details?
 For me, I lean towards music and sound effects. It&#x27;s often something I don&#x27;t bother too much with until the end of a project. Probably because it&#x27;s the field I&#x27;m least knowledgeable about.

                              <span>Hi,
 When someone can mostly go into small indies instead of big gamedev corporations like Ubisoft or EA, is getting laid off or getting fired so frequent? 
 Is here anybody, who only worked for small indie companies (with less than 10 people), and get constantly laid off or fired after maximum 2 years? 
 Is here anybody, who could work for one small startup-like indie company for more than 3 years as a programmer?

 I remember seeing posts on this sub not too long ago about people complaining that they had too little work to do while making 250k TC and working remotely from their fishing boat. Now, the posts have transitioned from the market being terrible to FAANG offshoring/outsourcing jobs, DEI/race wars, and class action lawsuits against bootcamps.
 Man, this place is really something else.

 Being the nosy person I am, I want to know which company you worked at that was pretty bad, if any.

                              <span>I’ve increasingly seen companies say they won’t hire junior developers because they waste time and money training them for them to just leave.
 There’s something really sick to me on a fundamental level about the idea of people leaving a job after a few years to go from $160k to $180k. It’s hard for me to personally justify being a part of such a huge class divide. 
 Edit: guys I’m not saying juniors are getting paid that. That’s an example of my friend who sent from senior to staff. It’s just an example of “person getting paid 6 figures leaves job to get paid slightly more 6 figures” and how casual it is would be unfathomable to most Americans, and you’re all showing how out of touch you are by ignoring the point and focusing on the numbers lmao.
 I’m not blaming anyone who jumps jobs (I wish we could hop jobs all the time it’s our right as workers) I’m just curious to have a discussion if anyone else feels the same. But I’m already exhausted of Reddit after 10 comments lmao. It is impossible to have a good faith discussion on the internet 😂😂

                              <span>My girlfriend (a non-programmer) recently asked me what it means when programmers say that &quot;everything is just binary under the hood&quot;. I started telling her how files don&#x27;t intrinsically &quot;mean&quot; something and that programs simply do something with the bytes.
 For instance, an image utility assumes that if there is a file.png somewhere and its internal binary layout follows the PNG conventions then it must be an image and it will display that image on screen interpreting the bytes as RGBA values. However, other programs may interpret these same bytes differently and do other things with them.
 To demo that concept in the most obvious way, I created snapsound - a CLI (for now) that allows you to transform any MP3 file into a PNG image but retain the ability to play back the original sound. It&#x27;s as simple as
 snapsound snap song.mp3 # Creates song.png snapsound play song.png 
 If you&#x27;re curious, the code is completely open source on GitHub. It can be easily installed with go intall.
 As a summation of this little research effort, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it is to write a program that plays sound in Go! The only thing is, I think that github.com/gopxl/beep (one of the deps) requires CGo to build on Linux, but MacOS and Windows are pure Go, no need for anything else (already tested both).

                              <span>I am a seasoned engineer with experience with more than one language and lately I am learning go. I am all in.
 One thing I am still getting used to is how the file system API is designed, I might get used to it with time, but for the moment it feels a bit sparse.
 You have os for most things, filepath surprisingly has a Glob function, then a bunch of things implementing io.Reader and io.Writer and so on.
 I tried very hard for weeks to not write to disk in my tests, but it sounds borderline an antipattern at this point. I would have to create a specific struct with all my functionality and a mock for it.
 What I am used to, and thought was a good design, was to have all fs methods to take a fs instance and given that go does do that for few things I was confused when I don&#x27;t see that as just &quot;the way to do it&quot;.
 Also, os.DirFS is admittedly broken for things that require dynamic paths or cross os compat, which makes it hard to use things like MapFS in your tests (MapFS looks so good on paper).
 Is there something I need to learn about this to get more comfortable or did I get to the same conclusion as everyone else?

                              <span>Only thing I ever did is Competitive programming using C++, although I can write code in python too. I wanted to learn development(Server side to be precise) but I feel like everyone is doing NodeJS,Django etc at this point, so I wanted to learn something different. Should I proceed with Go at this point for development ( I heard its good for server side development) or should I stick with more traditional options. Also at later point I want a job too.

                              <span>As a beginner what all projects you build that helped you get good at concurrency in Go ?
 What all resources you looked into ?
 I&#x27;m a beginner learning Go and wanted to get good at concurrency and build projects.
 Do share repos that i can look into to learn this. I&#x27;m having hard time reading big repositories. So small projects would be helpful. 
 Thank you. 
 Btw Go is my first programming language!

                              <span>I&#x27;m not a big guy on &quot;personal projects&quot; but I&#x27;m trying to change that, so i started working on a spaceInvaders emulator in rust and after i spent a good 10 hours ( I&#x27;m slow :p ) implementing all opcodes and making sure they work correctly i noticed that I&#x27;ll need to change it all, so i wanted to ask. How do you guys usually imagine your code structure beforehand in detail and cleanly. cuz im noticing that I have the same issue at work my philosophy is to think about the task good enough then start implementing as fast as possible so that if I fail, I fail fast and have time to recover, because in my mind there are stuff I wont be able to predict no matter how long I think about it, but my issue is that the amount of things that I cant predict is a lot more than what other developers cant predict, one of those things is overall structure for example (as simple as it may be :) ), so how do you guys approach this sort of tasks, and if you have any advice on how to improve it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been living in a VHCOL city on the west coast for the past few years, working as a software engineer. My company has an office out here, but announced recently they&#x27;re closing it at the end of the month, after which I&#x27;ll be fully remote.
 I don&#x27;t particularly care for the city I live in, and thought that remote work would be a great opportunity to move to a larger city with more energy, namely NYC. I&#x27;ve been floating this idea around my team since the announcement of the closure was made, and haven&#x27;t gotten any negative feedback around it, so I felt pretty confident about the topic when I officially asked my boss if I could move to NYC after I become fully remote.
 He got back to me a few days later (after speaking with HR), and said that a move is totally doable, if I take a $50k pay cut in my TC. I was pretty floored at this request, especially since by any metric NYC is more expensive than where I currently live, but the rationale is that the pay bands in NYC are ostensibly lower for my job compared to my current city.
 I&#x27;m wondering, is this level of pay cut common for a move from the west coast to NYC? It seems totally unreasonable to me, especially after looking at jobs at some of the other tech companies operating out of NYC. Many of these companies actually explicitly state that their pay bands are identical for NYC and the city I live in currently. Does anyone has experience with this kind of move?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;ve been planning my work not just around my calendar but also how difficult the work im trying to do may be. For example, 8 hours of coding in one day is half as productive as 4 hours one day and another 4 hours the next. So I try to spend half a day coding and half a day writing, networking, and applying to jobs. Sometimes reading fits into this but for material that&#x27;s particularly challenging or math heavy I may dedicate a coding day to that material.
 What makes this tricky is some days my brain works better than others, and it&#x27;s not entirely predictable. I coded for 12 hours straight on Thursday because I noticed I was having a &quot;good brain day,&quot; but Friday passed and it&#x27;s now Saturday and I barely have enough brain juice to write this reddit post.
 I&#x27;m curious if other people plan their work around things like this and what tips/tricks they may have!

There. Is. Always. A. Blocker. He&#x27;s literally a black hole on the team in terms of output.

                              <span>I heard this metaphor a long time ago. I forget where and from whom. I also forget exactly how it went, but the basic idea was this. Developers are going to want to build their sandcastles. And the idea I think it was trying to express was the desire of software developerss to build the most complete, robust, and elegant solutions they could engineer for the problems they are trying to solve.
 Sometimes this may be good, but the context I think I remember the metaphor in was that of, &quot;project managers are necessary otherwise develops will never make progress towards a end goal, with endless scope creep and analysis paralysis&quot;. Thinking about it now, I think this metaphor was being used in reference to the video game industry when I heard it.
 This post is two part, firstly, and mostly for my curiosity, I was hoping you all who are familiar with this expression could remind me exactly how it goes and provide your take on it.
 Secondly, I would like to start a discussion on the topic. At work, I don&#x27;t really seem to face this issue that often. But when working on a personal project, I seem to almost never get very far because I get stuck in this trance where I am trying to over engineer the first problems I come across with any amount of complexity. For example, I have tried writing a vulkan renderer multiple times now, and each time I get stuck on trying to build a thesis on device and queue selection, coding for every use case that I can imagine, when in reality I only need one or two simple methods for accomplishing this task. So, have any of you also ever struggled with this, and what are some good ways to work around this?

                              <span>I saw this company&#x27;s website, where they claim to provide &quot;a specialized high-performance managed-cloud&quot; with 100% SLA. They have a cloud hosting SLA page, where they state that customers are not eligible for compensation in circumstances beyond their reasonable control. Those are:
  
scheduled maintenance, emergency maintenance, upgrades
 force majeure events, interrupts/delays in telecommunications or third party services
 targeted attacks
 ...
  
I don&#x27;t fully grasp the concept of SLA yet, but it feels that they just excluded all the possible conditions for downtime, to be able to claim 100% uptime. It looks even worse because they look like &quot;resellers&quot;, in the sense that they are offering you a managed experience of somebody else&#x27;s cloud (companies can do that?), and then they exclude third party interrupts/delays. 
 What do you think of this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started learning rust, and for the most part when i have done short coding challanges and parsing of data i seem to be able to make the code work properly (after some compiler error fixes). Most short scripts didnt require any use of lifetimes.
 When i try to get into writing my own structs and enums, the moment that the data access isn&#x27;t trivial (like immutable linked list over a generic type) i hit a wall with the many smart pointer types and which one to use (and when to just use the &amp; reference), and how to think of lifetimes when i write it. Moreover, the compiler errors and suggestions tend to be cyclic and not lead to fixing the code.
 If anyone has some tips on how to approach annotating lifetimes and in general resources on lifetimes and references for beginners i would very much appreciate sharing them.

                              <span>I switched my primary language from C/C++ to rust around 5 years back. I have been interviewing lately for a job change. Most of the interviews were 45 min affairs, solving Leetcode style problems (why ?? - that is a separate discussion).
 Sadly, I have come to realize rust is not ideal for this scenario, and going to switch back to C for these coding rounds. Most of these interviews involved working with 2D arrays, linked list, binary trees and such which would be relatively simple in C/C++.
 More context: I have had to spend a good part of the 45 min setting up these primitives, before even trying to solve the core algorithmic challenge. Few reasons:
  
Things like coderpad don&#x27;t let you use external crates (e.g) there is one for 2D arrays
 Some questions involve removing elements from middle of lists in O(1) time. I had to hand roll a doubly linked list with unsafe pointer usage to achieve that, which itself easily filled the time
  
With C/C++, these interviews used to go lot better, uh. Now I think: use C/C++ for interviews, rust for product development. Any thoughts?

 What will you do then?
 I&#x27;ll get into homesteading and alpaca husbandry. Away from the city, away from the industrial chaos corrupting our minds - to a good life of harvesting mushrooms and knitting alpaca socks. Might also get into archeology like i wanted as a child.

                              <span>Any really really highly recommended courses? Can be anything devops or IT
 My company has used Udemy for a long time, but I&#x27;ve been in IT for awhile so never used it. On a curious glance, I looked at a Linux course on udemy last week, I&#x27;ve been using Linux for years so didn&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;d learn a bunch. It was amazing! So much interesting stuff I&#x27;d never come across before.

                              <span>I’ve been exploring the CDK space recently and started looking more into Pulumi. I have read some absolute nightmares of the migration from Terraform, but I’m curious if anyone has had a pleasant experience? I was intrigued by the YAML abilities as we provide a lot of self service modules for developers. Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts

                              <span>I have switched to using C# instead of GDScript for a few months now, and here is what I have learned that I wish I had known earlier, in case anyone here is looking to try C# for their project.
  
You can use the latest stable version of .NET (8.0). Godot 4.2 will still default to 6.0, but you can edit your .csproj file to change this.
 
Believe it or not, you can use full native AOT compilation with C# in Godot projects. That&#x27;s right: no more virtual machine IL interpreting JIT nonsense. Real machine code. Interpreted languages require too much imagination.
 
 Set it up like below, and you can completely ditch the CLR runtime and its dependencies for your game and get considerable performance gains. No more shitty virtual machine shit, unless you want stuff like runtime code generation &amp;…</span>

 Someone purchased my game recently and ran it on a very low spec Linux laptop. They knew full well that they didn&#x27;t meet the system requirements, but wanted to try it anyway. Turned out the game ran pretty awfully on Proton because of their hardware, the framerate skipped wildly around, their progress kept getting wiped out, and certain textures either didn&#x27;t load or popped in after several minutes.
 I had put off building for Linux until I could boot it up myself on an old PC, so I spent the day trying to debug the issue with them and figure out if there were certain settings that could improve their experience.
 In the end, we couldn&#x27;t find any fixes. So I took a leap of faith, put all my chips on Godot and just blindly built a Linux version for them without testing it, figuring it probably wouldn&#x27;t work but was worth a shot.
 It worked PERFECTLY, first try, no issues.
 Love this engine, love you guys. Shown above is me and the new player absolutely dumbfounded by Godot effortlessly taking care of business.

                              <span>just graduated with a BS in Software Engineering and like. what do you even do? the market is terrible and saturated. my degree took 2 extra years to finish due to my disability, and the worth of this degree seemed to only get worse and worse. in 2018 when I started it made sense to get this degree, now I feel like I would have been better off doing literally anything else. im now unemployed due to no longer being a student and therefore no more student job, and everywhere that I&#x27;ve applied to has either ghosted me or needed post-graduate experience. the entry level position feels dead. 
 i just had an interview with a startup and I was told im not what they&#x27;re looking for. at what point do you become what they&#x27;re fucking looking for? what was the point of my degree? 
 what do I do? do I just keep applying to this stupid rat race and hope something sticks?

                              <span>Recently got to last round interviews at a startup. Currently make 70k/yr at my current position and they offered 73k on 3 month contract-to-hire
 I have 3YOE. They said they loved me, and I told them this was too low and I preferred 44-50/hr. Their job description was 30-50
 He didn’t seem happy and said he’d get back to me by Monday.
 I feel like I blew it considering I’ve been looking for an opportunity for almost a year now.

                              <span>Seriously, it is so unjust and slimy to operate a boot camp right now. It&#x27;s like the ITT Tech fiasco from a decade ago. These vermin know that 99% of their alumni will not get jobs.
 It was one thing doing a bootcamp in 2021 or even 2022, but operating a bootcamp in 2023 and 2024 is straight up fucking fraud. These are real people right now taking out massive loans to attend these camps. Real people using their time and being falsely advertised to. Yeah, they should have done their diligence but it still shouldn&#x27;t exist.
 It&#x27;s like trying to start a civil engineering bootcamp with the hopes that they can get you to build a bridge in 3 months. The dynamics of this field have changed to where a CS degree + internships is basically the defacto &#x27;license&#x27; minimum for getting even the most entry level jobs now.

                              <span>I am currently working as a strat for a large bank, we predominantly code in c++ and python. I have somehow ended up managing a team of 10 persons, mostly vps and some associates. I am director myself and now barely code, although need to debug regularly to help the team when they are blocked.
 Thing is I was a bit naive and thought I had to climb the corporate ladder to increase comp, but I have now realised I would be much happier as an IC. I can now see that some vps are better paid than I thought so I would not mind going down a level and revised down comp.
 I find the management side of things quite draining actually, and I don&#x27;t feel the numbers add up to justify it.
 Wondering if anyone ever went though the same process? Internally or applied externally for an lower rung role?

Nobody uses the tool, the business doesn&#x27;t care about it since it doesn&#x27;t generate money and it isn&#x27;t critical to the business, and it seems like most of the members on the team have checked out and will only do something if the manager starts pressuring them.
 Obviously I can leave but the market sucks right now. What else can be done here? Is there a way to get the company to care about it?

                              <span>Apart from using an actual debugger - in some cases you can’t have a debugger attached to the process, or the behavior you’re facing is complex and emergent, and you cannot just put a breakpoint or log statement there. If attaching a debugger is possible, then of course I just attach a debugger.
 Let me share mines:
  
Isolate - if something’s tricky, try to have the simplest isolated reproduction that you can have. This cuts out unnecessary complexity and usually also speeds up iterations.
 Isolate early - it’s tempting to think that “I just need to fix this here, redeploy and it’ll probably work”, but I found that more often than not, I should have isolated the case earlier. It’s balancing between the likelihood of fixing it in place in a couple of iterations with a longer cycle and between investing time upfront in the isolation to have shorter feedback cycle. Also, the skill of efficiently isolating cases is something that improves with practice.
 “Approach from two ends” - I’m not sure if this has a name, sometimes it can be called ‘binary search’. When I tried everything that I could think of but it all doesn’t seem to make any sense, then I step back and try to ‘brute force’ it. This usually starts by taking my problematic case on one end, and a known working example of what I’m trying to achieve on the other end. Then I start modifying on both ends: stripping down parts on the first end, and adding more and more parts on the other end, so that they become more and more similar. At some point, the difference that I didn’t think of pops out. A similar approach also works for example if a new release of an app has a regression, but it’s not clear from the code change why - then we can start producing synthetic approximation releases in a test environment to see where exactly things break. I really like this approach, it really helped me solve cases where I had no idea why things don’t work.

                              <span>Does anyone know of a tool that can hide Linux command line arguments from being displayed? I remember someone posted a personal project that did so and it didn’t require root to run. Unfortunately I cannot remember the name or the post but I’m almost positive it was posted here.

                              <span>I am trying to locate a windows login bypass utility that I cannot remember the name of. If memory serves, the bootable tool would do something to the kernel to basically allowing any value to be typed into the password field. The utility did not reset or modify any system or passwords, just allowed bypass.
 I have the need of gaining admin access to a device, but due to the nature of the device, I need to do so in a way that does not modify any system files in any manner.
 Any help appreciated!

 Something thats been on my mind, i know there have been some instances of smart video camera doorbells getting hacked.
 Smart lights are connect to wi-fi and can be controlled by a smartphone app.
 Is there any risk of other devices like a laptop being reached thats connected to the same wifi network?

                              <span>Hello, I am looking for an osint tool I used to work with a couple of years ago. It was a map, and whenever something big would happen(terrorist attack, natural disaster, etc) it would create a bubble and it would give you up to the minute information on it. I cannot for the life of me remember what it was called. I want to have it pulled up at my work 24/7. thanks in advance.

                              <span>I recently lost my job. I didn&#x27;t particularly like it, so it&#x27;s not sad in that sense; however, the financial implications are obviously less than ideal.
 I&#x27;ve been interested in cybersecurity for a long time and even took the CompTIA Security+ certification a few years ago just for fun, but that is the extent of my relevant experience. I want to use this as an opportunity to upskill myself and finally break into a field that I am genuinely passionate about, and I do not mind starting from the bottom. I have enough saved that I can go at this full time, 8-10 hours a day, for the next 4 months. Importantly, I have basically no other commitments.
 I have outlined a plan:
  
 Month 1: TryHackMe + HTB boxes with walkthrough to get the basics down and document all progress. 
 Month 2: Study for and take the PNPT (can&#x27;t afford the OSCP), continue with HTB and THM. 
 Month 3: Renew Security+ cert and start applying for tons of jobs, keep going at it with HTB and THM. 
 Month 4: Keep applying, and hopefully get some interviews, and keep doing the same stuff and document all progress. And if I get no results maybe try my luck in Bug Bounty hunting.
  
I know this is a massive undertaking, and I realize it&#x27;s going to be a tough few months. But I&#x27;ve always seemed to learn quickly, and I&#x27;m very committed to making this happen.
 I would greatly appreciate any feedback, critique, and advice that could help me in my journey.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve written pktstat-bpf, a simple replacement for ncurses/libpcap-based pktstat, using Linux eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) program, allowing packet statistics gathering even under very high traffic volume conditions, typically several million packets per second even on an average server. In this scenario (high volume, DoS attacks etc.) typically regular packet capture solutions start being unreliable due to increasing packet loss.
 By default it uses TC (Traffic Control) eBPF hooks with TCX attaching requiring at minimum Linux kernel v6.6 for both ingress and egress traffic statistics. Alternatively it can switch to XDP (eXpress Data Path) hook but with a consequence of losing egress statistics since XDP works only in ingress path. XDP mode due to XDP program to network interface attaching calls requires at minimum Linux kernel v5.9. Some distributions might have backported XDP/TC patches (notable example is Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel) and eBPF program might work on older kernels too.
 When using XDP on SmartNICs (100GE and more) it is possible to run in XDP Offloaded mode where XDP program loads directly on NIC with hardware XDP support and executes without using CPU, allowing wire speed statistics even on 100+Gbps speeds.
 At the end of the execution program will display per-IP and per-protocol statistics sorted by per-connection bps, packets and (source-IP:port, destination-IP:port) tuples, either in plaintext or as JSON.
 Program consists of the eBPF code in C and the pure-Go userland Golang program that parses and outputs final IP/port/protocol/bitrate statistics. Go part of the program uses wonderful cillium/ebpf library to load and run eBPF program, interfacing with eBPF map.
 I would be glad to hear about any improvements, bugs or otherwise. File an issue or ping me in the comments. Thanks!

 Here&#x27;s the post that triggered it: https://x.com/halftonegaming/status/1786427978609537520
 I&#x27;ve never been a big twitter user but I&#x27;m honestly baffled by this. What&#x27;s the point of a platform where your reach is limited if your posts get engagement? Has this happened to anyone else? Also is tagging support in a public post really the only way to contact their customer support? This is wild

                              <span>I have a background in the medical field that I left a few years ago to start making games- something I&#x27;ve always loved, ever since I was a young kid trying to rope my siblings into playing my D&amp;D campaigns with me.
 There&#x27;s been a lot of learning and a few failed projects and teams that fell apart- the last one about a year ago put a rift between my best friend (the project&#x27;s programmer), another friend (artist), and me (game designer).
 And now, I&#x27;ve been spending the last 6 months making a spooky strategy game that has some genuinely interesting things about it, and my efforts to promote it have left such a bad taste in my mouth.

                              <span>The image crate, Rust&#x27;s most popular image handling library, is out with a new release! It brings speedups and other enhancements for a variety of image formats.
 JPEG
 This release switches from jpeg-decoder to zune-jpeg crate for decoding JPEG images. This brings a massive performance improvement.
 zune-jpeg&#x27;s performance is on par with libjpeg-turbo, an extensively optimized library that has more assembly in it than C. Matching that performance in pure Rust is an outstanding achievement!
 Because of this change, the obscure &quot;lossless JPEG&quot; format used almost exclusively in medical imaging is no longer supported. If you need to handle lossless JPEG, we recommend using jpeg-decoder directly.
 This change also allows proper support for memory limits. jpeg-decoder could allocate potentially…</span>

Your responses were helpful, comical (roasting mgr), and most importantly emphasizing the true scope and scale of the request as being largely unrealistic. I checked out the recommended tools, and some of you gave me avenues for quick shortcuts and workarounds, but overall I was convinced that this is not worth trying to any appreciable degree. My fear is getting too deep into a project only to fail to deliver, and I was armed with enough general consensus to make an informed statement to stakeholders that the project, as outlined, was not feasible without outside resources in this timeframe. With that, I showed them RenPy and said I could deliver on a visual novel, nothing more, and that it could be both informative and interactive, but…</span>

                              <span>I’ve been developing games and I feel very confident in being able to program most mechanics and systems. I also am very confident in my model and rigging skills. While developing games though they tend to feel very sandbox-y and tend to not feel quite as polished as a lot of professionally made games. I’ve added some polish techniques like invisible walls, more linear level design but they still feel “projecty” and not at the level of a product. Any tips and tricks anyone has to make their games feel more professional?

Made with Go-Raylib (OpenGL framework) https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go the game is (not very good) free on Steam.
 Before looking at the code be warned I taught myself to code and it is unconventional. However, it may be useful or inspirational for someone so here it is https://github.com/unklnik/bitty_knight
 Free to play on Steam https://store.steampowered.com/app/2751370/Bitty_Knight/

 I&#x27;m a beginner to programming and was learning Go for some time now.
 I have build only simple projects.
 Can you share some of the cool projects you have built ? Any project ideas to share ?
 Would also like to know what all projects you put up in your resume to get your first job ? Have you deployed the projects you have put up in your resume ?
 Any tips or anything for a beginner trying to get job in this tiring market?
 Also can you share some open source projects I can try to contribute ? Ik it&#x27;s hard but It sounds cool to contribute on cool projects.

                              <span>This may be an odd question, but I&#x27;m thinking ahead for Father&#x27;s Day gifts for my husband, and he really enjoys using golang. Is there any item, physical book or manual, or really anything at all that involves golang that you use regularly an get a lot of use out of or enjoy?
 **Edit** Thank you for all the fantastic ideas! I&#x27;m sure I will be able to find him something special from these amazing suggestions! Wow, what great ideas!!

 Hi! I recently (finally!) finished a planned blog post introducing the Lua runtime piccolo and I wanted to share it here. This is not a new project, and I&#x27;ve talked about it before, but it has recently resumed active work, and I&#x27;ve never had a chance to actually talk about it properly before in public in one place that I can point to.
 This is not meant as an advertisement to use piccolo or to even contribute to piccolo as much as it is a collection of thoughts about stackless interpreters, garbage collection, interpreter design, and (sort of) a love letter to coroutines. It is also a demo of piccolo and what makes it unique, and there are some examples for you to try out in live REPLs on the blog post.
 I hope you find it interesting!

 Godot Project Builder is a graphical automation tool for exporting and publishing Godot projects. It supports automated tasks for exports, uploading to popular stores (Steam, GOG, Epic, itch io) and basic file operations, all configured using a convenient GUI.
 It&#x27;s available as a project (requires at least Godot 4.3 dev6) or executable. You can get it here: https://github.com/KoBeWi/Godot-Project-Builds or in the AssetLib. Includes installable plugin for quick launch directly from your project.
 Project Builder supports exporting projects both from Godot 4 and Godot 3.

                              <span>There really is too much to know these days, what areas are there to specialize in?
 My thoughts:
 Kubernetes - I can see why some engineers love it. An awesome paradigm at the base layer and so much interesting built on top of it.
 Observability - almost a science in itself and plenty to get into (or related to) be it monitoring, alerting, analytics, service management. 
 Platform management - building out a consumable platform, kinda like being a developer for developers.
 Architect - the problem I have with this is developers are going to have their own software architects doing system design that the may overlap already with the infra side. Also many expect engineers to have software architects skills anyway. So where does that leave the cloud/DevOps architect? I feel there is not much mileage in this path.
 Any others? As each year passes the more I think it is not a good idea to stay in the middle as a generalist and time to pick a path.

                              <span>As suggested by someone from this community, I&#x27;ve moved the pipelines on Automate All The Things from Azure Devops to GitHub Actions.
 I didn’t know GitHub Actions was free when the repo is public. This makes it SOO much easier to get started with the project, so thank you stranger who suggested this!
 https://github.com/tferrari92/automate-all-the-things
 The Azure DevOps version is still there in its own branch.
 Any other feedback or suggestions are always welcomed! There&#x27;s always room for improvement.
 Also.. Nirvana Edition with Backstage.io is coming soon!

                              <span>How do you manage the changes in Infrastructure as code, with respect to testing before putting into production? Production infra might differ a lot from the lower environments. Sometimes the infra component we are making a change to, may not even exist on a non-prod environment.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Recently I joined company with very bad codebase. Plain react with javascript, no standards, no linting or type checking, first changes dating back to 2015. Codebase is editied by everything based on their needs, so you can image quality of the code.
 Converting to typescript is impossible due to scope and lack of human resources. Everyone in the team likes current setup and really not cares about improving. Mgnment wants me to improve everything (they don’t know what, they just want to be sure that project is up to these days standarts) and fix bugs that noone can fix. So naturally other devs are maximum junior-mid level.
 I feel like I am loosing my skills and this is my biggest worry. I am super afraid to become bad at coding after working in these kind of projects. I am literally abandoning typescript and good coding standarts. No one wants to do big improvements or changes, only me. Should I try to do something about it or better not waste my time and switch company? I have joined this company due to pay raise, but it feels like skills cut…

                              <span>I&#x27;m a fairly experienced dev with a broad knowledge so I tend to move around teams as needed. It&#x27;s kind of my thing and companies like it because I always work on top priorities.
 However this has exposed me to the fact that every single local build never ever works initially. Normally there are some docs slightly out of date, you follow them and error. Some unhappy container, undefined variables, some stuff that doesn&#x27;t install, unit tests won&#x27;t run.
 The only way to make it run is to fight through it during long several days of debugging, normally heavily assisted by someone in the team that has the right lore (normally this person is busy for the same reason so can only help here and there) 
 It kills me that in my 10 plus years I haven&#x27;t seen much progress in this part of the dev cycle. Docker was supposed to fix it but then we made stuff around docker complex. We have fancy complicated and fragil infra. Don&#x27;t get me started with stuff like bazel. When Mr bazel had enough and leaves the company, it becomes the &quot;we don&#x27;t know what that does so don&#x27;t touch it&quot; and it&#x27;s exactly where it will break when I&#x27;m trying to get up to speed. 
 Sorry a bit ranty. 
 Have I been unlucky in my career or have you seen this issue too? Have you found some strategies that solve or help with this?

                              <span>As far as I can tell most projects here are about consoles. I would like to know what could be a “relatively easy” old school computer to emulate with a difficulty similar to the DMG GameBoy.
 Please don’t suggest me the ZX spectrum or other Sinclair computers because those don’t have any kind of graphics chip or sound in many cases.
 I am more interested in suggestions around Commodore 64, Apple IIc, IBM XT or similar computers. 
 Thanks in advance.
 P.D. My real goal is to understand how much harder an old school computer emulator is compared to a GameBoy or NES emulator.
 I don’t know if I am being naive but the existence of family basic for the Nintendo Famicom leads me to believe that an old micro computer could be very similar to old consoles in term of emulation

 How do you ensure that your monitoring stack is working as expected and you didn&#x27;t messed up the config?
 If you&#x27;re using a Saas (Grafana cloud, datadog, whatever) do you have another solution that will alert you in case of an outage?
 Maybe it&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s no simple solution that&#x27;s worth the effort. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

                              <span>As someone who&#x27;s starting a CS internship soon, I&#x27;m curious as to what seasoned devs get annoyed by when working with interns. I think it would be interesting if the devs who&#x27;ve worked with interns vented about things they typically do that are bad, and us incoming interns can learn what not to do.

                              <span>In other careers (think law, finance, teaching) the more experienced you get the more your value and command over your work increases.
 But in software, things change so fast that you never really get to &#x27;expert&#x27; level, and always need to keep learning new things. 
 So how long do people usually keep this going? And does upskilling get challenging with age?
 I&#x27;ve rarely ever worked with engineers who were in their 50s or above, and the few I have worked with seemed like they did struggle.
 Is this a career for the young and not something you should plan to do for the rest of your life?

                              <span>Been in IT security for over 20 years, have been shopping around for my next job (am FT employed). Yes, you are right, the market sucks donkey ass.
 Jobs opening on my level (lead security architect, etc) - dozens of apps within hours as far as I can tell. Before I started my current job 5 years ago, I’d get recruiters trying to poach me every single day over LI.
 Also considering the fact that I’ll be pushing 50 soon makes the future looking very very bleak for me.
 Not even mentioning the pay — market has capped it on a level 5 years ago at least.

 He said Sorry we&#x27;re looking for backend developer and hung up on me.
 I knew the technical discrepancy between engineers and recruiters were there however I didn&#x27;t suppose the discrepancy could be this large.
 Edit: he might just wanted to hire pure backend developers but again there was no need throw full-stack developers out of the window, some full-stack developers are more backend focused (like me) than others.
 End rant.

 Hi everyone!
 I posted about Luminal a few months ago, and since then we&#x27;ve made significant progress in the CUDA and Metal compilers.
 For those who don&#x27;t know, Luminal is a a deep learning library that uses composable compilers to achieve high performance. It&#x27;s entirely written in Rust and orders of magnitude simpler than comparable ML frameworks.
 Recently we&#x27;ve been working on speeding up performance on Nvidia and Apple GPUs, which led us to write compilers capable of generating kernels on the fly. These kernels are compiled once and ran many times, and since the whole compute graph is known at compile time, we can get very aggressive with the kernel optimizations.
 We&#x27;re adding tons more features (autograd landed a few weeks ago, so training is now possible!) so check out the blog post and the repo if you&#x27;d like to know more!

                              <span>I really love working on Rust up until I have to add async to the mix. Lately I just avoid adding async at all costs because it just comes with so many caveats and gotchas that the effort is sometimes not worth the performance improvement. Some of the things that I absolutely find annoying:
  
async is not part of rust, it&#x27;s a library. The main one being Tokio with no real alternative. I applaud the work done on this but it all just feels horribly hacky. 
 
any time you have to use async you taint all your functions and types with it. As if dropping a bucket of paint (worse than paint but let&#x27;s keep it civil) all over your code. It makes refactoring a horrible experience. As you crawl your codebase to make it async you eventually end up with an impossible task and have to find ugly alternatives (looking at you async fn in traits)
 
while the rust compiler has been an amazing tool along the journey, it just fails miserably with async. It won&#x27;t complain at all if you forgot to remove a blocking fs call in an async context and of course it will fail horribly at run time. And when the program eventually crashes, it will just render the most obscure stacktrace i&#x27;ve ever seen. FAR from the developper experience of vanilla Rust.
 
 Overall for such a great language with so many features, it just feels broken as soon as you put your finger in the async business. I ve been looking at the async improvement proposals but apart from async fn traits, i just don&#x27;t see anything revolutionary that would make the experience better. 
 At some point, shouldn&#x27;t it just be part of the language if async Rust is to improve in a major way ? 
 Disclaimer: I am not a Rust expert, but i ve been programming for 25+ years in many different languages.

                              <span>This isnt technically rust related, but Gleam is a language written in rust and it&#x27;s very much inspired by rust. 
 As far as I know, it appears to be using rusts type system but with a GC. It might be a good fit for small projects where rust could be overkill. Or maybe as a scripting language.

                              <span>Why is this a problem? There are times when I am play testing a prototype and I can’t tell if what I am playing is fun or what I need to do to make it better. I thought this was perhaps just something that is exclusive to the games I am making. So I boot up some games in my backlog, games I haven’t played yet. No luck there. So I boot up some games I played in the past, games that I loved, no luck either. I am a solo game developer, so there’s no escaping the play testing phase. Does anyone else have this problem? Did you ever manage to figure out how to solve this? If you didn’t I would love to hear what you pivot your career to.

                              <span>I created a mod and run a server for a game and just received a DMCA takedown from my server&#x27;s hosting company on behalf of a company which runs a similar, standalone game. The DMCA takedown request has images of the &quot;infringing works&quot; but all of the claimed assets are from different mod from the same game that my mod is for, none of those assets are in my mod or hosted on my server.
 My hosting company has given me two options: 1) remove the infringing content or 2) reply with a valid DMCA counter-notice and wait 10 days. My problem is that I have no infringing content to remove and I don&#x27;t want to wait 10 days to bring my server back online.
 Has anyone dealt with false DMCA takedown requests? I would like to be transparent and publicly post the full DMCA request and evidence for my community so they can know what is going on and see that we have infringed on nothing. Is this worth getting a lawyer for? This is a hobby project that doesn&#x27;t take donations so paying thousands of dollars for a lawyer isn&#x27;t an option.
 Thanks.

 I&#x27;m 7 years into this. I want to exit at 10 years to do something else after paying off my home - paying off the home so that I can afford to go down in income. 
 Right now I&#x27;m balancing my full time job with my side gig that I&#x27;d like to eventually transition to a full time gig. 
 Anyone else doing this? So many people want to transition into tech that I feel like I hear fewer stories of seasoned tech employees transitioning out of tech, though I know it must be a thing and I am not the only one.

 I&#x27;m gonna have a system design round with a company that boasts that they expect their EMs+ to be technically as good as a Staff+ Engineers (only from system design ability POV). I know this might seem weird but please kindly ignore this. I&#x27;m not worried.
 Now that brings me to the title. 
 If you&#x27;re someone who does system design interviews for Staff+ positions, what are the reasons you reject them? 
 Assume the scenario where the candidate thinks it went well. Yet you looked for some important things and you reject them. Why?

                              <span>I just went to start our biweekly meeting on a major branch of our product, and a coworker juts in and kicks it off themselves instead, saying everything has been reprioritized. They apparently had a random in-person meeting with the superior behind my back where they talked status and prioritization. There was no outreach or status inquiry on my end as the lead.
 I don&#x27;t really know how else to take it. Seems not random to me, and it feels like I&#x27;m getting edged out for some reason.
 Have you guys had something like this happen before? Should I position one way or another in response to this?
 I&#x27;ve always ran the meeting in the past, and we&#x27;re ahead of schedule. It just seems weird that they&#x27;ve taken the reigns and spoken in my place when I was the lead on it. Maybe I&#x27;m reading into it but it seems pretty blatant.

 tl;dr some revisions to the rules to reduce low quality blogspam. The most notable are: banning listicles (&quot;7 cool things I copy-pasted from somebody else!&quot;), extreme beginner articles (&quot;how to use a for loop&quot;), and some limitations on career posts (they must be related to programming careers). Lastly, I want feedback on these changes and the subreddit in general and invite you to vote and use the report button when you see posts that violate the rules because they&#x27;ll help us get to it faster.
 r/programming&#x27;s mission is to be the place with the highest quality programming content, where I can go to read something interesting and learn something new every day. Last time we spoke I introduced the rules that we&#x27;ve been moderating by to accomplish that. Subjectively, …</span>

                              <span>I would like to have and idea of how much harder an emulator for the original GameBoy is compared with the Space Invaders arcade. Is the GameBoy too hard as project after chip8? Or is Sapce Invaders the way to go? What are the main issues I might encounter? 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I am writing a C64 emulator as my first real emulator project after CHIP 8. As of now I have implemented the CPU, bank switching and rendering the screen memory. 
 I loaded up the character, basic and kernal roms and it expectedly didn&#x27;t work right away. I fixed a couple of bugs but it still doesn&#x27;t work and I feel stuck.
 The code seems to execute normally but at some point it enters this section of code and it is stuck in this loop infinitely: 
 ramtz1 inc tmp0+1 ;move index thru memory ramtz2 lda (tmp0),y ;get present data tax ;save in .x lda #$55 ;do a $55,$aa test sta (tmp0),y cmp (tmp0),y bne size rol a sta (tmp0),y cmp (tmp0),y bne size txa ;restore old data sta (tmp0),y iny bne ramtz2 beq ramtz1 
 It seems to me that the bne size instructions are the only way out of the loop, but I dont get how they would ever trigger. It stores the accumulator value into memory and then just compares the accumulator against the the memory location the accumulator was just stored in. How are they ever not equal?
 I must be missing something.

                              <span>In a regular cgb game, can I rely on the fact that there should be a return for each call? or are there circumstances where the code manually pushes an address to the stack in order to use it as a return address? Because I&#x27;m currently counting the different calls and returns during execution and there sometimes seem to be more returns than calls (??)
 The occurrences I&#x27;m counting are:
 RET, conditional RET and RETI
 vs.
 CALL, conditional CALL, RST and whenever an Interrupt Handler gets called

                              <span>Hi, 
 I am very new to emu dev and this is my first C++ project, and I am having some trouble getting the basic IBM CHIP8 rom to work. I&#x27;ve linked the repository below to see if someone can tell what is wrong. If you simply compile the program then run &quot;./build/debug/emu roms/ibm.ch8&quot; it should run and show the output. Some of my code is from other projects on the internet and some I wrote myself, but I&#x27;m trying to identify what is not allowing it to work correctly. In my execute cycle, I am only running the opcode functions that are required for the IBM rom to make debugging easier. Thank you to anyone who can help.
