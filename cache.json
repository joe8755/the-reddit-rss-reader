          "description": "I created a simple REPL in C that reads a line of input and prints it back, while saving the history of inputs entered by the user. Before you judge me as a noob (I don't mind that tbh), listen.\n Why create a stupid REPL?\n Well, creating a basic REPL that reads input until the user hits ENTER is straightforward. However, allowing the user to navigate through input history with the UP and DOWN arrow keys is more challenging because:\n  \nImmediate Input Handling: You don't get what the user typed until they hit ENTER. This is problematic because users expect the previous command to be displayed immediately upon pressing the UP arrow key.\n Raw Mode and Escape Sequences: To handle user input on each key press, the terminal input must be in raw mode. And once you're in raw mode, say bye bye to the default behavior of the terminal like CTRL+C to exit, CTRL+D to send EOF, or something as simple as backspace handling. You have to handle all of these manually. In fact, you have to responsible for writing back the character that the user types to the terminal.\n  \nYou can read more about raw mode and escape sequences in my notes:\n  \nRaw mode: https://github.com/biraj21/echo-repl/blob/main/notes/raw-mode.md\n Escape sequences: https://github.com/biraj21/echo-repl/blob/main/notes/escape-sequences.md\n  \nBtw this stupid REPL is roughly 500 lines of (probably buggy) code!\n Source code: https://github.com/biraj21/echo-repl\n Please go through the README once to understand the behaviour of history in this implementation.\n Motivation? Needed it to follow https://buildyourownlisp.com/ book, and I was unable to build the library suggested there on my Mac.\n Would appreciate your feedback.

I've been learning c for some time and I recently had a project idea that might make me slightly better at using C if I implemented some ml algos. So I was thinking of making a decision tree clustering algorithm, where I'll substitute the criterion for measuring the variance with the f score and then use that for clustering algorithm. Just some idea had when I was studying decison trees and I wanna see if it works. \n Is it even feasible? What approaches would you try? How can I do matrix multiplications and additions? Will I have to use the c for loops for that sort of thing, or is there a library for optimising the additions?\n    submitted by    /u/high_dead_man  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm working in embedded C. The device receives ascii text one character at a time over a serial port and I would like to recognize when certain regex patterns appear in the stream. The character rate is highly variable and there are other tasks to perform, so I can't simply block on the serial port and collect data as a string.\n What I want is something like PEARL with various rules and actions, but with a one-char-at-a-time input. And it has to play nice with other round-robin tasks.\n The goal would be to do something like stringRecognizer() in the code below. The pattern rules would be regex that are pre-compiled by the lex-generator for (e.g.) recognizing the strings \"CAT\", \"DOG\" and \"PIG\" and returning an appropriate enum value that would trigger an action.\n The function is stateful, so it knows if it has seen (e.g.) C and then A, so a subsequent T would return ACTION_CAT but an R (or anything else) would return ACTION_NOT_DONE and move on. A D would also return ACTION_NOT_DONE but move the state into the DOG rule (so CADOG would eventually trigger the DOG rule). There might be a rule to reset the state machine when a new-line or carriage-return is seen.\n I've looked at lex, flex and re2c but none provides a stateful pattern recognizer. In all cases the state machine pulls data from either a string or an input stream, but is otherwise fully blocking. When the lex() function returns (to main()) all state is lost and restarts when a new string is supplied.\n while(1) { doTask1(); // blink led doTask2(); // read a sensor if (serialInputHasData()) { char c = getch(); action_t action = stringRecognizer(c); switch(action) { case ACTION_CAT: doCatFunction(); break; case ACTION_DOG: doDogFunction(); break; case ACTION_PIG: doPigFunction(); break; case ACTION_NOT_DONE: break; default: break; } } } \n    submitted by    /u/somewhereAtC  \n [link]   [comments]",

(Impossible)\n Sorry for bad hand writing. The idea is simple something like this:\n We give each other our public keys. You and me accomplish for two numbers (pre-partial-numbers that produce the pre-chain) and then we give each other their encrypted versions and then we have the final-chain (the protocol and client software can have common sorting and hashing as a reducer function... for example into a game card) After all each client software verifies the final chain with public keys of each peer and each peer will ensure that their pre-partial numbers are there inside and it is making the chaos for randomness because the common hasher/reducer function's hash is gonna be unpredictable.\n The fact that's providing this is that when peers encrypt their pre-partial-numbers with their private keys (RSA) there is no any pattern between them to predict and break the protocol safety. (Or there is? Idk.)\n If this whole thing is not bullshit, I will implement it in my game server.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/EvrenselKisilik  \n [link]   [comments]",

The election processes do indeed finish, upon which point the coordinator process (rank n-1) sends out the ST leader to all GS processes and the GS leader to all ST processes respectively.\n Everything works fine for the ST election and message passing, but for some reason, when the coordinator sends out the GS_ELECT event to all ST processes after the GS leader election, the ST processes do not receive the event. I tried logging the probe's tag, and it is just always START_LELECT_ST and no matter what event is sent afterward, it just never changes the status of the probe, neither with GS_LEADER nor with TERMINATE.\n The relevant ST receiving part is on line 200 of the pastebin source code. I am busting my head trying to figure out why this is happening since if I am not mistaken, MPI_Probe and MPI_Iprobe should be seeing the pending new events and grabbing their tags.\n Any help is greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Najishukai  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all. So, as a challenge to myself to actually start doing projects in C, I decided to make a ncurses-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Part of the logic involves storing the current state in one matrix, and using that to build a second matrix for the next generation's state. Each cycle, the 'next state' (we'll call it m2) becomes the 'previous state' (m1), and my first implementation simply involved looping through the matrices and overwriting each cell of m1 with the corresponding cell of m2. While this works fine, I wanted to do it more \"optimally\" by simply swapping two pointer addresses. This is the function that I came up with:\n void swap_ptr(int (**p1)[ROWS][COLS], int (**p2)[ROWS][COLS]) { int (*tmp)[ROWS][COLS] = *p1; *p1 = *p2; *p2 = tmp; return; } \n The implementation looks like this:\n int matrix1[ROWS][COLS]; int matrix2[ROWS][COLS]; int (*m1)[ROWS][COLS] = &matrix1; int (*m2)[ROWS][COLS] = &matrix2; /* main loop starts, insert Life logic here to populate m2 based on the contents of m1*/ display(*m2); swap_ptr(&m1, &m2); \n This appears to be working fine, but it's not at all like the methods I found online for the same thing, which instead called for something more like:\n void swap_ptr(int ***p1, int ***p2); \n Is there something wrong with the way I'm doing it, or is this just one of those funny C things where there's multiple \"correct\" ways to do something? Thanks in advance!\n EDIT: fixed typos in my code examples.\n    submitted by    /u/XineOP  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming using Java, as well as web and mobile development with technologies like React and Node.js.\n While I consider myself proficient in developing products, I’m aware that the rise of workflow automation might impact the relevance of some skills I currently possess. To stay ahead, I’m planning to deepen my expertise in C programming and explore branches such as embedded programming and advanced uses of C/C++.\n I have a decent handle on solving LeetCode problems and a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms. However, I aim to achieve a deeper understanding of programming and want to have skills that can make me a better developer and a valuable employee.\n I’m here to ask for advice and pointers from those with more experience. Should I focus on C/C++ for embedded systems, or are there other areas within systems programming I should consider? I am also taking a Computer Systems course on the side. I appreciate all the feedbacks I can get - roadmaps, youtube series, project ideas, literally anything.

The error can contain an enum so the specific errors can be resolved in code, and a char* to a descriptive error message for easier debugging. What do you think? Do you use something similar, or have a better way of handling errors?\n Here's some example code which can be run in godbolt:\n ​\n #include <stdlib.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdbool.h> #define _STRINGIFY(x) #x #define STRINGIFY(x) _STRINGIFY(x) #define ERROR_STRING(string_literal) \"ERROR in \"__FILE__ \" line #\" STRINGIFY(__LINE__) string_literal typedef struct { bool is_error; union { struct { enum {MakeEggs_error_TemperatureLow, MakeEggs_error_…",

          "description": "I am reading the book \"The C Programming Language,\" an amazing book by the way. In the last chapter about the Unix system, there is a part about building the fopen function with system calls. In this, we use some kind of internal flags, for example, _READ instead of O_RDONLY. In the implementation, it uses both the POSIX and the internal flags. As I understand it, it uses both because in order to detect if some FILE has write privileges, for example, you can intersect bits, and if the intersection is different than 0, it has the privilege. However, this breaks when using O_RDONLY because it has the value 0, so it is not possible to detect if a combination of flags has the O_RDONLY flag with this aproach.\n So my question is, why does POSIX start with 0 instead of 1 and shift the rest by 2*n?\n (Maybe the answer is obvious, but I don't see it.)\n    submitted by    /u/vaquitson  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I have some prior programming experience with C and Python but never managed to go pass the basics. Hopefully I will get to a point where I can do something useful with these languages around this time)\n Nonetheless, I am following the classic \"The C Programming Language\" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. In the introductory chapter (A TUTORIAL INTRODUCTION - Page 6), the first example to print Hello World goes something like this:\n # include <stdio.h> main () { printf(\"Hello, world\\n\"); } \n When I compiled it with the cc or gcc compiler, an error was produced:\n error: return type defaults to 'int' \n Naturally, I went back to the thought process that I had in my previous attempts at learning C. I simply declared the return type for the main() function to be void and it compiled successfully. The changed code goes like this:\n # include <stdio.h> void main () { printf(\"Hello, world\\n\"); } \n What am I missing out from the example?

Or does this question not make sense in this language and is this approach fundamentally wrong?\n #include <iostream> #include <string> using namespace std; class Fruit { string name; string color; public: Fruit (string n, string c) { setName(n); setColor(c); }; void setName(string s) {name = s; return;}; string getName() {return name;}; void setColor(string s) {color = s; return;}; string getColor() {return color;}; }; Fruit* a = new Fruit(\"apple\", \"red\"); Fruit* b = new Fruit(\"banana\", \"yellow\"); int main() { Fruit currentFruit = (*a); bool keepGoing = true; while (keepGoing) { cout << \"\\nthe current fruit is \" << currentFruit.getName() << endl; cout << \"\\nit is \" << currentFruit.getColor() << endl; string newColor; cin >> newColor; currentFruit.setColor(newColor); cout << \"\\nokay, now \"<< currentFruit.getName() << \" is \"; cout << currentFruit.getColor() << endl; if (currentFruit.getName() == \"apple\") { currentFruit = (*b); } else { currentFruit = (*a); } } return 0; } \n    submitted by    /u/MetalKev    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As you know, one of the main gripes with C++ development is related to compilation time. Compiler vendors constantly strive to make improvements in this area, in spite of new STL features being constantly added. C++26 is going to be quite special in this regard though afaik, having the reflections proposal accepted. Reflections being probably the biggest metaprogramming extensions ever added to the language, even bigger than concepts and require clauses.\n I'm saying this because I was watching this particular talk by Alexander Fokin describing it: https://youtu.be/FqzrQf6Xr8g?si=oe6L0askoOzQjSlC&t=3592 . What immediately caught my attention was the example of how you could implement std::tuple (almost fully) in what? 20 lines of code? For reference, MSVC's implementation is a header with more than 1000 lines of code ( https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/main/stl/inc/tuple ), containing dozens of helper class template instantiated for each instance of std::tuple used in real code. A fair assumption would be that the std::meta version would be far faster to compile, reflections being a very straight-forward way of expressing your intent to the compiler. In real life scenarios this could results in an immense amount of time saved at compilation time. And better yet, the opportunity of rewritting std::tuple would be a big bonus too since none of the standard implementations are optimal ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ilujab/it_turns_out_stdtuple_is_not_a_zerocost/ ).\n Again, I'm not talking just about std::tuple here, I'm assuming there are dozens of STL components that could use being rewritten using reflections, if for nothing else, at least for the sake of compilation time. I'm wondering if this new feature couldn't be the push vendors have needed to take into consideration a real ABI break with one of their future releases, considering the compilation time improvements now available on the table. \n    submitted by    /u/cristi1990an    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

To me it seems obvious what it should expand to, for example if Is = 0, 1 and Tuples = Tuple1, Tuple2, Tuple3, then it should expand to:\n std::is_void_v<invoke_at_result_t<0, F, Tuple1, Tuple2, Tuple3>> || std::is_void_v<invoke_at_result_t<1, F, Tuple1, Tuple2, Tuple3>> \n It is stranger that the code compiles with Clang or GCC. What's even more stranger is when I refactor it\n template <class F, std::size_t... Is, class... Tuples> constexpr bool tuple_void_output = (std::is_void_v<invoke_at_result_t<Is, F, Tuples...>> || ...); \n and then use it as\n else if constexpr (tuple_void_output<F, Is..., Tuples...>) \n then it also works in MSVC (you can change the define from 0 to 1 to activate this refactoring in the godbolt link). My IDE (CLion) is giving red squiggles though with messages:\n  \nFor the definition of tuple_void_output \"Template parameter pack must be the last template parameter\"\n When instantiating the template variable: \"Template argument for non-type template parameter must be an expression\"\n  \nSo my questions:\n  \nIs there something wrong with my code?\n Which compiler is correct?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/SimonMarynissen    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please tell me it is restricted.\n  \nI'm currently working for porting existing libraries like magic_enum, fastgltf and etc (which are used in my private module based projects). Changing dependencies with module is quite easy and giving me much benefits for compile time.\n During porting, I'm curious about which folder is the proper location for module port file (which ends with .cppm or .ixx extensions). At first I think src or module is the answer, because it is not header file and cannot be included. However, I realized that package managers like vcpkg does not install files in those folders, but compile the sources files to static/shared libraries (which ends with .a or .so extensions).\n Some module supporting libraries like Vulkan-Hpp and glm locates the module file in include directory. In this case, vcpkg install the header files to include directory and user can fetch them using ${glm_SOURCE_DIR}/include/glm/glm.cppm to declare module target.\n There are many package managing strategies that are preserving file structures, but I think CMake + vcpkg is the de facto system for C++ developers, so I'm confusing about the proper module exposing method.

I've also written templates that can autogenerate Protobuf converters that convert a C++ message object to its protobuf equivalent. This has been super handy for us because we work with many different C++ message classes and hand typing all the converters would be tedious and error prone. \n My question is: I am debating making this tool open source, but want to see if other people who write C++ encounter similar problems to this and if a tool like this would be valuable and helpful before I spent a bunch of time re-working it and making it available on GitHub. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ndelgado1    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Log function essentially does this:\n std::cout << std::format(\"{}\\t\\t{}\\n\", LogTypeToString(type), vformat(fmt, args));\n The displaying of the text:\n constexpr auto renderTextSize = sizeof(renderer); Log(LogType::Info, \"{:*^{}} OpenGL Information {:*^{}}\", \"\", 16 + renderTextSize, \"\", 16 + renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, \"* Version : {} ({}.{}) {:{}} *\", version, glVersion[0], glVersion[1], \"\", 26 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, \"* Vendor : {:{}} *\", vendor, 52 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, \"* Renderer : {:{}} *\", renderer, renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, \"* GLSL Version : {:{}} *\", glslVersion, 52 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, \"{:*^{}}\", \"\", 76 - renderTextSize); \n As you may see, since the renderer text seems to be the longest by nature I'm trying to use that as the complete width so that this box shape using \"*\" is always just a space ahead and everything else meets it. I got it to look good with my settings, but I'm wondering how it would look if my information was different. Something tells me it wouldn't make a nice box.\n  \n[Info] ************************* OpenGL Information **************\n [Info] * Version : 4.6.0 NVIDIA 552.22 (4.6)\n [Info] * Vendor : NVIDIA Corporation\n [Info] * Renderer : NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Laptop GPU/PCIe/SSE2 * [Info] * GLSL Version : 4.60 NVIDIA [Info] **********************************************************\n  \nEDIT: It's hard to get it to display here, but basically the first line makes as many \"*\" to the length of the Renderer: text.

          "description": "For context: I am an electronics engineer by education and practice, but I switched to full time software development in 2016.\n By far, C and C++ has been most of my career. Dangerous languages perhaps, but languages that know they are dangerous, and document exactly where the sharp edges are located.\n However, for about a year and a half, I've been branching out and it appears to me that every single language and technology I look at has behaviors that are not defined. They just don't admit to it.\n I opened an issue in docker's documentation because they were missing an explanation for a behavior. Closed as resolved with, paraphrased, \"read the repository if you want to know how docker works.\"\n By that standard, C++ doesn't have undefined behavior either! Just read your compiler's source code and you'll know what happens.\n Same problem with Microsoft's Azure cloud services. Many guides and tutorials but no authoritative source that explains how Azure works, what each option does, and how they interact - or if there is, it's sufficiently burrowed that I've been unable to find it after searching for a while, and their representatives cannot guide me to it either. Dotnet projects? Same issue again, there's any number of properties you can set for your project and you just have to guess from their name what they will do - and don't get me started on the difficulty of writing provably correct golang.\n  \nI can sign for the correctness of C/C++ software. I might be wrong because mistakes happen, but those are mistakes, not lies.\n I cannot sign off on most other software. If I claim that I know something is correct, I am lying. I don't know. I'm guessing. \"It worked so far.\"\n  \nI can write software in all these languages, use all these other technologies. I cannot do engineering with them. I wish I could.\n    submitted by    /u/SoerenNissen    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I'm getting to know std::unordered_map and std::map and they seem be extremely useful in this cases since they store elements as key-value pairs.

This is 10x simpler than C++ as this removes 7 keywords consteval, constinit, constexpr, concept, requires, template and typename. This introduces one new keyword _. Besides few others are introduced but those could be considered as same as older ones e.g. if1 and for1 have similar semantics to if and for. Besides, this removes macros and has reflection. Libraries like CTRE and serialization of any kind would become tremendously easy to achieve in this.\n But I have a feeling that semantics are incorrect and it is not what it appears to be. Please help me find out my mistake.\n This is an incomplete specification and only discusses language semantics from generics and reflection perspective and does not consider other aspects of the programming language.\n Please share your thoughts. https://github.com/HassanSajjad-302/3Rus/tree/0.1\n    submitted by    /u/HassanSajjad302    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

People say QT is great because it's very fast and has lots of features, but the licensing model makes me a bit uneasy. If I had to some day, how much would I be able to do with just LGPL components?\n GTK is cross platform, but it seems native look is not a priority for them. This leads to strange inconsistencies in different UIs which might confuse users. Is GTK still the best option for performance reasons? Or does QT have better performance too?\n Finally there's wxWidgets. They compile to native toolkits on every platform, so it's probably the best for native look and feel. But is there a performance overhead because of the bindings and platform specific stuff?\n What does everyone think?\n Edit: I thought of another potential advantage of GTK: It has Rust bindings.

          "description": "I have been working with a pretty ancient windows desktop application whose initial release date predates me. Its development team recently wrapped some of its functionality as an unmanaged dll for us so that we can incorporate it into our aspnet based microservice application. Currently we are using .net's foreign function interface (PInvoke) to call the library, however it is a bit fragile and we have to meet a few odd requirements like using a thread with a non-standard max stack size.\n I am thinking maybe I should wrap the api calls in a separate program (probably written in c++) to execute c++ calls that I will run in a separate process and use ipc to communicate. This will probably be a bit more robust as I can recover from process crashes and do not need to implement a producer/consumer queue with a separate thread etc. to schedule api calls. However I also feel like I am overcomplicating things. Did any of you had to deal with a similar problem? If so, got any recommendations?\n    submitted by    /u/outoftunediapason    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a global struct with a few containers for each asset type and then a load function for each asset type ``` struct Assets { std::map<size_t, Model> models; std::map<size_t, Texture> textures; std::map<size_t, ShaderProgram> shaders; };\n ShaderProgram loadShader(Assets& assets, const std::string& vertexPath, const std::string& fragmentPath); Model loadModel(Assets& assets, const std::string& filePath); Texture loadTexture(Assets& assets, const char* filePath);\n ``` These functions hash the filepath (which is the new thing I was trying out) to use as a unique id and then if not already loaded loads it and returns the asset. I believe everything is being copied right now so I'm not working with the original object which causes them to constantly be deleted and not be rendered on screen so to fix this I just need the maps to store a smart pointer and the load functions return a smart pointer?\n For future reference is there a way to remember this sort of stuff for example whenever an object is needed outside the scope should I be working with pointers?\n    submitted by    /u/Konjointed    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I thought I'd share it here for anyone interested: https://dma-neves.github.io/dma/raptor.html\n Raptor offers similar performance and capabilities to thrust, but offers a more abstract interface. Raptor provides a set of smart containers (vector, array, vector, scalar) and skeletons (map, reduce, scan, filter, sort) that can be applied over the smart containers. Containers can store the data both on the host (CPU) and device (GPU), and expose a seemingly unified memory address space. Skeletons are executed on the device. Containers are automatically and lazily allocated and synchronized whenever a skeleton is executed.\n    submitted by    /u/dma_snow    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So it is fully possible to use #define with parenthesis to, for instance, make a an add \"function\" like this:\n #define ADD(x, y) ((x) + (y)) void foo() { std::cout << ADD(3, 7) << std::endl; } \n My first question here, is this good or bad C++ practice? I've heard that \"macros are evil\" but don't fully understand why or what it even means.\n On the the real question of the post, is it possible to use #define with curly brackets? I might give some of you a heart attack now so let's just view this as an example. Is it possible to do something like this:\n #define private_namespace{a} namespace{a} private_namespace{ void some_function() {...} int some_other_function() {...} } \n In this case you might say \"Why not just write #define private_namespace namespace?\" to which my answer is a) this is more of a hypothetical question for learning purposes and b) then the coder could write private_namespace some_namespace {...} instead of namespace some_namespace {...}.\n    submitted by    /u/LemonLord7    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I'm pretty new to cpp and am trying to work out the best design for a problem I'm having. I'm wondering if shared pointers are the way to go. \n The problem: I have a class that makes an expensive database query during construction. The information retrieved is static though and most of the class functions don't even depend on the data. Furthermore, a class instance might be constructed multiple times during a single call from the upstream application , and each time this expensive and often unnecessary db call is made.\n My idea: Lazy load the db query only when it's first needed and then store the data in a global cache that will exist for the entirety of the application call. I can't control if 10 instances of this class are created, but I can limit to a single db call instead of 10. \n Is a shared pointer amongst the class instances a feasible and a solution here? My understanding is that the a shared pointer to the cache will keep it alive as I need, but I'm unsure how to pass a pointer between the instances like this. I'm also wondering if I'm overthinking the problem and there is a simpler solution I'm not considering. I'd appreciate any advice or insight, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/epicmouse77    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I'm on the hunt for a linear algebra library that implements the upcoming std::linalg standard from C++26 (details here). Given that the standard will likely not be widely supported by compilers until around 2030, I'm interested in using a library that aligns with std::linalg now. This would allow for a seamless transition to std::linalg once it becomes broadly available. \n So far, I haven’t found a library that meets these criteria. I did come across this post, but it wasn’t quite what I needed. If anyone knows of a library that fits this description, I would really appreciate your recommendations.\n Additionally, if anyone is aware of a wrapper for any established libraries like Eigen, Armadillo, BLAS, LAPACK, xtensor, or Blaze that adapts their functionality to align with the proposed std::linalg standard in C++26, I’d be very interested in learning about it. Such a wrapper would ideally allow for easier migration to std::linalg when it becomes standard. Please share any leads or resources you might have.\n Thanks in advance for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/loumalouomega    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone.\n I’m relatively new to C++ and have a project im working on. The basis of the project is a basketball game where randomized players and their stats are generated through a draft system then stored into multiple text files. \n I have correlated the players and their attributes using array positions. I have the system set up correctly where I can write the data to the text file and read from it but I am unable to run the code unless I manually go and delete the info from the text file. Only when I do this do the errors disappear.\n It defeats the point if the players stats are not able to be retrieved the first time they were drafted in the game, as I want to be able to implement a save feature where you can pick up where you left off. I have implemented this by creating a main menu, with a switch function, allowing a player to either reset their data by truncating the text files, and undergo the draft process all over again, or continue with the information already in the text file. The issue is however, as I said before, I cannot run this without deleting the data in the file, which I do not want the player to have to do unless they want to reset the game.\n The errors themselves are 2 C2059 errors and Expected a Declaration in the text file themself, which confused me.\n LINK: https://github.com/kvtrey5/BASKETBALL-GAME\n    submitted by    /u/isjupiteramoon    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Post graduation I didn’t have anything lined up, so during the summer I worked as a bag boy at a local golf course, then eventually went back to a broker I interned for to work as an office assistant part time all while I continued to job search. Sent out hundreds of applications and got interviews here and there, but no luck getting hired. It was honestly such a draining experience. I couldn’t even get hired for a position paying 45-50k a year and a lot of them were customer service based roles, very entry level. Fast forward to now, I got hired to be an ‘engineer’ but the role is more so a project management role. Absolutely no experience in the field and they are willing to train me. One thing I learned about obtaining a job is it’s all about who you know and if the timing is right. The guy whos position I am taking over got promoted and I happen to know someone within the company which definitely helped. One in-person interview and three weeks later they sent me an offer, which definitely caught me off guard.

They are focused on quality, they care about the software and where it is going. Non-technical managers want things done in X amount of time and you need to explain to them like they’re 5 why it hasn’t been done yet. \n How am I supposed to respect someone and essentially report to them when they know nothing about technology? \n These are roles to whip the employees to work harder, slaves overlooking other slaves. They’re there to force devs to give themselves deadlines and burn themselves out. \n Yes, there are also technical managers who aren’t good managers. Imo you need to be both good at management and good at technology, if you’re good at just one of these, you’re automatically not good enough. Your lack in the other area will show up. The definition of a leader, to me, is someone you look up to, who can do at least everything that you do and more. \n This industry is a bit of a joke, not surprised that people can’t take us seriously when we call ourselves “engineers”. It seems like everyone who knows how to send an email and takes one course can come in and start managing projects. No wonder this industry is flooded and sinking. \n    submitted by    /u/pinkbutterfly22  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I've been interviewing quite a few people recently for a remote role and noticed most don't bother turning on their camera. It's a bit awkward but I decided to keep mine on anyway.\n Is this very common in your experience?\n I assume they might do it for bias reasons (definitely had women not wanting to get judged because of their appearance and I get that from what I've seen in our field) or just don't feel like it. I didn't push for it as I generally tend to have my team decide by themselves if they turn their camera on during meetings and glad to do as much as possible in Slack. But for a first time meeting people I still find it super hard to... bond with them and then later tell them apart. Or even hire someone without ever having seen their face once.\n Last time I interviewed people for my team a few years ago I didn't notice this, most just seemed to turn on the cam without having it explicitly stated.\n EDIT: \n For the next rounds I'll definitely see that I explicitly state \"video call\". I was just surprised people don't do this by default but perhaps I'm just becoming boomer :). But there's a \"give a talk and we discuss\" round anyway, so I hope at least there they'll turn their cam on.\n I should probably add, this is for a very senior/scientific role, so we also have to meet customers at least virtually, pitch projects, give talks, hold webinars, perhaps go to a conference etc.\n    submitted by    /u/met0xff  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So recently I decided I was going to replace my LinkedIn profile pic since my current one is outdated. While I hadn't yet replaced it I left it blank and suddenly received 2 unsolicited messages from recruiters and 2 responses from other job listings in the span of 1 week. For context, I had spent 6 months and ~800 job apps which I know isn't that many but I haven't even gotten a phone screen. My last and only interview was 6 months ago, where I made it to the final round and was rejected because they had an applicant with more experience than me (I had over 2 YOE and it was a junior role FML). \n Anyway I'm starting to question the timing of these recruiter messages. I don't think there was anything wrong with my profile picture. The only critique I could think of is that it was a bit outdated so I might have looked too young. I don't really want this to turn into a r/RoastMe post so just bear with me and assume I am just an average looking person. \n I think the more likely scenario is that there is some algorithm that LinkedIn uses that detects when users become less engaged on the platform and then decides to rapidly promote that user into reengaging again. This may come across as tinfoil hatty but I do think this is the most likely outcome since the timing does not make any sense and I haven't read anything to suggest the job market suddenly improved a ton. I am curious if other people have had similar things happen to them like this.\n Also an FYI I am a White Male U.S. Citizen with 2.5 YOE in a popular tech stack in a west coast city. \n    submitted by    /u/nysoxfan01  \n [link]   [comments]",

It’s hard for me to personally justify being a part of such a huge class divide. \n Edit: guys I’m not saying juniors are getting paid that. That’s an example of my friend who sent from senior to staff. It’s just an example of “person getting paid 6 figures leaves job to get paid slightly more 6 figures” and how casual it is would be unfathomable to most Americans, and you’re all showing how out of touch you are by ignoring the point and focusing on the numbers lmao.\n I’m not blaming anyone who jumps jobs (I wish we could hop jobs all the time it’s our right as workers) I’m just curious to have a discussion if anyone else feels the same.

While previous projects have brought many games to a playable state over the years, many audio and visual effects end up getting lost lost in translation. With these recops projects, were now able to get fully intact ports of these games in all their glory with plenty of enhancements as well.\n  \nZelda64 Recomp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywWwUuWRgsM\n  \nWith there now being a healthy interest for N64 from both fans and developers regarding these recent projects, it got me thinking about other consoles such as the OG Xbox and Sega Saturn that also have a troubled history with emulation progress over the years. How cool would it be to have decomp/recomp projects for games like Jet Set Radio Future and Panzer Dragoon Orta?\n For those of you with experience working on such consoles, how feasible do you see this?

          "description": "Hi, I'm planning to start adding audio rendering into my Gameboy emulator and have a few questions:\n  \nFor some background, my emulator assumes that all devices will be clocked every machine cycle (70224 cycles/frame). So, I'm using that clock to determine when to generate the next audio sample. Is there a better way to do this?\n Currently I generate an entire frame of audio data and then sending that data to SDL when it renders the video frame (~60 audio frames/sec). But I'm having issues finding a good sample rate that divisible by the machine cycles. I did find 264 machine cycles/audio sample, which gives 266 audio samples/frame -> 15,960 audio samples/sec. But this doesn't seem optimal. Any suggestions on how I could improve this?\n  \nEdit: Fixed units in 1. from cycles/sec -> cycles/frame\n    submitted by    /u/dajolly  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi. I want to write my own NES \"cartridge decoder\" that will serve as a helper tool during development of my NES emulator. One of it's capabilities will be dissasembly of a PRG ROM. However the thing with these ROMs is that data is mixed up with the code and it can look roughly like this:\n <some data>\n <couple of instructions>\n <some data>\n <couple of instructions> \n And etc. So if you are looking at compiled binary you really have no way of telling whether given byte is treated as instruction, instruction operand (or part of it) or data used by the program.\n I came up with 2 approaches how I could tackle this:\n  \nLazy approach - Just interpret everything as instruction (of course by taking their variable length into account)\n Better approach - Interpret the program, not exactly by executing it but going instruction by instruction, tracking where it jumps or which subroutines it calls. While processing branch instructions process both cases. Read interrupt vectors and interpret them as well until reaching RTS instruction. Everything else would be considered raw data and dead code would also fall into that category. Basically disassembler would go instruction by instruction to determine where code execution can lead to distinguish instructions from the data.\n  \nI never specifically wrote a dissasembler, so I would like to know if my ideas are at least good, or there are better, more reliable approaches to that out there.\n    submitted by    /u/Sea-Work-173  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm really excited about this because observability SDKs have traditionally used proprietary schemas, making it hard to export and analyze production data.\n Our mobile-native SDKs use OpenTelemetry Traces and Logs, and capture mobile-specific signals such as network requests, status codes, screen views, error logs, crashes, and more.\n Here’s our github repo: https://github.com/embrace-io\n You can use a generic OTel exporter to send mobile telemetry captured by our SDK to any OTel backend like Jaeger, Zipkin, or Grafana, or send it to Embrace itself. Plus, we’re enabling mobile teams to instrument any software component or service using OpenTelemetry and gather the data in the Embrace backend. This data can be visualized and live alongside data captured by first-party solutions.\n Full disclosure: I work for Embrace.io but would really appreciate your thoughts and feedback\n    submitted by    /u/go4johnny  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have revamped the entire infrastructure of my (medium sized - multi million) company, terraforming the infrastructure, managing and improving deployments, improved kubernetes, docker images, pipelines, etc…\n Now my company hired 3 new devops engineers for a different company because they are cheaper but s the tasks go to them.

I have a few services to run, so I’m looking for advice.\n There’s the app built in Expo, which interacts with an API. The API schedules jobs using BullMQ (Which uses Redis), and there’s a lightweight worker that fulfills those jobs (The worker just sends some HTTP requests and interacts with a Postgres database).\n So I have to host - Redis - Postgres (Hosted by Supabase at the moment) - An API (Node) - Worker (Node)\n I was thinking the worker would be a good fit for a serverless function, though I’ve never worked with them.

Or are they saying they should create a copy of their repository in GitLab/GitHub and pay the costs of two providers just to use the pipeline? Currently I'm in a team using Jira and Confluence so I think it makes sense for us to go with BitBucket since code review can easily be done in a way that ties to user stories and it is discounted with our other Atlassian products. Why don't more people that use Jira use BitBucket? And what is the best option for a company using Jira? Do we copy our BitBucket repo to GitLab, do we use GitLab and use a Jira integration but still not have our code review be able to be tied to user stories, or do we use a CI/CD manager like Jenkins which most people agree is complex to manage?

          "description": "Hi Yall, \n I'm curious on your opinions on the right relationship between fullstack developers and sre when it comes to ownership of load balancing and security services (authorization, EDR, etc.)?\n In this case our fullstack team owns development of a customer facing product which includes our SAAS API and various front ends. The API is composed of micro-services. It does biz logic things like user management, fetching results, ingesting media inputs and passing them into our core engine which is owned by MLEs... \n We are a small startup, I am the first and only devops engineer at the moment. I initially wrote authorization and owned load balancing into the system but out of feeling that I was spread too thin I passed this ownership off to the fullstack team. My sense over the past few months is that the fullstack team shouldn't ideally own load balancing and authorization, they tend to do things really quickly and dirtily and I suppose I'm not fully comfortable with their approach. My sense is that this should be owned by security minded SREs who are already responsible for production.\n Can you guys assist in providing insight into my potential blindspots? What are your thoughts?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/MachineDisastrous771  \n [link]   [comments]",

An awesome paradigm at the base layer and so much interesting built on top of it.\n Observability - almost a science in itself and plenty to get into (or related to) be it monitoring, alerting, analytics, service management. \n Platform management - building out a consumable platform, kinda like being a developer for developers.\n Architect - the problem I have with this is developers are going to have their own software architects doing system design that the may overlap already with the infra side. Also many expect engineers to have software architects skills anyway. So where does that leave the cloud/DevOps architect? I feel there is not much mileage in this path.\n Any others? As each year passes the more I think it is not a good idea to stay in the middle as a generalist and time to pick a path.\n    submitted by    /u/gowithflow192  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think a good PM should worth the salary of one dev + one business side, and probably more if applicable.\n Sometimes I wonder why it is so difficult to grow one good PM. I suspect it has something to do with how corporations grow. In the beginning there is usually no middle man, and devs directly talk to the business. This is fine when it is still small -- but then business grows and experienced devs/business either leave or just care about their own stuffs. Then corp realizes that it needs some middle men -- but they rarely hire devs/businesses from the rank, instead hiring from externals -- those people might be good PM in their previous companies, but they are sort of useless in the new environment because each one has its own communication \"flavors\". Then it needs another 2-3 years to grow those PMs, but how can they learn effectively if they neither go through business nor dev? It's going to take much longer to learn the rope -- and that's why we see so many echo chambers instead -- it's not their fault, because they are not experienced in this specific environment, what else can they do?\n That leaves my conclusion that a company should always hire PM from experienced internal business or devs instead, and PM should be a senior position -- there should be no \"junior\" PM positions.

If another publish attempt occurs, I will read !published again and try to publish when I shouldn't.\n I could update the published column before the publish has occurred, but 1) this is an anti pattern since the publish hasn't occurred yet and 2) if the db update succeeds but the publish fails, I'll again have a column that is inaccurate.\n I suppose in this particular circumstance I could just roll back the db update - but that could also fail.\n If this happens 25,000 times in one day, I need to know which ones are inaccurate etc.\n Are there more sophisticated/elegant ways for handling this sort of problem?\n Edit:\n Thanks everyone for all the feedback. I guess I should add: there is UI involvement here where we want to allow the user to take the action that causes the publish only once. We want to disallow taking that action on the UI more than once. We also want to enforce the constraint in the backend. IMO it is bad design to let the user believe they can take action when they can't. We could let them sit there and click buttons all day and just let the backend decide and return an error code when they shouldn't have initiated the action, or we could stop them from taking the action in the first place which is what we're doing.\n    submitted by    /u/lsrwlf  \n [link]   [comments]",

The project would take forever to complete.\n This past weekend, I was recovering from a surgery, so I decided to \"hack\" this new project. I terraformed the infrastructure, and creating a workable prototype (limited functionality). I built this entire system in two days. It would have taken my team weeks/months, if they had started working on it from 0%.\n Now, I can delegate the 20% of the work (refactoring, optimzation, etc) to my team and just relax this upcoming quarter. Does anyone else do this type of \"runway\", getting ahead of the team sprints?\n    submitted by    /u/Gordon101  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n Work for an agency so I generally do client work. I've been with my current client for an unusually long time (years) which is my longest term engagement and they're very happy with me. It's a non-tech company in a lucrative industry.\n The work is generally easy but I am the only developer in the organization. As such, the work I do is often glueing their SaaS products together in some way or building small internal tools for my stakeholders. Don't really exercise my dev muscles often and the easiest (least complicated) solution is often the best one for their needs.\n The pay is great and generally the WLB is comfortable, but I don't work with any other devs and really feel my skills deprecating over time. The pay is at the top-end of what my expected range would be like so it's difficult to make a change without taking a pay cut. I worry that whenever this engagement ends (they always do), I will be a much worse dev than I was prior to working here. However, it's hard to not make hay while the sun is shining, so to speak, and just collect the easy money while it's here.\n What would you do?\n    submitted by    /u/htom3heb  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So we have a fairly new CTO thats pushing for various different process changes in dev teams. \n Two of these is trunk based development and full time pair programming to enable CI/CD. \n For context my team looks after a critical area of our platforms (the type where if we screw up serious money can be lost and we'll have regulators to answer to). We commit to repos that are contributed to by multiple teams and basically use a simplified version of Gitflow with feature branches merging into master only when fully reviewed & tested and considered prod ready. Once merged to master the change is released to prod. \n From time to time we do pair programming but tend to only do it when it's crunch time where necessary. The new process basically wants this full time. Devs have trialed this and feel burned out doing the pair programming all day everyday. \n Basically I ran my team on the idea of trunk based development and they're heavily against it including the senior devs (one of whom called it 'madness'). \n The main issue from their perspective is they consider it risky and few others don't think it will actually improve anything. I'm not entirely clued up on where manual QA testing fits into the process either but what I've read suggests this takes place after merge to master & even release which is a big concern for the team. Devs know that manual QA's capture important bugs via non-happy paths despite having a lot of automated tests and 100% code coverage. We already use feature flags for our projects so that we only expose this to clients when ready but devs know this isn't full proof.\n We've spoken about perhaps trialing this with older non-critical apps (which didn't get much buy in) and changes are rarely needed on these apps so I don't see us actually being able to do this any time soon whereas the CTO (and leadership below) is very keen for all teams to take this all on by this summer.\n    submitted by    /u/rjm101  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi.\n I'm looking at the following scenario: A (enterprise) team went the microservices route. Unfortunately there is zero data locality, everything is layered horizontally (persistence service, entity A logic service, entity B logic service, etc) and everything depends on everything else. Services keep each in other sync via synchronous RPC over network. In short, it's a distributed monolith.\n The project has progressed too far to make major architecture changes, and we need to move fast.\n We will soon have the foreseeable issue that keeping state synchronized across multiple distributed services and databases is hard. I shudder to think how the current system would behave during outages, and the many inconsistent states it will get in. I fear that if we don't intervene now, it will turn into a maintenance nightmare on release.\n If you've been in a similar situation, which eventual consistency pattern did you go with, and what was your experience? My main concern is keeping implementation overhead as low as possible. I've thought about the usual at-least-once event-driven + idempotency route, but I'm worried about the overhead during day-to-day development, and amount of changes required to even get started with that. Maybe try 2 phase commits instead?\n If you've been in a similar situation of trying to work with a distributed monolith, I'd be curious to hear what you went with, and what your experience was.\n    submitted by    /u/LizCDR  \n [link]   [comments]",

I pride myself on being able to teach myself and adapt so it doesn't feel great to admit I'm not capable.\n UPDATE: There is some really great advice in this thread and it's good to know I am not the only one this has happened to.

I didn't have anyone depending on me and I could get by with low income.\n However, when I came back to Spain, sitting at ~3 YoE and with a brand new bachelor's under my belt, I felt I could go for more since some friends of mine with whom I studied at the start of my career were earning a lot with the same experience as me.

          "description": "Had my 1 on 1 with my manager today. We have had an open for another senior engineer on my team, so I was asking about the status of it. For almost a year I've been a part of a leadership program to help get me promoted to lead. I've gotten a lot of positive feedback along the way and told that I'm making great progress. According to my manager, because of some of the work that we have coming up in the near future 1. that senior role that I mentioned got bumped to lead (we already have a lead) and 2. they made a pitch for me but ultimate was denied by my skip because there's a \"local\" candidate in the pipeline.\n All things considered I'm taking it in stride. I wasn't expecting to be promoted this soon anyway and this unfortunately lines up with the company direction of moving to more in-office / hybrid. There are a bunch of people that were hired (and still are) remote - seniors / leads / principals / managers / directors - one of whom is my manager. Most people still don't go into the office except on rare occasions like vertical get togethers where remote folks fly in too.\n I really enjoy working for the company that I do, so the game plan for now is just to keep kicking butt and make myself undeniable for promo. Looking elsewhere for a lead / staff job has crossed my mind, but I have an agreement with myself that I'll wait until 5 years before doing that (currently sitting at 3 and some change at my current level). Moving back to where the company is based out of has also crossed my mind - I used to live there, but moved back to my home state to be closer to family during the pandemic.\n I'm curious - have y'all run into similar situations? How have you handled it? Also, I have a 1 on 1 with my skip level in a month who denied my promo. Any tips? They're new to me because of a re-org, so it'll be the first time we've met.

Management and HR is not happy with the progress, too many candidates fail the technical interviews, its taking too long to sign new employees. It is decided that there will be no technical interviews from now on, HR will handle 100% of the recruitment process. Focus on \"soft values and skills\".\n 2022, it is still a disaster. We have signed a lot of new emoloyees, most with wrong skillsets due to HR having no clue about what we need. We needed senior software developers and we got database admins, sysadmins, service desk agents etc that wanted to get into software development. \n 2024, we are still in a very bad state, and guess what?

They pushes back on every feedback they gets in the PRs with very very long responses, links to resources, etc. \n We decided to let them work on a new initiative, so they could take their time to understand our process since there wasn’t a hard deadline on it. The project has become a deviant and a one-off where they didn’t follow any of the patterns we used on any of the other services. Basically you tell them, we need to do C and to get there we need to build A and B. He then goes and builds E, F, G, H and then finally C. You tell him that that’s not how we usually do things, and then they asks you to write the requirements for it, and they will make sure that C matches those requirements… I don’t think anyone else on the team would be able to contribute to this project or support it, which is almost like a legacy service being brand new.\n They don’t get involved in any of the other tasks the rest of the team does, but constantly requires time from everyone to review their PRs. They also started getting very involved with other teams organizing lunch and learns, presentations, discussions and trying to get buy-in from other teams in how they do things.\n This individual is a very smart person and I don’t doubt his technical skills.. but is really a pain to work with him.

Little did I know, they were about to announce a funding round, invalidating the previous strike price and the strike price that I would receive has tripled (which I have not yet been granted). Sure I still get X # options however they are now at 3x the strike price. This means that instead of paying say $200k to exercise my options I have to pay $600k if I ever want to exercise (with the risk that it becomes potentially be worthless if it never IPOs).\n Given that I don't see the company realistically going IPO until at least 5+ years, this means if I leave before then I will have to either shell out a large amount of money or just leave my stake on the table. If I just leave it on the table then it only makes financial sense for me to stay at the company the amount of time equal to the amount of options I am willing to exercise.\n Has anyone else joined in the middle of a raise unknowingly and are there other solutions?

I'm going through some existential crisis and just felt like writing it out.\n I've been a developer for around 14-15 years and have worked on a lot of different tech and systems and have a good breadth of knowledge i'd say. \n But i've never really worked on anything with huge amounts of data or low latency requirements or extremely high throughout etc. Have always worked in big orgs and on systems with moderate non-functional specs and lots of business features. Historically i've not been into developer communities or open source contributions (earlier in career due to lack of awareness and now due all sorts of stuff including lack of motivation to do this outside work hours). I'm trying to change this a bit recently by getting more involved in communities in my company.\n Having said that within my teams i've always got good remarks, hikes and considered as a solid all-round senior. Pay was always good and I mostly enjoyed my work (was almost too grateful to even be hired as a SWE at the start). I also keep myself quite updated even though most of that knowledge stays mostly theoretical.\n As I evaluate my career i wonder if I should have seeked out more challenging work? There seems to be an expectation that after all these years one would have atleast tackled some hard technical challenge and I cant seem to think of any. Slowly starting to feel if i'm actually good to even handle anything challenging now and that's not helping my confidence to even look for such opportunities. What if I get an opportunity and fail?\n Just wondering if others have gone through such a phase and found their peace somehow? Or any advice on how to position myself for the next 15 years of my career? \n    submitted by    /u/rchan88  \n [link]   [comments]",

I genuinely do not slack off at all, but the fact that I keep receiving this feedback (and that it has followed me between companies) indicates to me that I’m clearly at least doing a poor job of representing myself.\n For example: once, after a particularly rough sprint a manager had a version of this conversation with me, and we pulled up metrics, and over the course of that sprint I’d completed more tickets than anyone else on the team, and had completed the same number of “urgent” tickets as the rest of the team combined. (And it’s not as though I just pick easy tickets to pump my numbers)\n In one-off situations like that it’s easy to be like, look, I’m sorry I’m giving off this appearance, but if we look at the actual work that got done I think it’s clear I’m pulling my weight… but it’s really not a conversation I enjoy having over and over.

I explained to him that we didn't have requirements for that and because of differences in the implementation, they wouldn't really work for this customer.\n On Friday he emailed the customer and asked them if they were planning on flowing us new requirements for the features that we discussed because it would make the tool much better. He didn't copy me, but the customer emailed back, copying me, and said they were considering it. I replied that we could discuss it, but gave the reasons why it wouldn't be a good idea for them.\n They also copied our management and our director came and yelled at me for \"requirements fishing\" - someone at the customer felt we were trying to increase the scope to inflate the contract value. To be honest, my reply wasn't the best (I didn't think it through enough and I can see why they might have thought we were coordinating)\n I'm pissed, if I were management, I'd fire him.

My company has an office out here, but announced recently they're closing it at the end of the month, after which I'll be fully remote.\n I don't particularly care for the city I live in, and thought that remote work would be a great opportunity to move to a larger city with more energy, namely NYC. I've been floating this idea around my team since the announcement of the closure was made, and haven't gotten any negative feedback around it, so I felt pretty confident about the topic when I officially asked my boss if I could move to NYC after I become fully remote.\n He got back to me a few days later (after speaking with HR), and said that a move is totally doable, if I take a $50k pay cut in my TC. I was pretty floored at this request, especially since by any metric NYC is more expensive than where I currently live, but the rationale is that the pay bands in NYC are ostensibly lower for my job compared to my current city.\n I'm wondering, is this level of pay cut common for a move from the west coast to NYC? It seems totally unreasonable to me, especially after looking at jobs at some of the other tech companies operating out of NYC. Many of these companies actually explicitly state that their pay bands are identical for NYC and the city I live in currently.

Developers are going to want to build their sandcastles. And the idea I think it was trying to express was the desire of software developerss to build the most complete, robust, and elegant solutions they could engineer for the problems they are trying to solve.\n Sometimes this may be good, but the context I think I remember the metaphor in was that of, \"project managers are necessary otherwise develops will never make progress towards a end goal, with endless scope creep and analysis paralysis\". Thinking about it now, I think this metaphor was being used in reference to the video game industry when I heard it.\n This post is two part, firstly, and mostly for my curiosity, I was hoping you all who are familiar with this expression could remind me exactly how it goes and provide your take on it.\n Secondly, I would like to start a discussion on the topic. At work, I don't really seem to face this issue that often. But when working on a personal project, I seem to almost never get very far because I get stuck in this trance where I am trying to over engineer the first problems I come across with any amount of complexity. For example, I have tried writing a vulkan renderer multiple times now, and each time I get stuck on trying to build a thesis on device and queue selection, coding for every use case that I can imagine, when in reality I only need one or two simple methods for accomplishing this task.

          "description": "Apart from using an actual debugger - in some cases you can’t have a debugger attached to the process, or the behavior you’re facing is complex and emergent, and you cannot just put a breakpoint or log statement there. If attaching a debugger is possible, then of course I just attach a debugger.\n Let me share mines:\n  \nIsolate - if something’s tricky, try to have the simplest isolated reproduction that you can have. This cuts out unnecessary complexity and usually also speeds up iterations.\n Isolate early - it’s tempting to think that “I just need to fix this here, redeploy and it’ll probably work”, but I found that more often than not, I should have isolated the case earlier. It’s balancing between the likelihood of fixing it in place in a couple of iterations with a longer cycle and between investing time upfront in the isolation to have shorter feedback cycle. Also, the skill of efficiently isolating cases is something that improves with practice.\n “Approach from two ends” - I’m not sure if this has a name, sometimes it can be called ‘binary search’. When I tried everything that I could think of but it all doesn’t seem to make any sense, then I step back and try to ‘brute force’ it. This usually starts by taking my problematic case on one end, and a known working example of what I’m trying to achieve on the other end. Then I start modifying on both ends: stripping down parts on the first end, and adding more and more parts on the other end, so that they become more and more similar. At some point, the difference that I didn’t think of pops out. A similar approach also works for example if a new release of an app has a regression, but it’s not clear from the code change why - then we can start producing synthetic approximation releases in a test environment to see where exactly things break. I really like this approach, it really helped me solve cases where I had no idea why things don’t work.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/my_dev_acc  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n Recently I joined company with very bad codebase. Plain react with javascript, no standards, no linting or type checking, first changes dating back to 2015. Codebase is editied by everything based on their needs, so you can image quality of the code.\n Converting to typescript is impossible due to scope and lack of human resources. Everyone in the team likes current setup and really not cares about improving. Mgnment wants me to improve everything (they don’t know what, they just want to be sure that project is up to these days standarts) and fix bugs that noone can fix. So naturally other devs are maximum junior-mid level.\n I feel like I am loosing my skills and this is my biggest worry. I am super afraid to become bad at coding after working in these kind of projects. I am literally abandoning typescript and good coding standarts. No one wants to do big improvements or changes, only me. Should I try to do something about it or better not waste my time and switch company? I have joined this company due to pay raise, but it feels like skills cut…\n    submitted by    /u/dabe3ee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm a fairly experienced dev with a broad knowledge so I tend to move around teams as needed. It's kind of my thing and companies like it because I always work on top priorities.\n However this has exposed me to the fact that every single local build never ever works initially. Normally there are some docs slightly out of date, you follow them and error. Some unhappy container, undefined variables, some stuff that doesn't install, unit tests won't run.\n The only way to make it run is to fight through it during long several days of debugging, normally heavily assisted by someone in the team that has the right lore (normally this person is busy for the same reason so can only help here and there) \n It kills me that in my 10 plus years I haven't seen much progress in this part of the dev cycle. Docker was supposed to fix it but then we made stuff around docker complex. We have fancy complicated and fragil infra. Don't get me started with stuff like bazel. When Mr bazel had enough and leaves the company, it becomes the \"we don't know what that does so don't touch it\" and it's exactly where it will break when I'm trying to get up to speed. \n Sorry a bit ranty. \n Have I been unlucky in my career or have you seen this issue too?

I watch Captain Planet as a kid, I was a boy-scout and topic of nature preservation is important to me but I wouldn't call myself an activist and my priority is to make this game fun. I setup Steam page and I gather Wishlists. I don't have marketing budget so I post about my game on various social medias. Most of the times feedback is positive but there are some people who really don't like the idea. But not only that. They call me \"leftist r*tard\" \"NWO shill\" and \"pinkhair soyboy\".

          "description": "So, I did all the basics of math in school and I took an upgraded course before I could study comp. science at university.\n I was bad at it, and Math doesn't actually interest me. The sciences never did, so it's weird I've landed myself in Computer science, and truth be told, I'm not a particularly skilled programmer either. My field of interest lie in the aesthetics, the creative, and the collaboration of thinking of, and implementing games. I did just well enough in projects that I didn't feel discouraged from the entire field, and now I still want to be a contributor in game dev. That said, I feel like math or just my inattention to detail is a problem.\n During the higher education I encountered a few instances where I would tell someone \"Err, so I don't actually know how to write this\" and they'd say \"It's just phytagoras. I can't tell you what to do.\" and I had to figure something out on my own to make a cube move on the screen or something, and I ended up kinda not figuring it out, and I think eventually whoever said something about pythagoras did something on his own.\n And it's not like I don't know the pythagoras sentence, it's just that in practice I suck at math and barely know how to apply it. I remember some shit we drew on a blackboard but it doesn't come naturally to me to think mathematically.\n But now I'm facing specific needs like, I wanna figure out how to make an eye shader, cuz I have a 3D model where I'm dissatisfied with how glassy the eyes look. But people give me math stuff to figure it out. I'll be running in circles with some design I'm trying to code until some smart guy shows me some x = y2 + i > 0 ???? math that apparently solves it in one sentence.\n So I'm a bit agitated by my lack of appliccable knowledge. Do you find that Math is important to your average game work? And if I were to learn about how to develop my own shaders, is there some kind of book that could help me?\n    submitted by    /u/linkenski  \n [link]   [comments]",

Naming it something ambiguous like Nox Arcanum or Ultima sorta has the benefit that they don't really \"say\" anything about the game, and do not constrain the developer in terms of story or design.\n And of course I don't want to get sued if something is \"too close\" to something else.

The steam shop page exists for a few months, not resulting in many wishlists, which I would expect for a hobby project without marketing (except for a few YouTube shorts (~100-400 views each)).\n So the daily wishlists were around 0-1, mostly 0. Then, a few days ago, I checked the tags again, and compared them to the tags to \"The Escapists\", since the gameplay is pretty similar.\n Here is my little/big fuck-up: The tag I initially set with the highest priority is (in german) \"Ausbruchssimulation\", which can also be understood as a game where you/the player has to break out of somewhere. I was kinda wondering why \"The Escapists\" is not tagged with the same tag, as I would imagine it is the most fitting for this kind of game.\n I looked at the games that were tagged with \"Ausbruchssimulation\", saw stuff like Pague Inc. etc., and had an epiphany: changed the language to english, \"Ausbruchssimulation\" is the translation for \"Outbreak Sim\".\n Yeah, so i removed the tag and (at least for the four days since) this also had an impact on daily wishlists: https://ibb.co/GHgBXxh\n    submitted by    /u/projectbreakout  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Since I started making games, people around me are creating \"Game Ideas\" and asking me to implement them. Without any context. Without understanding market, game design and mechanics, scope and cost. It's especially irritating because mostly family and friends have that \"great ideas\" and I can't tell them to go away (usually).\n To anyone doing this and not understanding why gamedev usually don't pick up your ideas.\n Everyone have \"ideas\". I can literally from the top of my head in 1h give you 20 games ideas. 1 idea every 3 minutes. But ideas without full context, are not worth much. It's because every idea need days or weeks of actual work to create a design and validate if it's a good to make a game from it. With mechanics working together, with story, with scenario, with checking if similar games exist, with validating if mechanics are really working, if they are fun. And most of the time because of details in game design it will turn out \"the idea\" is not working. If you come to a gamedev with an \"idea\", understand that what really gamedev sees is not a solution, but a problem. You are basically asking someone to spend dozens of hours, maybe days or weeks to validate if \"the idea\" makes sense.\n If you want to cooperate with someone making games, make a full game design instead**.** Do the leg work. Prepare full concept. Check market. Play many games in genre of game from your \"idea\". Validate the concept as much as you can. Find assets. Learn what GDD is. If game is story driven - learn how to write. Write short stories first and check with audience your writing. Then write a story for your \"idea\". I mean - depending on the game type, spend at least 100-300h of work before you start talking to someone making games. Then be prepared to put another hundreds of hours of working closely with a gamedev.\n Ideas are cheap. 1 \"idea\" is created in 3 minutes.\n Full concepts are worth much more. But still the biggest cost is in making a game.\n    submitted by    /u/DevPot  \n [link]   [comments]",

The game also supports multiplayer.\n Teaser:\n In the teaser footage, I’m showcasing some of the environments, gathering mechanics, alien life, points of interest, combat, player base interactions, character movement, overall feel, and theme of the game.\n Feedback:\n I’d like to hear your thoughts on all these aspects, including the graphics.\n Development Teaser [on the Steam page]:\n https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800450/Planetaries/\n Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Jaarekt22  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm actually not joking, If I had a time machine to 15 years ago, sigh\n Though if the hubris does overwhelm, pick an easier game genre, Something one person can do, no matter how brilliant you think you are, you really are not. Still it could of been worse I could of chosen a MMORPGGGGGH\n Don't make a major gameplay change midway (I done 2 on this game adventure, turn based -> realtime & dungeons -> Open World). Lesson learnt, If the game ain't happening, scrap it and start something new, don't try to shoehorn what you have into this cause it will bite you in the ass later \n Don't roll your own code. i.e re-invent the wheel, Sure this is oldhat advice. But take it from an oldfart, dont. I went from my own engine in c++/opengl & my own physics engine -> my engine + ODE -> Unity & C#. I wasn't cool rolling my own, I was just a dick wasting hours, hours that could of been useful realizing my dream \n  \nPositive advice:\n  \nOnly 2 rules in programming\n #1 KISS - Always keep it simple, you may think you're smart doing some shortcut or elegant solution, but 50% of the time you're creating problems down the track, why roll the dice, play it smart. OK this is a mantra but #2 is not well known\n #2 Treat everything as equal. AKA - don't make exceptions, no matter how much sense they appear to make, inevitably it will bite you in the ass later\n Now I still violate both the rules even now (after 40 years of programming) So this is do as I say, not as I do thing\n Don't be afraid to go out of your comfort zone. Myself, In the last couple of years, I've (with my GF) had my child, something I swear I would never do (It happened though) & gone to help in Ukraine.

The best outcome is that your playtester comes to that conclusion themselves.\n Playtester: \"The movement feels very stiff, but those restrictions make the moment-to-moment gameplay more intense.

I must say, it's sadly not very populated.\n I'm not sure why as the UI and site layout is perfect for it's role, I'd really love to see it used more.\n Are people aware of this site? If so are you willing to donate shader code to it?\n I've seen 20-30 posts sharing shader code over the past 2 days and I feel it rather sad that that code will practically vanish once the posts are thrown to the bottom of the reddit post stack. A lot of them just don't get enough attention to show up in search result so for all intents and purposes they're gone.\n I'd like to urge players to post their shaders on the site - it really is a great archive and I feel it would add a lot more permanency to your contribution. As it stands, posting it to reddit you're limiting yourself (and others) to around a 48 hour window before the post becomes practically invisible to the general public.\n    submitted by    /u/Enough-Town3289  \n [link]   [comments]",

It’s straightforward, open-source, and I hope it can be useful to some of you!\n Features:\n  \nDynamic Building: Add robust building functions that allow players to construct and customize their environments.\n Customizable: Adjust it to suit your game’s unique style and needs.\n Written in C#: Currently available in C#, ensuring robust performance and integration.\n Open Source: Free to use and modify under the MIT License—contributions are welcome!\n  \nWhy consider it?\n It’s built specifically for Godot, making integration smooth, and it’s a great way to add interactive elements to your game. I’d love for you to try it out and share any feedback or suggestions!\n Future Plans:\n I am planning to develop a version in GDScript based on community interest. The sooner I see significant interest, the faster I'll work on releasing the GDScript version!\n 👉 See it on Asset Store\n Thanks for checking it out, and happy developing!\n https://preview.redd.it/zeuwv7ap0xzc1.png?width=1909&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7965ac479b01febc11ec936a41a26f9834f1b42\n https://preview.redd.it/0ejea6ap0xzc1.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf4bd2c92bcfbbbd5a25dcf673401113043b2e47\n https://preview.redd.it/zsz2b7ap0xzc1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=57c6a919e2442096810898033963b6f90b2c434f\n https://preview.redd.it/9kz3s6ap0xzc1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bb891adf24bbdab584384b6a7100f283cbc0f7b\n https://preview.redd.it/i0ye79ap0xzc1.png?width=1910&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9fd5bafb4e69be8bd3953b53a355f2aaa25a30f\n    submitted by    /u/MaliciusD  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instead of using LLVM to generate machine code, I generate rust, because if I can use rust I will (even for shaders). \n And with help of gdext, I won't have to deal with GDExtensions.\n Benchmarks\n The rust version (without optimizations) can run 5 times faster in this case nth Fibonacci number.\n  GDScript: 390 ms Rust: 77 ms \n (Code for the benchmark can be seen in addon/bench.gd)\n Features\n  \nFunction\n Calling functions in the same file\n Math\n for loops\n while loops\n if\n variables\n Addon\n maybe I missed something else\n  \nLimitations\n  \nUsing other Nodes.\n calling function outside the file\n Can generate wrong rust code\n And a lot more\n  \nFAQ\n Why rust?\n I like it.\n Will this make normal GDScript obsolete?\n No, GDScript is really nice to debug. And fast to iterate.\n Why is GDScript slow?\n IMO, I think the main problem is loops, it's something that any interpreted language fears.\n Why not make a JIT?\n While it will be better for dynamically typed language like GDScript, but it will be harder to implement. Oh, and JIT's won't work on IOS.\n Why not use rust or c++ direly\n Debug in Godot, run with rust. GDScript is easy to debug for normal people, for compiled languages you need to use lldb or gdb.\n Future\n  \nbeg Godot devs for --script-dump-ast\n Better codegen (this that takes AST and makes rust source code)\n Improve the add-on.\n  \nI won't be working on this for some time. Writing a parser is only fun the first time, not 2 times + other failed attempts with parser generators. Basically, nothing will be done until --script-dump-ast, and then maybe I will continue.\n Maybe this will revive this issue.\n    submitted by    /u/ssd-guy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Godot 4.2 will still default to 6.0, but you can edit your .csproj file to change this.\n \nBelieve it or not, you can use full native AOT compilation with C# in Godot projects. That's right: no more virtual machine IL interpreting JIT nonsense. Real machine code.

They knew full well that they didn't meet the system requirements, but wanted to try it anyway. Turned out the game ran pretty awfully on Proton because of their hardware, the framerate skipped wildly around, their progress kept getting wiped out, and certain textures either didn't load or popped in after several minutes.\n I had put off building for Linux until I could boot it up myself on an old PC, so I spent the day trying to debug the issue with them and figure out if there were certain settings that could improve their experience.\n In the end, we couldn't find any fixes. So I took a leap of faith, put all my chips on Godot and just blindly built a Linux version for them without testing it, figuring it probably wouldn't work but was worth a shot.\n It worked PERFECTLY, first try, no issues.\n Love this engine, love you guys. Shown above is me and the new player absolutely dumbfounded by Godot effortlessly taking care of business.\n    submitted by    /u/AuraTummyache  \n [link]   [comments]",

It was also when I realized go has any data type. \n But why this way? Why did they have to call any as \"interface\"? Why didn't they just call it any straight away? \n I'm also aware at the fact that now go has introduced \"any\" as any along with generics feature.

You can't learn it that way anyway, and learning it is my main objective) and let me say that is also an amazing tool. Anytime I am unsure about something I just ask the AI and it clears it up. What a great time to learn a new language. I've been having some trouble grasping interfaces, but it's not like I must understand them right now. I'm not a newbie. C was my first language, then Python, C#, a bit of Java, bash, batch, and I used Visual Basic a long time ago, but I usually don't mention that. I welcome any tips you guys may have that could help me understand it even better. I primarily intend to use it for CLI, and web applications.

I've seen in the documentation that you should always reuse the clients in order to take advantage of existing HTTP connections. At first, that looks pretty straight forward: initiate a new client at start time, attach it to the server struct and access the client from anywhere, like a singleton.\n Now, say I have a Gitlab client that sends requests on behalf of an user which has provided an access token. I cannot initiate the client at start time and reuse it (setting the token before calling the api) because I could have race conditions where an user ends up with the token from someone else, so sharing an authenticated client seems like a no go. \n I think I could create a client per http request, making it unique per client, but then if I only make one call to gitlab per request it's the same thing as never reusing the client.\n Do I make sense?

          "description": "Hello all. I've been working as an embedded software engineer for about 8 years and wanted to move my career in the direction of backend and cloud. I was just rejected from a role after completing a take home assignment writing a simple RESTful API for a microservice managing one resource. The position was a Golang position (which I admittedly have no experience in) but the assignment did not have to be written in Go. I decided to write it in Go anyways because:\n  \nI would need to learn the language if I were to be hired for the position anyways.\n \nIt would be nice to learn a new language and it's ecosystem even if I were to be rejected.\n \n So I poured my heart into learning Go and some select frameworks. I honestly thought I did well enough on the assignment considering it's my first real attempt to write something in Go that isn't absolutely trivial. I was not given any feedback for where I went wrong so I'm left in the dark here. Can any of you give me some feedback on my code? Really appreciate the time.\n https://github.com/brandonto/rest-api-microservice-demo\n EDIT:\n I'd like to thank you all for the enormous feedback. It's heavily appreciated. Never thought that I would have received so much in such a short time frame. I think I have a clear understanding of where the weak points lie now for future projects. I'll definitely be incorporating some of the suggestions in future projects. Perhaps even make changes to this one for the sake of completeness.\n As for the job, while I am a bit disappointed after sinking in hours into this project, I'm just treating it as part of the learning experience.\n I probably won't have the time to respond to any new comments. But I'd like to thank everybody again.\n Golang is a lovely language. :)\n    submitted by    /u/brandonto  \n [link]   [comments]",

It can also print out the function that wraps over it and the function that wraps over the function that wraps over it... spreading out the whole calling hierarchy onto the terminal. In this way, when debugging, I can quickly locate which line is doing the complaining by clicking the link on my terminal.\n The code is here: https://github.com/Yifeeeeei/butterknife\n A quick example here, the comments show the output:\n package main ​ import ( \"github.com/Yifeeeeei/butterknife\" ) ​ func main() { a := \"a\" b := \"b\" butterknife.Print(a, b) // [main.go:10 main.main] ab ​ butterknife.Println(a, b) // [main.go:13 main.main] a b ​ butterknife.Printf(\"a:%s ,b:%s\\n\", a, b) // [main.go:16 main.main] a:a ,b:b ​ caller() } ​ func caller() { c := \"c\" d := \"d\" butterknife.PrintHierarchy(c, d) // [main.go:19 main.main] // [main.go:25 main.caller] // cd ​ butterknife.PrintlnHierarchy(c, d) // [main.go:19 main.main] // [main.go:30 main.caller] // c d ​ butterknife.PrintfHierarchy(\"c:%s ,d:%s\\n\", c, d) // [main.go:19 main.main] // [main.go:35 main.caller] // c:c ,d:d } ​ \n Right now it only supports 12 different styles (print with fmt/log, print/printf/println, with/without hierarchy), but I may add more functionalities to it later.\n    submitted by    /u/Parking_Bite_6416  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the Python world, I was used to riding on the shoulders of giants. Python frameworks usually provide built-in tools for authentication—everything from password validation and encryption to token expiration and third-party logins.\n Now, as I start developing my first API with Go Chi1, I've noticed the prevalent advice is to implement features from scratch. This shift has left me anxious about potential missteps and the risk of creating an insecure application.\n Do you all build auth from scratch when using Go Chi, or are there trusted libraries you rely on? How do you manage the complexity and ensure security? \n 1 Choosing Chi over the many other \"expressive, lightweight, API router\" was already a tough dilemma (and still I don't know if I chose the right tool).

          "description": "My girlfriend (a non-programmer) recently asked me what it means when programmers say that \"everything is just binary under the hood\". I started telling her how files don't intrinsically \"mean\" something and that programs simply do something with the bytes.\n For instance, an image utility assumes that if there is a file.png somewhere and its internal binary layout follows the PNG conventions then it must be an image and it will display that image on screen interpreting the bytes as RGBA values. However, other programs may interpret these same bytes differently and do other things with them.\n To demo that concept in the most obvious way, I created snapsound - a CLI (for now) that allows you to transform any MP3 file into a PNG image but retain the ability to play back the original sound. It's as simple as\n snapsound snap song.mp3 # Creates song.png snapsound play song.png \n If you're curious, the code is completely open source on GitHub. It can be easily installed with go intall.\n As a summation of this little research effort, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it is to write a program that plays sound in Go! The only thing is, I think that github.com/gopxl/beep (one of the deps) requires CGo to build on Linux, but MacOS and Windows are pure Go, no need for anything else (already tested both).\n    submitted by    /u/sharpvik  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would have to create a specific struct with all my functionality and a mock for it.\n What I am used to, and thought was a good design, was to have all fs methods to take a fs instance and given that go does do that for few things I was confused when I don't see that as just \"the way to do it\".\n Also, os.DirFS is admittedly broken for things that require dynamic paths or cross os compat, which makes it hard to use things like MapFS in your tests (MapFS looks so good on paper).\n Is there something I need to learn about this to get more comfortable or did I get to the same conclusion as everyone else?\n    submitted by    /u/5DBookshelf  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I've written pktstat-bpf, a simple replacement for ncurses/libpcap-based pktstat, using Linux eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) program, allowing packet statistics gathering even under very high traffic volume conditions, typically several million packets per second even on an average server. In this scenario (high volume, DoS attacks etc.) typically regular packet capture solutions start being unreliable due to increasing packet loss.\n By default it uses TC (Traffic Control) eBPF hooks with TCX attaching requiring at minimum Linux kernel v6.6 for both ingress and egress traffic statistics. Alternatively it can switch to XDP (eXpress Data Path) hook but with a consequence of losing egress statistics since XDP works only in ingress path. XDP mode due to XDP program to network interface attaching calls requires at minimum Linux kernel v5.9. Some distributions might have backported XDP/TC patches (notable example is Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel) and eBPF program might work on older kernels too.\n When using XDP on SmartNICs (100GE and more) it is possible to run in XDP Offloaded mode where XDP program loads directly on NIC with hardware XDP support and executes without using CPU, allowing wire speed statistics even on 100+Gbps speeds.\n At the end of the execution program will display per-IP and per-protocol statistics sorted by per-connection bps, packets and (source-IP:port, destination-IP:port) tuples, either in plaintext or as JSON.\n Program consists of the eBPF code in C and the pure-Go userland Golang program that parses and outputs final IP/port/protocol/bitrate statistics. Go part of the program uses wonderful cillium/ebpf library to load and run eBPF program, interfacing with eBPF map.\n I would be glad to hear about any improvements, bugs or otherwise.

Now, every single command that I run on their machine gets logged, and there's a challenge where I have to initiate an SSH connection or run any UNIX commands without them being logged into that file.\n Is there any way to do this? Also, I was thinking if I write a Python or Bash script and then perform tasks on the provided machine, maybe only the execution of the script with its name will get logged.\n Does anyone have an idea or suggestions on HOWTO do this?\n    submitted by    /u/RoninPark  \n [link]   [comments]",

My next stop was Kali linux (which I love very deeply) and pretty soon I got obsessed with network penetration.

Can the same exploit be executed if the vulnerable c program runs on a different machine? Will memory addresses be the same?\n I think the answer is no they probably won´t even be the same when running only in the same environment and on the same machine. There is nothing like a guarantee that it will have the same address.\n A modern-day OS assigns the memory arbitrarily (within certain sections of course). This technique is called Address Space Layout Randomization. Also gcc or clang uses the --fstack-protector that prevents buffer overflow attacks\n Hence, my final question confuses me and make no sense for me based on this video is how geohot manage to exploit a buffer overflow attack remotely if addresses would not the same.

          "description": "I recently lost my job. I didn't particularly like it, so it's not sad in that sense; however, the financial implications are obviously less than ideal.\n I've been interested in cybersecurity for a long time and even took the CompTIA Security+ certification a few years ago just for fun, but that is the extent of my relevant experience. I want to use this as an opportunity to upskill myself and finally break into a field that I am genuinely passionate about, and I do not mind starting from the bottom. I have enough saved that I can go at this full time, 8-10 hours a day, for the next 4 months. Importantly, I have basically no other commitments.\n I have outlined a plan:\n  \n Month 1: TryHackMe + HTB boxes with walkthrough to get the basics down and document all progress. \n Month 2: Study for and take the PNPT (can't afford the OSCP), continue with HTB and THM. \n Month 3: Renew Security+ cert and start applying for tons of jobs, keep going at it with HTB and THM. \n Month 4: Keep applying, and hopefully get some interviews, and keep doing the same stuff and document all progress. And if I get no results maybe try my luck in Bug Bounty hunting.\n  \nI know this is a massive undertaking, and I realize it's going to be a tough few months. But I've always seemed to learn quickly, and I'm very committed to making this happen.\n I would greatly appreciate any feedback, critique, and advice that could help me in my journey.\n    submitted by    /u/DimWit666  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried Glow, but following links didn't work as I wanted. So I created MD-TUI. It has a file browser which finds all markdown files recursively. Optionally use gitignore to filter out some.\n I decided to write my own grammar for the markdown language, so it does not follow a specification 100%, but create an issue if you feel like it doesn't parse something correctly. Most of the common markdown syntax should be supported.\n If your terminal support some image protocol, it can also display images. Syntax highlighting is supported for some languages, and I am adding more as we speak.\n The biggest feature I have not seen other do, is a \"select link\" mode which allows you to scroll through the links in the file and follow them. Does not matter if it's a link to a heading, another file, or external URL to a website.\n Would be awesome to hear your thoughts.\n Edit: should have said it does not follow a specification 100%\n https://preview.redd.it/31aa4kmbdj0d1.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb1e4a9b912146a3a87ea0b6be84946ddacdcd80\n    submitted by    /u/The_Big_Hen  \n [link]   [comments]",

Those issues were found using valgrind - a memory debuting tool, which I now use to verify the Rust code compiled for .NET behaves correctly (the runtime can run under valgrind, if the right flags are set).\n I have also finished a round of extensive fuzzing (46 434 773 LOC of MIR test programs), which allowed me to find and patch many other issues (mostly related to floating-point numbers).\n Some issues still remain (13 out of 10 000 generated tests still fail, and the fuzzing tool I use does not check for every kind of bug), but a lot more Rust code should now compile properly.\n There is still a lot of work to do, but I wanted to share some of the progress.\n Also, the project has reached 1024(2^10) stars on GitHub!

The patterns are automatically provided to you, they're just there.\n What I want is this:\n [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 10] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 1] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 2] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 3] [src\\comb.rs:1260:3] count = [7, 0] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 4] // .. \n versus\n [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 10, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 1, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 2, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 3, ] [src\\comb.rs:1260:3] count = [ 7, 0, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 4, ] // .. \n This is actual dbg! output from my program, which also demonstrates how pretty printing can even be unnecessarily confusing. The lines [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count and [src\\comb.rs:1260:3] count are very similar, but in the single-line example it's much easier to spot the odd one out.\n I can copy-paste the source code into my own macro, but for a debug tool that I'd wanna use everywhere and anywhere it's just not the same. Is there an environment variable or some way to disable pretty printing everywhere? I've searched, but found none.\n Either way, curious to hear your thoughts on pretty printing for debug output.\n Your dearest friend,\n Yokin\n    submitted by    /u/Y0kin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Moreover, std Backtrace brings a lot of unrelated intermediate stacks and increases a significant runtime overhead.\n Our solution is built upon snafu, which is like a combination of thiserror and anyhow, with less than 1% runtime overhead and binary size.\n Check it out the blog for the design, implementation, and how it can benefit you: https://greptime.com/blogs/2024-05-07-error-rust\n    submitted by    /u/tison1096  \n [link]   [comments]",

The notion that Rust is a tough language puts people from even trying, including my past self. This is particularly relevant for those who, like me, have primarily worked with GC'd languages (I've only ever completed one semester course in C++ and never used it professionally).\n For me, the learning curve for Rust wasn't as steep as it was for other programming paradigms I've used extensively, such as logic or pure functional programming. It only took me an evening or two to get somewhat comfortable with Rust, and within a week I was able to finish the book and complete a couple of projects.

It's a macro that takes a regular expression and produces two things:\n  \nA type containing the compiled internal representation of the regular expression, or as close as we can get given the tools available to us. This means no runtime errors and faster regex object construction.\n A type containing all of the named capture groups in the expression, and a captures method that infallibly captures them. Unconditional capture groups are always present when a match is found, while optional or alternated groups appear as Option<Capture>. This is a significant ergonomic improvmenet over fallibly accessing groups by string or integer key at runtime.\n  \nInterestingly, we currently don't do any shenanigans with OnceLock or anything similar. That was my original intention, but because the macro can't offer anything meaningful over doing it yourself, we've elected to adopt the principles of zero-cost abstractions for now and have callers opt-in to whatever object management pattern makes the most sense for their use case. In the future I might add this if I can find a good, clean pattern for it.\n This version is 1.0, but I still have plenty of stuff I want to add. My current priority is reaching approximate feature pairity with the regex crates: useful cargo features for tuning performance and unicode behavior, and a more comprehensive API for variations on find operations.\n    submitted by    /u/Lucretiel  \n [link]   [comments]",

What's the current limitations? I can imagine countless benefits to using it over javascript, but are there any drawbacks to using rust for it over javascript? \n ​\n I know absolutely nothing about it, and my web dev knowledge overall is extremely rusty and likely outdated.

I've found some post on this topic on stackoverflow, but unfortunately the solutions didn't helped in my case or maybe I misunderstood something while trying them out, so I came here to post my issue.\n use bevy::prelude::*; fn main() { App::new() .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins) .add_systems(Update, file_drag_and_drop_system) .run(); } fn file_drag_and_drop_system(mut events: EventReader<FileDragAndDrop>) { for event in events.read() { info!(\"{:? }\", event); } } \n I simply add an addition space after the ? character in the file_drag_and_drop_system function. Then press ctrl + s to save the change and after that use cargo run / cargo build. In both cases cargo recompiles all dependencies.\n The things I've tried so far:\n  \nSome people suggested, that the problem is that the build incremental isn't set to true.\n Others said, that setting the CARGO_TARGET_DIR environmental variable to a different folder might solve the problem.\n  \nconfig.toml in .cargo folder\n Prior to my issue I also set up the cargo.toml file after the Bevy getting started guide.\n [package] name = \"bevy_01\" version = \"0.1.0\" edition = \"2021\" [workspace] resolver = \"2\" # Important! wgpu/Bevy needs this! # NOTE: Remember to remove \"dynamic_linking\" before releasing your game! # Otherwise you will need to include libbevy_dylib alongside your game if you want it to run. # If you remove the \"dynamic\" feature, your game executable can run standalone.

Most of the interviews were 45 min affairs, solving Leetcode style problems (why ?? - that is a separate discussion).\n Sadly, I have come to realize rust is not ideal for this scenario, and going to switch back to C for these coding rounds. Most of these interviews involved working with 2D arrays, linked list, binary trees and such which would be relatively simple in C/C++.\n More context: I have had to spend a good part of the 45 min setting up these primitives, before even trying to solve the core algorithmic challenge. Few reasons:\n  \nThings like coderpad don't let you use external crates (e.g) there is one for 2D arrays\n Some questions involve removing elements from middle of lists in O(1) time. I had to hand roll a doubly linked list with unsafe pointer usage to achieve that, which itself easily filled the time\n  \nWith C/C++, these interviews used to go lot better, uh.

It's entirely written in Rust and orders of magnitude simpler than comparable ML frameworks.\n Recently we've been working on speeding up performance on Nvidia and Apple GPUs, which led us to write compilers capable of generating kernels on the fly. These kernels are compiled once and ran many times, and since the whole compute graph is known at compile time, we can get very aggressive with the kernel optimizations.\n We're adding tons more features (autograd landed a few weeks ago, so training is now possible!) so check out the blog post and the repo if you'd like to know more!\n    submitted by    /u/jafioti  \n [link]   [comments]",

Lately I just avoid adding async at all costs because it just comes with so many caveats and gotchas that the effort is sometimes not worth the performance improvement. Some of the things that I absolutely find annoying:\n  \nasync is not part of rust, it's a library. The main one being Tokio with no real alternative. I applaud the work done on this but it all just feels horribly hacky. \n \nany time you have to use async you taint all your functions and types with it. As if dropping a bucket of paint (worse than paint but let's keep it civil) all over your code. It makes refactoring a horrible experience. As you crawl your codebase to make it async you eventually end up with an impossible task and have to find ugly alternatives (looking at you async fn in traits)\n \nwhile the rust compiler has been an amazing tool along the journey, it just fails miserably with async. It won't complain at all if you forgot to remove a blocking fs call in an async context and of course it will fail horribly at run time. And when the program eventually crashes, it will just render the most obscure stacktrace i've ever seen. FAR from the developper experience of vanilla Rust.\n \n Overall for such a great language with so many features, it just feels broken as soon as you put your finger in the async business. I ve been looking at the async improvement proposals but apart from async fn traits, i just don't see anything revolutionary that would make the experience better. \n At some point, shouldn't it just be part of the language if async Rust is to improve in a major way ? \n Disclaimer: I am not a Rust expert, but i ve been programming for 25+ years in many different languages.\n    submitted by    /u/ArnUpNorth  \n [link]   [comments]",
