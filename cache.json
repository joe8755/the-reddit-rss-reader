This has been nice in that it built a versatility when facing new problems but I feel I have become somewhat a \"Jack of All Trades, Master of None\".\n Recently I have been thinking about what to do about it. First, I don't have a good grasp of the fundamentals (computer organization, assembly, operating systems, algorithms and data structures). So my plan is to try and watch some lectures/read some books on those topics. But I still need to practice.\n What if I practice the same limited set of problems for a while to help me abosrb the fundamentals before moving back to building a bigger project that uses those fundamentals. For example, I could choose the most common data structures and algorithms and just practice implementing them from scratch until they become so easy I almost don't have to think about them.\n What do you think about this approach?

          "description": "I wrote a library for deferred formatting in C. The library was inspired by this rust based deferred formatting library defmt.\n Hope it's okay to post here as this library has two halves, one in C and another in Rust.\n On the C side the library is a header-only library, that requires some modifications to the linker script, and only requires gnu c99 (or maybe even 89) (which is supported by most compilers).\n The C related part sits in cdefmt/include/cdefmt.h\n All of the log strings are being embedded into the resulting `.elf` file. which can be later stripped before being flashed to the device or running on the host.\n The resulting logs are very small, only the size of a pointer per log + whatever arguments were sent to the log.\n Once the device generates the logs, they can be parsed using a library I wrote in rust.\n Given the logs' binary stream and the original elf, the logs can be reconstructed and the parameter's types are inferred from the debugging information encoded in the elf.\n There's support for format hints, enum name lookup and more.\n Currently the code reached a minimum viable product status, there's quite a bit of cleanup and documentation to be done and some missing features to implement, however I thought now would be a good time to share the library and get some feedback.\n An example is provided and validated on a linux system.\n Small example of a log:\n typedef struct some_struct { uint64_t a; uint32_t b; uint16_t c; } some_struct_t; struct some_struct some_struct = { .a = 1234567890123456789, .b = 1234567890, .c = 12345, }; CDEFMT_INFO(\"some struct: {}\", some_struct); \n And the parsed log:\n Info > some struct: {a: 1234567890123456789, b: 1234567890, c: 12345} \n TL;DR: I made a logging library that I think is pretty cool.\n Link: https://github.com/RisinT96/cdefmt\n    submitted by    /u/RisinT96  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to collect insights and compose a learning plan to help them dive in and understand basics and more. To sum it up - I guess I need a pretty detailed roadmap. Also, I think it's important to provide a fair bit of practice. And I personally want this practice be as much interesting, interactive and maybe even fun to do. I know that there are resources as easy-level LeetCode and such, but to my personal preference - it's too early for them to try them out.

My question now is how should I progress and deep my knowledge that it will be possible to do some projects and something relevant, as I find myself always stuck on the basic level of every language and don't to further with developing projects\n My first idea is to practice data structures and algorithms using C and then maybe LeetCode a bit using C. But I want to work with AI later in my career so I searched a bit and apparently I can use C for Image Processing.

Or does it just generate binary for whatever source code is given to it without caring about anything else (except the target platform for which it is designed of course)?\n Also, according to the knowledge I've gathered, it should be totally possible for you to not use the standard library at all (I mean there is literally a nostdlib option in GCC), right? After all it is just a library in the end. There's also the prospect of the runtime library, which I think is just startup and exit routine (crt0.o. Please correct me if I am wrong). Can we also replace this library with our own?

I've been reading some codebases, but haven't been able to decide what is the best way to do the following: I have a function that parses command line arguments:\n struct args { ... bunch of arguments struct some_other_struct* ptrmember; } struct args args_parse(int argc, const char **argv); \n This initial version returns struct args by value. I'm not entirely sure if it is the way to go, since it is a somewhat large struct (5 members), more importantly, the ptrmember member inside needs to be free'd, and it feels like returning a struct by value implies that there is no cleanup needed. I'm also not sure if I should make the caller responsible for free'ing free(args.ptrmember) or have a args_free function which does it.\n Some alternatives that may be better:\n int args_parse(int argc, const char **argv, struct args* out); \n  \nAdded benefit of having return value.\n Allows caller to decide whether to allocate args on heap or put it on stack.\n Still it is not entirely clear as to whether the caller is responsible for free'ing ptrmember I feel like (since it is allocated by args_parse, but the caller initialized the containing struct).\n  \nOr may be the C way is to not use a struct at all and just have a bunch of out parameters like so:\n int args_parse(int argc, const char **argv, enum action* out_action, struct some_other_struct* out_ptrmember); \n  \nThis one makes it very clear that the caller is responsible for freeing out_ptrmember IMO, but I'm not sure if it is best practice to use out variables so liberally here.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/aangebrandpannenkoek  \n [link]   [comments]",

So why on earth arr[i] works?\n \n ```c\n int main(void) { int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\n printArray(arr, size); printArrayPointer(arr, size); printArrayPointerArithmetic(arr, size);\n return 0; }\n void printArray(int arr[], int size) { for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { printf(\"%d \", arr[i]); } printf(\"\\n\"); }\n void printArrayPointer(int *arr, int size) { for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { printf(\"%d \", arr[i]); } printf(\"\\n\"); }\n void printArrayPointerArithmetic(int *arr, int size) { for (int *ptr = arr; ptr < arr + size; ptr++) { printf(\"%d \", *ptr); } printf(\"\\n\"); } ```\n    submitted by    /u/abstrscat  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thanks everyone I got some validation that what I was thinking is not so strange, and I think I know how to write that wrapper now :) Appreciated. \n I'm making a program that splits a file into n pieces and then merges them in which hopefuly the resulting file will be the exact same as original file.\n So far I can\n  \nRead the input file\n Split into n pieces\n Write pieces out as files.\n  \nFor this I'm using a few mallocs. For which I have to do error checking , something like if `ptr== NULL`, return\n void allocCheck(void *ptr){ if(ptr == NULL){ fprintf(stderr, \"Error allocating memory\\n\"); _exit(-1); } } int main(int argc, char *argv[argc + 1]){ char *buf; int itemsRead; int *pieceSize; char **paths; int nSplit = 20; // Number of splits, hardcoded for now. //Dinamic allocation. buf = malloc(sizeof(char) * MAX_FILE_SIZE); allocCheck(buf); pieceSize = malloc(sizeof(int) * nSplit); allocCheck(pieceSize); paths = malloc(sizeof(char *) * nSplit); allocCheck(paths); for(size_t i = 0; i < nSplit; i++){ paths[i] = malloc(sizeof(char) * MAX_PATH_SIZE); allocCheck(paths[i]); } //program function. itemsRead = readFile(PATH, buf); split(nSplit, itemsRead, pieceSize, paths); for(size_t i = 0; i < nSplit; i++){ writeFile(buf, paths[i], pieceSize[i]); } //freeing allocations free(buf); free(pieceSize); for(size_t i = 0; i < nSplit; i++){ free(paths[i]); } free(paths); return EXIT_SUCCESS; } \n I made this function for error checking on allocations, to avoid extra clutter as I want my main function to be as clean as possible.\n  \nIs this even a good practice?\n Is it posible to do the mallocs on its own .c file? I wanted to do something like mem.c and mem.h and just move all that into its own file. Including the Null check.\n  \nperhaps something like a wrapper `myalloc( void *pointer, size_t size)` But I don't think is right using *void... and I do need to specify the type of pointer I'll be allocating.\n How would you do it?\n    submitted by    /u/Rynok_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Which makes the call complicated for the compiler to optimize and then continues to make the processors job harder, by making it more likely to mis-predict the function call and thus waste cycles restarting the pipeline. Restarting the pipeline can take 5 to 15 cycles. A modern processor executes about 2 instructions per cycle. If you need to interface two pieces of code together that are not developed at the same time by the same people, use a header file. Let the compiler and linker collapse the abstraction away, so the processor isn't bothered by extra work and an unpredictable workload.\n  \nMy question is what does this look like in practice? What is a simple example showing how one header file can extend the functionality of another header file similar to virtual methods in a language like Java?

First element is a float *. */ return (float **)rtn; } int ArrayLength(void *_data) { struct Alloc { union { void *raw; /* <-- There is no float * here. But 6.2.7 says char * is compatible */ } u; int size; }; /* * 2) Valid? Never accesses union. */ struct Alloc *data = _data; return data->size; } int main() { float **arr = FloatArrayCreate(); /* * 3) Valid? [0] accesses first element (float *), [2] access 3rd element of float *. */ printf(\"Size: %i %f\\n\", ArrayLength(arr), arr[0][2]); return 0; } \n    submitted by    /u/pedersenk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Although not strictly necessary in functional programming, I like to maintain the dependency inversion principle by using dependency injection to maintain control inversion and keep my modules independent from each other. Practically I've always achieved this by always having some kind of \"init\" function in all but my highest level modules that accepts function pointers. This allows the higher level modules that are dependent on this module to \"inject\" pointers to \"callback\" functions.\n I found myself questioning if passing these functions pointers at runtime, given that I don't ever expect them to change, is really the optimal solution here. Alternative ways to achieve this that I can think of are forward declaring the function I need, or just having circular dependencies. These both seems to significantly complicate life for the linker and feel I like that's bad practice.\n Actually, I guess I don't really understand why you would ever forward declare a function vs just giving the external function a header and including that, maybe that's part of the issue here?\n Maybe I'm architecting this fundamentally wrong, or maybe I'm just over thinking things, I'd love any feedback.\n Edit: I probably should have a given a code example from the beginning:\n main.c\n include \"timer.h\" void timerCallback(void){ doThings(); } int main(void){ initTimer(timerCallback); startTimer(); } \n timer.h\n void initTimer(void(*callback)(void)); void startTimer(void); \n timer.c\n include \"timer.h\" static void(*execCallback)(void); void initTimer(void(*callback)(void)){ execCallback = callback; } void startTimer(void){ wait(1000); execCallback(); } \n Its kind of a dumb example it gets the point across, I'm basically asking what the optimal way is to call the timerCallback func defined in main from timer.c\n    submitted by    /u/MikeExMachina  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! I am trying to understand how constness works for double pointers, and so far, my answer is \"it doesn't\".\n From what I've read, the way the const qualifier works for a pointer is that if the const qualifier is before the *, then the constness applies to the thing being pointed at, while if the const qualifier is after the * then it applies to the pointer itself. Therefore a const int * is a pointer that you can have point to multiple things without issue, but cannot change the value being pointed at. For double pointers, the logic I have says that const int ** dp is a double pointer where you can edit dp, dp[0], but not dp[0][0]. and const int *const * dp means I can change dp, but neither dp[0], nor dp[0][0]. However, when I actually use this, I get weird compiler errors that tell …",

I have learned C for almost a decade and I know a lot of things about memory, CPU, pointers, binary etc etc. I can reason about C code and I can investigate and study it. I can write small programs and functions with ease, but I have troubles when it comes to building an actual application.\n When I write code for projects it feels as if I'm doing everything wrong. I seem to be obsessed with details and I have a hard time focusing on the big picture. It seems that whatever I do, in a matter of days I'd scratch everything and start all over again. Imagine you are an artist and you have a blank canvas and you sketch something, but then you hate it and you destroy the whole canvas. I've been doing that over and over with my coding.\n So how do I actually program? I'm talking about developing solid software projects rather than toying around with code. If there are good resources on the matter, I'd be extremely happy to study them, from my searches a lot of the things I've found seem to be either overly abstract and corporate or they seem to be very surface level and not what I'm looking for.

And for me that's the problem, if I'm not forced to do things in a simple way, I know that at some point I will give in to the temptation and start using containers, templates, class hierarchies, etc. The only way to \"force\" myself to do things in a simple manner, is to just use C instead.\n Anybody else relates to this?\n    submitted by    /u/FACastello  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've used the search engine quite a bit and \"TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 1)\" seems to be an indispensable tome in the world of networking books, as is \"UNIX Network Programming.\" But opinions seem to be split on \"TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 2).\" Here's a few excerpts from three different threads:\n  \nTCP/IP vol 1 is excellent for understanding how networking works and should really be read before learning about sockets. The vol 2 you don't normally read, but rather just skim it if you have time.\n \nI’ve only read Unix Network Programming Volume 1. But Unix Network Programming pairs very well with Volume 2 of the illustrated series.\n \nVolumes 2 and 3 are more about the actual code used to implement the protocols, so unless you're going to be writing such code (or are just curious), you can probably safely skip those.\n \n The preface to UNIX Network Programming itself claims that TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 2) is a good complimentary read:\n  \nTCPv2 contains a high level of detail very closely related to the material in this book, as it describes and presents the actual 4.4BSD implementation of the network programming functions for the sockets API (socket, bind, connect, and so on). If one understands the implementation of a feature, the use of that feature in an application makes more sense.\n  \nSo is it fair to assume that I should read TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 1), then TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 2), and finally UNIX Network Programming, or is that overkill? From what I could glean, the general opinion is that TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 1) and UNIX Network Programming seem to be enough. Any help is greatly appreciated, please keep in mind that I'm going for the most comprehensive understanding of this stuff possible.\n    submitted by    /u/piracema  \n [link]   [comments]",

But assuming it is, my next assertion is then: \"the world's foremost expert in c could look at my code; detect unsafe practices; and render it safe.\n And if that is all true, then I am puzzled why a machine can't do that for me (us). Isn't that something the compiler should be doing? And if that's too difficult, surely AI can be trained to know the patterns of unsafe code and require the programmer to explicitly reject the proferred 'corrections' and insist upon compiling the code as is. Isn't that what Rust basically does (e.g. permit the programmer to write in 'unsafe mode'?)\n I assume what I propose cannot be done or it already would be done. But for the life of me, I cannot figure out where my logic breaks down. Can someone help educate me why unsafe c code can't be identified by a machine (compiler or other AI code)?\n edit: 10:38: To clarify, I guess I am asking: aren't most 'unsafe practices' something that follow certain patterns that someone who has coded in c for a living for a sufficient number of years would be able to detect right away? And if there are patterns, can't those patterns be put into code for a machine to detect instead of a human? Is 'problem code' so obtuse in its potential variations that it isn't possible to articulate the patterns?\n    submitted by    /u/ill-fatedcopper  \n [link]   [comments]",

( There is an approach to explain this technically: since &a == &a[0], because the array points to the first element, and &a[0] is the same as &a, so &a == &a, and since the & operator and the * operator cancel &a == a) \n Sorry, english is not my native language, I hope my question is still clear. \n Also I kind of think it is funny that &a, a, &a[0], *a, a[0] and &a[0][0] all point to the same address but all have different types. \n    submitted by    /u/whazzabui  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "RSGL is a versatile cross-platform graphics library designed for simplicity and convenience. It offers features like shape drawing, text rendering, and customizable widgets. With no external dependencies and a modular structure, it provides flexibility for various projects. \n Although RSGL is a graphics library, it only handles graphics data. rendering must be done externally of RSGL.h. By default, RSGL includes RSGL_gl.h which is a opengl backend for RSGL. \n RSGL also includes a small window abstraction over RGFW but you can use any windowing library with RSGL. RSGL includes an example for using RSGL with GLFW.\n Other than being very dynamic and modular in use, RSGL is also designed to be very lightweight, the current release, this includes compiled binaries, is only ~500kb and the header itself is only 120kb. \n Here is a simple example of how to use RSGL\n #define RSGL_IMPLEMENTATION #include \"RSGL.h\" int main(void) { // create a window at the center of the screen RSGL_window* win = RSGL_createWindow(\"name\", (RSGL_rect){500, 500, 500, 500}, RSGL_CENTER); // create a toggle rounded button in light mode RSGL_button toggle = RSGL_initButton(); RSGL_button_setPolygon(&toggle, RSGL_RECT(50, 125, 100, 50), 36); RSGL_button_setStyle(&toggle, RSGL_STYLE_LIGHT | RSGL_STYLE_TOGGLE | RSGL_STYLE_ROUNDED); // while the should should stay open while (RGFW_window_shouldClose(win) == false) { // loop through each event to avoid lag while (RSGL_window_checkEvent(win)) { // check button info RSGL_button_update(&toggle, win->event); } // draw a rectangle RSGL_drawRect(RSGL_RECT(200, 200, 200, 200), RSGL_RGB(255, 0, 0)); // draw the button RSGL_drawButton(toggle); // clear the screen (and render) RSGL_window_clear(win, RSGL_RGB(100, 100, 100)); } // close the window and free everything RSGL_window_close(win); } \n    submitted by    /u/Comrade-Riley  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am writing code to heuristically solve a mathematical problem (a network partitioning problem). The code starts with an initial partition, and then tries various strategies (about 15 strategies) to improve the partition.\n Some of these strategies can be used in any order. Some are reasonable to use only after some other ones have been tried. Some can be used inside or outside other strategies.\n These strategies are more or less useful depending on the type of network that is given. Hence, I would like to give the user as much freedom as possible in mixing and matching these strategies, but I am not sure how to best structure that in the code.\n An example: say the strategies are A, B, C, D. Then I would like to user to be able to select:\n  \nA only\n A then C then B\n B then A then C\n A with C enabled inside, then D, then C again.\n A with C disabled inside, then C.\n  \netc. Another complication is that some of these strategies (like A and D) require some data structures to be maintained, while others (like B and C) don't. So if A and D are done consecutive then I don't want to re-build the data structures, but if A and D are not consecutive, then I do want to re-build them.\n Is there any general advice you can give for this situation, or a code base or book I can look at for inspiration?\n Thank you very much.\n    submitted by    /u/LearningStudent221  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have no idea how file streams work but I don't think it would be very hard to change that if I wanted to. \n Liberal inspiration was taken from from this post, all the heavy lifting was done there, I just added the va_arg parsing and the logic for the flags. \n Any feedback would help because I have no idea if I have taken bad approaches on this project or if the code is even readable.\n My main concern is the testing approach I have taken, I think it is pretty bad, it was tedious to wrote and is very error prone, so there might be bugs in my code I'm not even aware of.\n  \nNote: the coding convention is not my own, it is my school's, so the code will probably look very weird to most of you, I personally don't like it but that's just how it is.. \n Try not to take stylistic choices too much into consideration if you review my code but absolutely feel free to point out odd things or stuff you would not recommend doing in general. \n Here is a very brief (not exhaustive) summary of the coding guidelines I had to work with: \n  \n4 spaced tabs for indentation\n 25 lines per function max\n 80 columns max\n 5 functions per .c file max\n 4 named parameters per function max\n C89 style variable declarations\n for loops, switch case, goto are forbidden\n  \nIf you want a good laugh I can also send you the entire pdf lol.\n    submitted by    /u/ismbks  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was curious about regexp's and ended up with a search-engine!\n So, I was curious as to how regular expressions could be created, and I started out with chapter 5 in Software Tools in Pascal by Kernighan and Plauger. It was a good read, and I did convert the code to C before I did the exercises. Implementing a not operator for a match, was one of the exercises, as was implementing an 'all patterns must match functionality, and an any patterns must match. I cobbled these pieces together and ended up with relational operators. It is not very usable in its current form, but it was fun still.\n I'm out of time at the moment, as this was a little sideshow, and frankly I have no ambition of adding a lot of features, I plan on using it in a pipeline with ripgrep, and maybe xargs. Hopefully someone finds it interesting, and critique is welcome.\n    submitted by    /u/McUsrII  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Ladies and gentlemen, I've finally done it! I've written my first program in C, something similar to the Unix \"cat\" utility. Before this, it was just a couple of simple algorithms in college, years ago. Now the program is only 50 lines long, but it introduced me to so many new concepts: pointers, error handling, streams, and standards. Jesus, standard C doesn't know about directories! Maybe I will be ashamed of this post later, but right now, I'm really proud of myself. I plan to implement more Unix utilities in the future.\n For some reason, I decided to learn C programming as my latest hobby. It can be difficult to find time in my routine, but I managed to complete \"Modern C\" by Jens Gustedt, skipping all the exercises, though. I didn't want to make the reading take forever. I wanted to experience programming at its best.\n Review my code, please:\n /* Get file name through argument and print its content to stdout.

Now, instead of all threads having to finish all of their work, I want to stop the others when one of them finds a solution and returns.\n So previously I didn't need any synchronisation, I could simply join all threads in any order in main because I would have to wait for all of them to finish anyway. But now I want to signal/message/abort/kill all the other threads when one of them returns. Because the threads are completely independent, I don't think I need any condition variables, mutexes or message queues. What I did is: have one global atomic bool running = true and set it to false in one thread when a solution is found. The other threads check for this condition in their inner loop (so, often) and return when it's false.\n This works, but is it the best solution? Polling the global bool so often seems wasteful, but is signalling/messaging a better option? And I'm not quite sure where to start.

Iot malware, such as mirai, gayfgt etc\n Ive noticed recently alot of malware tries to kill other malware. Since malware is C code (generally) compiled statically. Alot of malware killers are infecting the device, then there method of “killing” is killing any process that is statically compiled (always malware) the method used is looking in the processes maps file for strings such as “.so” & “/lib/“ to detect if a process is static, if its compiled statically they kill the process.\n My question is; why are malware owners doing this to kill other running malware? Is this a safe option killing all static processes? Are some important/crucial processes compiled statically on Linux? \n Very interested to hear your thoughts \n    submitted by    /u/ryanjones42  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's like buying a whole pizza and then throwing away 7 out of 8 slices just because you're \"not that hungry.\"\n And don't even get me started on the sheer inefficiency. In a world where every nanosecond and bit of memory counts, C is just out here throwing bytes around like they grow on trees. You might as well be programming on an abacus for all the efficiency you're getting. Think about all the extra memory you're using – it's like driving a Hummer to deliver a single envelope.\n It's 2024, people! We have the technology to optimize every single bit of our programs, but C is stuck in the past, clinging to its archaic ways. I mean, what's next? Are we going to use 8-track tapes for data storage again? Get with the program, C!\n Honestly, the fact that C still gets used is a mystery. I can't even look at a C codebase without cringing at the sheer wastefulness.

          "description": "I know quite a bit about C, and I'm an average user of Linux, however sometimes I get stuck on things that look esoteric to me despite having some knowledge in the matter.\n For instance, I found this C code here:\n #include <stdlib.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <resolv.h> #include <netdb.h> #include <string.h> int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { struct addrinfo *result = NULL; int rc; struct addrinfo hint; if (argc < 2) { printf (\"Usage: %s hostname\\n\", argv[0]); exit(1); } printf (\"Resolving \\\"%s\\\"... \", argv[1]); memset(&hint, 0 , sizeof (hint)); hint.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; rc = getaddrinfo (argv[1], NULL, &hint, &result); printf (\"result: %d\\n\", rc); } \n The code looks quite simple, the problem comes to its compilation that seems to require a special kind of compiler, like so:\n ./toolchain-mips_34kc_gcc-4.8-linaro_musl-1.1.2/bin/mips-openwrt-linux-gcc getaddr.c -DNEED_PRINTF -o getaddr_tplink \n Here is where I don't know what to do, do I install this with the typical sudo apt install?

          "description": "Very memory conscious applications may consider cramming data into (usually the highest bits of) pointers. Most 64 bit systems support 48 bit virtual addresses, leaving room for a 2 bytes of data. This obviously comes at the cost of portability.\n However, if the program is aware at compile time of its maximum memory requirement (and assumes some fragmentation overhead), it should be able to restrict its virtual address space via setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS, &rlim) , ensuring a program defined number of bits in pointers are usable.\n For example, say I know my program will never use more than 6 GiB. Then its VA space could be confined to 8 GiB (33 bit addresses). This ensures I get 31 bits for data in my pointers:\n unsigned long long MAX_ADDR = (1ull<<34) - 1; const struct rlimit { rlim_t rlim_cur; rlim_t rlim_max; } r = { MAX_ADDR, MAX_ADDR}; setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS, &r); \n One specific application (that prompted the idea) are bitmap tries, where the alphabet size imposes whether the bitmap of a node can be stored within the pointer or has to be a separate field (also taking up memory due to alignment).\n Thoughts? Is this a decent idea for making tagged pointers portable or squeezing more memory?\n    submitted by    /u/_radu_b  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I've run into a problem that I can't really wrap my head around. If I try moving the cursor to the end of a line with tabs, the cursor will stop too early. Therefore, I thought maybe I should replace the tab characters for each line of the file, but then I remembered Vim. Vim can change the 'shiftwidth' of the tab character (i.e 8 spaces get turned into 2 spaces according to the shiftwidth variable) without directly affecting the line itself! So I'm wondering how I can implement this in my own program and allow the cursor to adjust to the tab size?\n For reference, here's the source code for my program if anyone's interested: https://github.com/MoolsDogTwo/Centi\n Buffer & cursor functions are in their respective c & h files.

          "description": "I'm currently writing some multi-threaded code with a client-server model-- initial thread is the server, which spawns client threads, and all interthread communication is done through the server. All threads share some global variables which are primarily used for signaling, the simplest example being a boolean flag which signals a global shutdown. Only one thread (the server) will ever write to this flag, and once set it remains set until all threads return, but many threads will read it many times in a hot loop before this happens, so I'd like to optimize those reads as much as possible.\n I'm fairly new to multi-threaded programming, but from what I've read, data races are primarily caused by one thread reading after the write has begun but before the write has finished, causing partially written data to be read. However, in this case it is a single byte being written, only one thread is the writer, only the transition from 0 to 1 needs to be detected, and that detection doesn't need to be perfectly synchronized between threads because the value will stay the same until all threads have reacted to it.\n I can't see a way that anything bad will happen if I just use a non-atomic bool, but again, I'm new to this and I don't want to introduce a subtle bug that might bite me suddenly down the line; every relevant search result I've found says to always use atomic operations by default, but they're using more complex data types. I can't imagine how a bool can ever be in a partially updated state so I feel fairly safe using a non-atomic bool, but is there something I'm missing? And if a non-atomic bool is safe, at what point does a non-atomic one-writer many-readers variable become unsafe? I imagine that depends on architecture (data bus size, etc.), so should I just assume anything larger than a bool requires atomic accesses only?\n    submitted by    /u/poorlilwitchgirl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Notice how C and C++ aren't even from the same country, yet they can do all of the same things? Regardless of their origins, because C++ was built on C, you need to write libraries in C to support the functions of C++, if you don't have the standard libraries already. Even then, some older systems with separate I/Ospace don't let you too easily write interactive (or reactive) programs for them in C; luckily you can include assembly files for them to fit your hardware.\n One key difference in C functions from their C++ counterparts is how C++ replaces the target object of a function with a pointer named \"this\". That's its actual name; the indefinite demonstrative pronoun fits for being the object of which the function is a member in C++.\n Templates aren't exclusive to C++ either; in C you can imitate them with macros, that while they may destroy type safety, can still be used for dynamic dimensionality or objects whose size is dependent on a parameter. These are, of course, object-like macros. Sadly, most folks tend to forego both object-like and function-like macros and only define simple values or even just dummies whose only purpose is to satisfy preprocessor conditions and compile code within. In fact, using object-like and function-like macros in C, I do recommend the practice of adding types as arguments for as many different types are in your functions. You can actually do that as it's only ever the preprocessor that sees them.\n C can do encapsulation too, but requires objects to be in separate files included by a \"root\" file for it, whereas C++ has classes. Members in branch files are \"private\" if instantiated and \"protected\" if static. Members in the root file are \"public\". Trouble is that even C++ hasn't a type of class whose members are \"protected\" by default.\n    submitted by    /u/Moist_Internet_1046  \n [link]   [comments]",

I do this to implement \"hot reload\" for those set of functions. It did not work at first, because myshared.c referenced functions from mylib.c, and it obviously does not have the location of those symbols when it gets hotloaded (myshared.c was not a shared object at first. It was just a standardly linked object, linked in the main step).\n As an experiment, I modified the above to be the following:\n main: mylib.o libmyshared.so gcc -o main mylib.o main.c # Made the code position idependent mylib.o: mylib.c gcc -fPIC -c mylib.c # ADDED mylib.o as dependency libmyshared.so: mylib.o myshared.c gcc -fPIC -shared -o mylib.o libmyshared.so myshared.c \n I was surprised to see that the program \"worked\" properly (though it may only be working \"by accident\"). My thought was that both main and the libmyshared.so binary would have their own in-memory copy of mylib.o and the program wouldn't work properly. That said, all of the memory is owned by the main.c code, so mylib.c and libmyshared.so does not have any state of its own.\n My questions are: 1. In this configuration, are there two copies of mylib.o at runtime (e.g. one owned by main and the other owned by libmyshared.so)? I guess the symbols are just compiled into the binary, so there is just duplicate code. 2. Would making mylib.o into a shared object remedy that problem (i.e. make it only use one copy)?\n    submitted by    /u/haskell_account  \n [link]   [comments]",

I solved it quickly with 5 nested loops which helped him I think, although I don't think he anticipated that there were no less than 277 different working combinations, ha!\n I also made a much shorter program in Python based on itertools.combinations but it was excruciatingly slow. So I wanted to make a similar function in C, and I did. Successive calls to the function return a pointer to an array of K distinct numbers, each time the next combination in lexicographical order of an \"N take K\" set. The last call, or a call with invalid arguments, frees the memory used by the function internally.\n I implemented Donald Knuth's algorithm from his book The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4A, §7.2.1.3, algorithm T, page 359. The only thing is that his lexicographical order goes from highest to lowest number, while we usually want to process the array in ascending order, so it's only really ordered if you reverse it. That is different from the Python version and the nested loops version. Ah well.\n Let me know what you think!

The general layout of the primary data structure is thus:\n struct global_data{ float *data; struct data *table; size_t size_data; size_t size_table; }; \n where data is a table of single precision values, table is a dynamic table structure, and size_data denotes the size of the data, and size_table denotes the number of struct data structs.\n The implementation of struct data is:\n struct data{ float *data[COL]; }; \n Each data struct will represent a specific matrix of data.\n The goal is to have a dynamic table of data to work with and pass around a specific part of some data processing program; the idea is to not have to call malloc k-times and have a fragmented heap.\n What goes on is the following:\n 1) Input the number of unique matrices\n 2) Allocate all relevant data : *table by way of number of matrices; *data for the total number of matrix elements\n 3) Link *data from struct data to specific segment of *data found in struct global_data.\n This is based on the current implementation. The next implementation is to have the *data field within struct data to be dynamic: based on some k-dimensional array or arbitrary size, as determined by the user input, rather than predefined by the const definition of COL.\n The idea is to alias specific regions of some single-allocated table to pointers within another data structure, who determines the size of its own data to work with.\n What would you recommend I do to best approach this? The main issue I seem to have is the next implementation may need to account fro k-deep for loops for k-dimensional data structures. That may not be realistic. Another way is to perform algebra on the aliased pointers to access specific regions, but I'm not sure if that is the best way of approaching this problem due to the issue of readability and the increased risk of segmentation faults.\n    submitted by    /u/learnin_too_code  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I didn't find anything super recent that dealt with this, so I figured I'd ask... apologies if this is the wrong place for this question! I'll remove this post if so.\n I haven't done any C or C++ since 2013-ish and want to pick the languages back up. Back then I had just finished school and briefly worked a job at a small shop where, being the lone C++ dev working entirely on my own, I learned nothing about best practices or anything, so I basically just installed dependencies locally and linked against them, and maybe ran valgrind every once in a blue moon, etc. I figure maybe that wasn't the best way to handle things, or even if it was maybe things have changed since then.\n Anyway, I was recently offered some work on a project and one of the requirements is that it must be either C or C++ and want to take a look at both again so I can decide which one I should use (plus I'm interested in exploring the game development field), so my question is: what's the most popular setup for a C/C++ dev environment? I'm talking besides IDE's/Text Editors, also tools for dependency management, static analysis, memory debugging/analysis, linters, etc. Basically anything people who are pros use to boost their productivity especially when they might be using the same PC for working on several projects... I'm on Windows 11, but also have WSL2 set up with Ubuntu, which means either Windows or Ubuntu setups should work for me.

Lambdas are able to take the reference or a copy of everything in the current scope. Lambdas are also syntatic sugar to create a structure with an overloaded operator ().

This is not a great setup fro debugging.\n So I tried to reproduce this on my Mac, I installed GCC 14, and after recompiling everything the tests don't fail...\n Since I also have cross compilation images for armv5 and armv7, I tried the code on those and the tests also don't fail.\n Even if I try to compile the test code shown above on x86-64, it fails, but on armv5 and armv7 it works.\n The question is why?\n I would expect that the evaluation order to be done by the front-end of the compiler.

But it seems more logical to keep all declrations in the header and have this seperation.\n The second solution\n Ok, the next solution is to define everything and initialize in the header like this:\n ```cpp // consts.hpp\n pragma once\n const float PI = 3.14; ```\n It seems a better solution, but I kinda just don't like initializing in the header file; Also I am not sure how exactly #pragma once works, so, could it lead to some linker errors if I include consts.hpp in several files? As long as I know, it's gonna copy the content of header to files, does it mean I'll get several definitions of the const PI in multiple files? Each object will get its own constant? Or it corrects it and it's not just a simple straight forward copy?\n Thanks for your opinions.\n Edit: I am also curious about your opinion about inline variables and constexpr for this thing.\n    submitted by    /u/ArtinIr    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I inherited a C library that I have no control over. In that library, there is one struct, and one function that I really care about. To simplify my problem, assume I have a struct:\n struct oldStruct {\n // other stuff\n unsigned char* bigarray;\n };\n Later on, I need to pass an array of oldStructs to the function I care about like so:\n coolFunction(const oldStruct* structarrayptr, // other stuff);\n So my question is basically, how can I C++ify things for safety. I already have a vector<oldStruct> and then pass to coolFunction(vector<oldStruct>.data(), ...) and that all works. But I'd really like to somehow wrap the unsigned char* bigarray in a unique_ptr, and I can't figure out how.\n I even tried making\n struct newStruct{\n // same other stuff\n std::unique_ptr<unsigned char> bigarray;\n };\n which is already dumb for just duplicating code. I was able to construct my vector<newStruct> and use it elsewhere and everything worked great, but the issue was when I tried to pass to coolFunction that it failed. There was no casting I could figure out that would cast newStruct to oldStruct. The issue I guess is that C++ isn't smart enough to use unique_ptr.get() to get the dumb pointer.\n What is the \"right\" way to deal with this situation?

Instead, symbolEvaluationOrder provides the order to evaluate the operators in, so if symbolEvaluationOrder = { 0, 1 } then that means the expression must be evaluated as (2 - 4) * 7 = -14 while if symbolEvaluationOrder = { 1, 0 } then the expression is evaluated as 2 - (4 * 7) = -26.\n With three integers this is easy.

          "description": "Today I stumbled over this warning message while tinkering with placement new in a larger project. To give a small outline of the scope: The goal was to create an error system in an embedded project with -fno-exception and avoiding expensive heap allocations. This is where the placement-new operator comes into play, because it allows creating abstracted error objects. Errors are global and stateful (hence the abstraction) and require a central user-defined location where these are stored. This requirement should be enforced at compile time.\n To find a solution I thought of enforcing a user-defined storage object using an extern declaration, which would throw a linker error if missing. But during testing I noticed that I instead got the compile warning (turned to an error via -Werror) from the title. The setup for that is very specific and also only works with non-zero optimization (-Og or -O1-3) \n So this got me wondering if there is any way to detect a missing storage location at compile time except linker warnings, so that I can provide a custom error message, because this pointer is null doesnt really tell the user anything, whereas undefined reference to storage does.\n I tried to narrow down the error and got the following code. Every line marked with // - was necessary to optimize for that warning.\n // compiled with g++ -c -O1 test.cpp #include <cstdint> #include <cstdio> #include <new> union Storage; static // - Storage *_StoragePtr; inline // - void setStorage(Storage *s) { _StoragePtr = s; } struct Error { virtual // - int foo() { return 1; } }; extern union Storage { Storage() { setStorage(this); } Error data; // example } storage; // user defined storage object // Storage storage; // - int main() { Error *error = new (_StoragePtr) Error(); printf(\"%i\", error->foo()); // - auto stuff = error->foo(); // - } \n    submitted by    /u/Symbroson    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to teach myself Cpp and I'm reading \"C++ Primer\" 5th Edition, and doing the exercises, and I just did exercise 1.4 where I converted an \"add two integers\" program into a \"multiply two integers\" program. I made the revisions, and built it without error, and ran it without error, at least on a variety of integers up to 4 digits long.\n But when I put in two larger integers (specifically, 56,789 and 67,890) the program ran and gave an answer that was not only the wrong number, but also was wrong in that it was negative (see screenshot below).\n https://i.ibb.co/648LVB5/Screenshot-20240615-140505.jpg\n Can anyone tell me why this happened? Could it be because the memory reserved for the calculation was not large enough for a product that had 10 digits?\n Also, I'm curious why I got a return value of 0 when there was clearly an error in the calculation somewhere.\n Finally, can anyone offer any advice on how to run down errors like this on my own without bugging redditors? Is there a facility within the Code::Blocks IDE that might help, for example?\n Thank you in advance for any help.\n    submitted by    /u/Max-Queue    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

The closures are already done, but I am stuck on compiling recursive union types, so I need some help on how to do it.\n The way the question is going, I get the sense it is just going to be ignored, but I'd really want the language to support heap allocated recursive union types (like the ones F# has) in the Cuda backend, so I am reposting it here for visibility.\n Edit: It got resolved and it turns out it is a weird NVRTC related issue.

Since I couldn't find the problem online and I can't reach the professor who showed it to me I thought I would exploit the law of large numbers and simulate a large number of cases to see if the statistics were at all close to the value I had calculated. The problem was: out of 6 dice throws what is the probability of obtaining only two numbers that don't repeat? (meaning the other four are either all the same or two same couples) This is the code I wrote to simulate the situation but I found that after a big enough number of cases the \"random\" dice throws start to repeat. ls there a better way to simulate such a situation?\n here is the code:\n #includ…",

My motivation stems from the current limitations of std::thread in terms of customization and the complexities encountered when applying std::async and std::future to classes and containers.\n I aim to streamline concurrent programming by introducing more intuitive and flexible APIs, reducing boilerplate code, and enhancing performance through intelligent resource management akin to thread pools. This new module would not replace but complement existing standards, offering developers a more powerful toolset for managing concurrency in modern, complex applications.\n I'm eager to gauge the C++ community's thoughts on this proposal.

I am looking for a memory pool to allocate the various derived nodes with, but also properly destructs all the allocated nodes (as in via their destructors). For context, at some point in the program I want to destroy all the trees I have created hence why I think a memory pool would be a good way to deallocate all memory at once.\n Previously I naively used boost::pool<> and allocated the derived classes with it via new (pool.malloc()) ChildNode1 before realising the pool had no concept of the data it was storing so naturally their destructors were not called and data with additional allocations like vectors/strings were not being cleaned up.\n Next I looked at using boost::object_pool<Base> however that does not compile as the Base class is virtual.\n Looking for suggestions on how this might be achieved (with or without libraries). I'm aware that I could use a std::map<std::unique_ptr<Base>> and just grab the raw point to the node, but I would like the nodes to be allocated within blocks.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/flcosmic    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all.\n I am implementing a tree like data structure with a node base class and multiple derived classes. I am looking for a memory pool to allocate the various derived nodes with, but also properly destructs all the allocated nodes (as in via their destructors). For context, at some point in the program I want to destroy all the trees I have created hence why I think a memory pool would be a good way to deallocate all memory at once.\n Previously I naively used boost::pool<> and allocated the derived classes with it via new (pool.malloc()) ChildNode1 before realising the pool had no concept of the data it was storing so naturally their destructors were not called and data with additional allocations like vectors/strings were not being cleaned up.\n Next I looked at using boost::object_pool<Base> however that does not compile as the Base class is virtual.\n Looking for suggestions on how this might be achieved (with or without libraries). I'm aware that I could use a std::map<std::unique_ptr<Base>> and just grab the raw point to the node, but I would like the nodes to be allocated within blocks. \n Thanks. \n    submitted by    /u/flcosmic    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

The program runs, but I wan't to be able to enter the expression with or without spaces. Right now I'm using getline to get the expression from the user and then stringstream ss(expression) to parse the expression so I can get the operands and operators. I sotre operators as a char in stack a, and operands as a double in stack b. Then a switch function to do the math.\n  double applyOp(double a, double b, char op) { switch (op) { case '+': return a + b; case '-': return a - b; case '*': return a * b; case '/': return a / b; case '^': return pow(a, b); default: return 0; }  Currently I have to enter the expression as: 4 * ( 3 + 21 ); instead of: 4*(3+ 21). Another thing is this makes working with negative numbers slightly more difficult. I cannot enter: 3 * - 2 (no matter how I space it). Instead I have to enter any negative number as ( 0 - 2 ), which as you can imagine is very tedious. I want to be able to distinguish the numbers based on if there is an operator between them. Any suggestions are welcome.\n Also side note, for formatting code I only know of the ``` method, but I've heard it doesn't work for all versions of reddit.

The website mentions the compiler may also choose to evaluate a constexpr function at compile-time in a context that does not require a constant expression. So, I try to practice that with std::is_constant_evaluated whether the contexpr function will be evaluated at compile time when it does not require a constant expression or not. Just for curious.\n Here is my code\n ```cpp\n include <type_traits>\n include <iostream>\n constexpr int compute(int x) { if (std::is_constant_evaluated()) { return x * x; // Compile-time branch } else { return x + x; // Runtime branch } }\n int main() { int result {compute(5)}; std::cout << \"Result: \" << result << std::endl; return 0; } ```\n I noticed that the website said gcc with -O2 compiler option will evaluate a constexpr function which isn't required constant expression at compile time. So I use the -O2 option to make the compiler evaluate.\n I expected that the result would be 25 when the constexpr function was evaluated at compile time. However, it returns 10. Obviously, this function was evaluated at runtime. I don't know why this happens.

Mainly for my self at the moment, but Im considering if there would be market for the solution. My solution would be an desktop GUI app, as well as shipped with CLI available binary (for servers aka CI/CD).\n The protector would work as follows:\n  \nLoad your binary into the protector.\n Select the protection mechanisms out of available in the protector GUI.\n Optionally save protection presets for future use, or for CLI use as well.\n Export protected binary\n  \nThe protection features would be:\n  \nAnti-debuggers protection\n Strings obfuscations\n Import obfuscations\n Code flow / disassembly obfuscations\n Anti-VM protection\n On the fly License Manager (create/modify a user licensed by EMAIL + KEY or HWID)\n Binary size compression\n  \nThe protector itself would be fully cross-platform solution. Meaning that the GUI and CLI tool could run the same way on Windows, Linux and MacOS machines. So the Linux host can manage Windows, MacOS and Linux binaries and vice-versa.\n At the beginning I would support only Windows binary protection, meaning that the protection of Windows EXE and DLL only would be available at the beggining. No Linux ELF executables, and no MacOS Mach-Os - those would be added in the future.\n The protector will make your binary nearly impossible to crack or even nearly impossible to investigate whats inside (lets assume that you don't want anyone to see how the communication with your remote backend server is done on the client side, as an example).\n Does anyone would be interested of using such soft? If no please tell why. Are you using any solution that is currently available on the market?

          "description": "Hi, going through the www.learncpp.com tutorial and am just a bit confused about these statements. I am totally new to C++ so I am very likely missing something.\n Firstly, as I understand it, modern inline functions are used for creating functions which, mostly likely by being included as header files, could be redefined again, and this is done to prevent errors (the One Definition Rule). Importantly, all of these definitions must be the same, or else undefined behaviour.,-The%20linker%20will) will result.\n Secondly, inline functions are used in header-only libraries because if they are redefined by the user in their code, there will be no compilation errors to to a violition of the ODR.\n Given all this, the problem seems to be that a user whom #includes a header with a certain function may then define their own function of the same name, which will result in a compilation error by violating ODR.\n What I don't get is that, if instead the header function was inline, the user defining a new function by the same name will probably have a different definition for the function, which will result in undefined behaviour. Surely it is preferable to have a compilation error alerting you to the problem (allowing you to just rename your function) than undefined behaviour at runtime?\n    submitted by    /u/PurpleAmmonia    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

And im not even doing this for a job or anything because if I need to do this as a job I would literally die before doing this.

I don't use a large amount of concepts, but there are a few places where I have needed their functionality. A good example is CRTP base class calling a derrived class' method non-virtually, and only if that method exists -- in essence, implementing Golang's implicit interfaces, non-virtually.\n Since the beginning, I thought that concepts would increase compile-times, since template-related stuff generally does. However, I recently added a decent amount of concepts to an internal graph library. I have not noticed any type of compilation slowdown at all. Again, I don't have a ton of concept usage, but there is a non-trivial amount.

The number of engineers that understand the engine is small. \n My latest client requires an educational rendering framework, its really simple to read and understand, basic features and simplistic caching, and lacks the \"squeeze the last drop of performance out of the code\" design. The number of engineers that can understand the code is high. \n I must confess that I'm enjoying working in the simpler code base more. It lacks complexity, but also has less features and performance. I'm beginning to question whether extra complexity is really worth the hassle. Of course, it all depends on the target project. \n There is a comic that shows the journey from beginner to expert to guru, and the guru code matches the beginer code.\n Any gurus on Reddit willing to share their experience on how they approach new dev projects after doing the beginner->expert->guru journey. Is simpler better? Or since the gurus have the know-how, do I continue pressing pedal to metal to gain a few extra percentage points performance (and make the beast scarier to maintain). \n    submitted by    /u/smallstepforman    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello\n I am trying to understand the way caching and prefetching works by playing around with a raspberry pi 3b.\n I have a piece of code which empties my cache and then traverses an array. To make a long story short, since the traversal of my array is linear (hence spatial locality) and almost nothing else is done besides traversing it (hence temporal locality), unless I get preempted, data should get cached. The fact that I traverse my array linearly implies that it is also very easy to predict what next data will be accessed allowing my CPU's prefetcher to do its job and therefor never experience cache misses. Yet, I still see consistent cache misses at every 64th byte (i.e. 16th index in the case of this experiment).\n Code: https://pastebin.com/raw/Mp85NDEW\n corresponding output: https://pastebin.com/raw/evXmggBf \n You'll see that the access times of 38, 54, 70, 86, 102 are high which is exactly 64 bytes apart every single time.\n I was wondering whether anybody would have some clues about why I am seeing these consistent misses at what corresponds to the end of a cache line?\n EDIT: prefetching is enabled at the hardware level\n    submitted by    /u/blueMarker2910    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Generally speaking such systems are pretty infectious within a codebase so choosing wisely is quite valuable. Reading the docs is useful, but in my opinion not much compares to actually having to live with and work with facilities. In that vein I was hoping to get some insight from people who have used the following libraries as to how they are once deployed; are there unexpected issues or benefits, any regrets; maybe it is rock-solid and doesn't get a second thought? \n  \nAbseil Status\n Boost LEAF\n {Boost,} Outcome\n tl::expected\n std::expected \n  \nWhile there are many differences between the above libraries it seems that perhaps the biggest, in API terms, is whether or not the error type is universal or not. absl::Status has a single error type for all possible errors, whereas the other libraries seem to take a bring-your-own approach. I'm more used to Abseil's approach and was curious about people's experience with writing their own. Do you write many error types and have to convert (perhaps noisily?) between them, do you end up with one big error type that you use most places, etc? Are there any missing from the above list that I should look at?\n    submitted by    /u/beejudd    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "hello, \n i ve tried two kind of implementations: the verlet approach and the force driven approach. (https://www.vobarian.com/collisions/2dcollisions2.pdf)\n the first on is effective but not very interesting from a simulation perspective : it doesn't take collision energy in account.\n The second approach is way better but i can't find a way to handle collisions when the density is too important: this approach doesn't move the particle, it edit the speed vectors. in a sparse world, it works perfectly. When the world is dense ( of particles) the algorithm tends to push a particle inside another one : \n Particle A and B collides, so the algo changes the vector speed of the two particles, then the position is updated using real world physics. but it happens a lot that after this operation , partiicle A or B is now colliding with particle C. In this order it's not a problem because C will be processed afterwards. But if after collision between B and C one particle is inside or colliding with A, ill have exactly the opposite behavior : they are now attached or one is included in another one. \n I suppose this is a standard problem when you want to use real world physics and not just verlet. it had been adressed a lot of times i hope...\n Do you have any ressources on this subject ? i know how to use google.\n    submitted by    /u/Technical_Weight42    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi cpp community,\n I am a dev working on a huge cpp code base and I have never really used constexpr in my daily job as a cpp programmer. I think I understood the basic intent of constexpr and what it tries to tell the compiler in terms of optimization. However I often hesitate using constexpr since I don't really profile the runtime performance of single functions or the compilation times (with or without using it). In addition, I think that it often can't be used if you heavily use concepts like polymorphism and therefore may even extend the compilation time. \n TLDR: I want to use it more to optimize my runtime performance, but miss a clear guidline when it should be used. Due to my concerns regarding compile times, I wouldn't place it everywhere in the code. As a programmer: Maybe a static code analysis tool would be great that notifies me if it might be useful. Do you have similar experience or even advice for me? \n Best wishes! \n    submitted by    /u/RepresentativeAsk492    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

What I would like to do is create a collection of these structs that enforces the uniqueness of each member of each struct. In other words, within this collection, no two structs can have the same value for member A, member B, member C etc. \n Another key detail is that this collection needs to be created at the beginning of the program, but after that will not be modified. Whether this effects what solutions are available to me I'm not sure, but thought it worth mentioning.\n Does anyone have any suggestions for how to achieve this? I've been stumped for a few hours trying to get this sort of behaviour with an unordered set, but I just keep running into issues so I'm stumped. Is std::undordered_set the correct tool for this?

Anyways, having options now to go into web development courses and what not has me wondering how c++ can interact with other language scripts?

This seemingly impossible feat comes with the tradeoff that the set of elements must be known in advance prior to table initialization. In this talk we'll review the basics of perfect hashing theory, explain some of the most common algorithms found in the literature, review some C++ perfect hashing libraries and learn how perfect hashing can be used to improve the efficiency of our programs.\n  \nVideo\n Presentation\n Repo\n  \n   submitted by    /u/joaquintides    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm currently using C++17. Best case would be without third-party libraries but this isn't a strict criterion.\n The current usage is together with a C API like so:\n ``` tests samples{};\n tests::test s{}; my_c_api_function(&s.foo); my_other_c_api_function(&s.bar); samples.add_sample(s); ``` I'm saving the samples in struct of arrays format since thats the format I later need after gathering all samples.\n    submitted by    /u/Arkantos493    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Blend2D 0.11.1 has been released and regardless of the conservative version number the project is progressing and offering more features & optimizations than before.\n Blend2D started in 2015 as an experiment to use a JIT compiler for generating 2D pipelines. It was written for fun with no intention of releasing it. However, because of the excellent results it was indeed released in 2019 under Zlib license and tagged as Beta. The initial version only targeted X86 hardware in its JIT compiler, which was a serious limitation.\n Blend2D's development never stopped and during the years it got new features such as multi-threaded rendering, AVX2 & AVX-512 optimizations, dithered gradients, and even cherries such as SIMD-optimized TrueType font outlines decoding. However, the most important feature, which is AArch64 support, is now part of 0.11.1 release. It means out of box support for AArch64 based SoCs and Apple Silicon.\n Interestingly, the rendering performance is really great on Apple Silicon and in many cases it's even better against competing libraries than on X86 hardware. Results from running a Blend2D benchmarking tool on Apple M3 Pro hardware are available on the Performance page (https://blend2d.com/performance.html) together with AMD Ryzen 9 7950X dataset for comparison. Users can also run their own tests and visualize their results on the Performance page via a \"Custom Dataset\" functionality. The benchmarking tool now outputs JSON after all tests finish.\n Blend2D homepage: https://blend2d.com\n Blend2D fiddle: https://fiddle.blend2d.com\n    submitted by    /u/Asm2D    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

But Intellisense does not notice 99% of errors, and also doesn't give me correct member suggestions when coding.\n So let's say I have a function void processNextSample() {} that takes care of the audio rendering.

          "description": "I'm trying to write an event handler for keyboard input using GLFW. I thought I would create an unordered map with <key, \\*callbackfunction> entries. Each key (an int defined by GLFW_KEY_*) has a corresponding callback function. I would just reference the appropriate key in the map to get the function associated with that key. \n I'm having a lot of trouble getting it up. At first I created the unordered map and tried to just insert callback functions, but because they're member function of class Camera and don't have an associated object yet, and because the functions are non-static, I can't do that. So, I'm trying to use lambda functions to get the map populated. Here is the code that I have so far:\n std::unordered_map<int, std::function<void()>> cameraKeyBindings; void Camera::insertCallbackFunction(int key, void(Camera::*)() function) { cameraKeyBindings.insert(key, [this, function]() {(this->*function)(); }); } void Camera::setcameraKeyBindings() { insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_W, &Camera::linearAccelerationUp); insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_A, &Camera::linearAccelerationLeft); insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_S, &Camera::linearAccelerationDown); insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_D, &Camera::linearAccelerationRight); } \n The main problem right now is that there appears to be something wrong with the syntax:\n void(Camera::*)() \n My compiler gives this error:\n error: expected ‘,’ or ‘...’ before ‘function’\n void insertCallbackFunction(int key, void(Camera::*)() function);\n Unfortunately from what I can find, that seems to be the correct way to declare a member function pointer.

Not really sure.\n The thing is it takes over 3 minutes to recompile, just for one small fix. I’ve seen people saying cpp/hpp implementation/interface structure is more suitable to large C++ software, so I think perhaps I should give it a try.\n But honestly I don’t know where to start. How should one approach this daunting task? I mean, it looks like in each header file, there are always over 10 header files included. So it is really hard to find a place where I can divide some piece of the header file into cpp/hpp to reduce compile time.\n And I wonder if there is some general rules for such a refactorization? \n Sorry for my limited English.

What I’m asking is whether cpp has evolved enough, and whether it might continue to evolve enough, that it could be used as an alternative to languages like rust which come with a lot of safety features at the outset? \n Or is it a bit like a car? Modern cars have airbags and seatbelts and so on.

          "description": "So, I’m fairly new (<6 months) to learning C++, and lately I’ve been interested in test driven development, using Catch2. Catch2 works great, very simple to work with in any .cpp file. Problem is, v2 is a single header, so compilation times are obscene. (I’ve been having trouble installing or utilizing v3 and ended up giving up on the transition; I’m on Linux so this might be an issue of v2 still being around and used silently.)\n I had learned about object files a while back, but mostly just tucked them away into the mental box of “things that exist but I don’t understand when I would need them”. Now, I found a case where I need them!\n From now on, with Catch2 v2, I’m writing unit test files that #include headers with my function declarations, but I compile them to object files without linking. Thus, I’m able to go through the long compile time once per unit test .cpp file (barring future additions to such a file), and then iterate on the function definitions until the test passes, without needing to go through the long compile time whenever I update the function!\n I realize this is a fairly basic thing in anyone’s C++ journey, but it was magical for me in understanding the “why” behind some compiler features.\n    submitted by    /u/DatBoi_BP    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Why does the getter of the parent respect the parent's private attribute first and not that of the child when I access it using a child instance?\n Is there some way to achieve this? I know I can just override the getter in all my child classes, but then what's the point of inheriting the parent class at all?\n Edit: I really should've thought more about the title lol, and should've added some code. \n First, some context. I'm designing a terminal chess application. I have a piece class (kinda abstract) which has private attributes type and color\n There are different subclasses pawn, rook, etc. And their type attribute is initialised appropriately in each.\n Code (typing from mobile, forgive me)\n ```\n class Piece { private: PieceType: type = PieceType::NONE; PieceColor: color;\n public: PieceType getType() { return type; } }\n class Pawn : public Piece { private: PieceType type = PieceType::PAWN; } ```\n And in some other main function Pawn pawn; pawn.getType();\n Now this getType returns NONE, why doesn't it get the type attribute of the child and gets that of the parent?

However, almost every time I use them, it results in multiple definition errors, even when using #pragma once (I also tried inlcude guards, which should be the same thing, but some people advised me to use it instead of #pragma once).\n For example, if I have a header file like this:\n #pragma once int variable; void Function(); \n And I define the functions in a cpp file like this:\n void Function() { //code here } \n When I include this header file in two different cpp files, it results in multiple definition errors.\n However, when I use header files just for classes, like this:\n #pragma once class Class { private: int variable; public: void Function(); } \n And define the class in a cpp file like this:\n void Class::Function() { //code here } \n The compiler does not find any problems.\n Am I using header files incorrectly? What would be the correct way to use them?\n Alternatively, I've been increasingly using extern variables and forward declarations. It usually works very well without the need for header files or #include.\n Is it bad practice to rely on the use of extern and forward declarations? Should I use more function pointers and lambdas?

However, when I added qcustomplot.h and qcustomplot.cpp files into the same working directory and modified CMake file like that:\n cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10) project(FunctionPlotter) set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20) set(CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON) # added set(CMAKE_AUTOUIC ON) # added set(CMAKE_AUTORCC ON) # added find_package(Qt5Widgets REQUIRED) find_package(Qt5Core REQUIRED) find_package(Qt5Gui REQUIRED) find_package(Qt5PrintSupport REQUIRED) add_executable(FunctionPlotter main.cpp CHFinding_app_window.cpp) add_library(QCustomPlot qcustomplot.cpp qcustomplot.h) # added target_link_libraries(FunctionPlotter QCustomPlot Qt5::Widgets Qt5::Core Qt5::Gui Qt5::PrintSupport) # QCustomPlot added target_include_directories(FunctionPlotter PRIVATE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}) # added \n I started getting an error saying: QtCore/qglobal.h - no such file or directory (relating to this line of code: #include <QtCore/qglobal.h>). This is even weirded considering that adding that line to main.cpp caused no issues at all.\n Does anyone know what could this issue stem from?

If not, at least I got to help someone realize it's never too late to try and make your dreams come true. SO...\n TLDR:\n Where is the best place to start? I have tried grasshopper, enjoyed it but got only about 45 exercises in until someone basically said it wasn't going to help. Suggestions? Advice? TYSM in advance :)\n    submitted by    /u/Charming-Mix5057    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

You’ll find that the C++ language specification leaves everything wide open; it doesn’t define packages in any way. Headers just show up somehow, and the language spec doesn’t care how. As a result, every possible way of installing and finding headers and libraries is already in use, and a package manager would have to accommodate all of them. Good luck with that nonsense. Oh, and don’t forget that C++20 modules make the problem even worse.\"\n Since the OP was in r/rust (I am not the OP), I wanted to hear what cpp people thought on this, both whether rust's actual package management system could be transplanted to cpp and/or whether modules remedy the problems some/many people have with cpp in terms of headers or whether they have just made things worse.\n    submitted by    /u/anonymous_bear_6    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Lately I'm getting into the habit of using std::getline to get a string filled (from whatever stream) and then pass it to a std::ispanstream object and then do the actual extraction operation on the ispanstream object (often using operator>> or sometimes getline).\n So it's a two step input operation. It's more code to write obviously. It's good in terms of separation of concerns though. First get the raw string from the initial stream object (e.g. std::cin) and then do the actual extraction and validation operations on the temporary ispanstream object.\n But my question is that is this approach overkill for getting input from the user? And is it bad in terms of performance (how fast is ispanstream)?\n I know that many just don't use std::istringstream since it's got some noticable overhead. But ispanstream shouldn't have much overhead though, right?\n I'm here for opinions from everyone.\n    submitted by    /u/better_life_please    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

All it does is remove the include lines one by one and if the source file still compiles after removing a line the we give error that include not needed.

To fix we had to add back some include lines.\n But just wondering if this is some problem with language in that it is not totally backwards compatible in that you may have to change source to get it to compile with later version of gcc.\n    submitted by    /u/Nearing_retirement    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Been working with PHP for a pretty long period of time. Let’s start with the task I am working on and what problem I have got and want to tackle in the best way possible.\n Recently, I have reminded myself a project I have been working in university - Trains Schedule. Main functions had to be: - Show trains schedule - Search among various filters - CRUD\n So I have decided to rework on that using Raylib with a GUI instead of console. Wanted to fancy fonts, SFX and stuff.\n Problem came from place where I didn’t though of - Config class. Because config file contains fonts settings, sfx settings, misc, etc.\n How do I properly do a Config class to be able to be used among various classes without a need of re-reading a config file?\n Would really appreciate some constructive feedback on this matter.\n Regards.\n    submitted by    /u/Romanovich0195    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Its time to put my heart and soul in these two weeks to study but im so stuck on how to do the question if im clueless of whats supposed to be in the syntax.

I know I'll need to use classes for this. While the function itself isn't too difficult, understanding where it belongs, what inputs it needs, what it should output, and how it all fits together is the challenging part.\n I'm not an expert in programming; I'm more of a beginner. I know basic concepts like loops and data types, and I understand the idea of pointers, classes etc.. My main problem is applying these concepts correctly in different situations and internalizing them.\n I've been using learncpp.com, which I like, but it seems too time-intensive. Maybe I'm approaching it the wrong way? I read, make notes, and then try the examples. This takes a lot of time. I am on part three \"Debugging\" part. \n I then switched to studyplan.dev, which offers shorter lessons. However, it sometimes feels too superficial and lacks practical exercises. Here, I also completed Chapter 3 about classes. \n I recently discovered Codecademy's free C++ course. Would you recommend it, or do you have other suggestions? Or should I stick with learncpp and force myself to learn it this way?\n I also saw that there are some YouTube videos, and I like the concept of watching people explain things. However, I'm not sure if there are very good series on C++.\n I would appreciate any advice you can offer.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/chiefbroson    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I'm am looking for information on the way you handle your project's build targets, the best practices, what worked the best for you and your teams.\n Specifically, other than debug and release targets, do you maintain other build configuration when releasing software ? Personally, I rarely only maintain those 2 targets: I have at least a RETAIL/FINAL build, and sometimes, a test build. More than 4 targets is a pain to deal with, so I never go there. Here's the differences between them, the features they have:\n Debug build: should be for development only, not for testing. Debug version will include debug info, and no optimization;\n Release build, more specifically 'development release': does contain liited debug information (generated program database files, pdbs) but also has some degree of optimizations. The rationale of this build is that the debug build often is too big, bulky and slow to be practical when testing or reproducing a bug.\n Final/Retail : here the build has zero debug information, full optimization and for example, in visual studio, WholeProgramOptimization and link-time code generation to perform whole-program optimization. Leveraging optimizing compilers : OCs take the code that you have written and re-write parts of it in order to minimize the memory footprint, maximize execution speed, or both. Making it very hard to debug.\n Sometime, a QA build is maintained because our QA have specific needs in regards with what they need to test the software.\n What are you guys thoughts oon this ? If you also maintain a 'production' build in addition to the release buid, how to did you name it ? retail ? final ?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/zolaternative    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

In other words, padding is not allowed before the first data member of a standard-layout type. Note that strict aliasing rules still apply to the result of such cast.\n  \nIs this relevant to the above? I.e. does dereferencing int_through_a violate strict aliasing because a given standard layout type is not generally similar to its first member? https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion#Similar_types ; https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reinterpret_cast#Type_accessibility ; or is it fine because we know there is an object of type int at this address even though the pointer is obtained from a reinterpret_cast? \n Secondly, is it correct that skipping the line (i.e. initializing int_through_b) is UB?\n    submitted by    /u/KuntaStillSingle    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can find SCPs in crew scheduling or test selection, for example.\n Currently, commercial MILP solvers like Cplex or Gurobi are often the go-to option for SCPs. But, while they are powerful, well-designed heuristics can often achieve even better results (especially when the available time is tight).\n Our implementation is based on the work of Caprara, Fischetti, and Toth. It was originally developed for a research project, but we've decided to clean it up and make it publicly available as a free, high-performing alternative.\n We also hope the library serves as a helpful companion to the original paper, which can get a bit technical at times.\n Since this is our first real open-source contribution, any constructive feedback is welcomed. We hope this library will prove helpful.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/__c4v4    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everybody.\n I've tried searching for a term that may answer this question but couldn't find such example.\n here's what I hope is a brief explanation:\n I have a variable that is used (via reference) across different threads, but it's not accessed concurrently due to the flow of execution, if the variable itself is not guarded with a mutex or some atomic mechanism, is one of the threads allowed to assume it has the latest value, and \"skip a read\" on the next access?\n thread1 and thread2 holds a reference to an int.\n thread1 is requested to print the int to console (so we assume it goes to memory and read it).\n thread2 increments the int.\n thread1 is requested to print the int once again to console, while still holding the same reference as it did earlier.\n My question is, can thread1 assume the value was never changed, and use the older value instead of reading from memory again? or can it hold some cache about this variable and read from it's cache and not see the update thread2 did?\n I may be overthinking it, but I want to use an atomic_int and justify my decision rather than going blindly over the safer decision. an atomic_int, I believe guarantees it will go ahead and read the latest value, is that about right?\n if there's a specific topic in memory access/thread safety that speaks about this kind of situation I'd be happy to learn more.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Echo_1Q    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

The code boils down to\n double e = 12; double d = 0.024; int j = 44; double start = e + j * d; \n When I do that arithmetic on the x86 machine in the debugger I get\n 13.056000000000001 \n And that's the value when I print out or read the memory of the start variable.\n I get the same number when I do that arithmetic in the debugger on the Mac, but when the start variable actually gets assigned the value ends up being\n 13.055999999999999 \n It's a tiny difference but obviously it compounds with every further calculation (especially later when std::floor gets called when one machine has something like 10.99...9 and the other has something like 11.00...1). I get the concept of floating point precision errors in calculations, but can there be precision errors when assigning a variable? Does this difference seem like it's from the compiler or the hardware itself? Or maybe I'm missing something.\n I have to explain to a group of scientists why they're getting such different results on different machines, and as far as I can tell this is where the numerical differences start.

Or should I start with something easier like Python?\n My thinking goes like this: If I where to learn Python, I would have to sit with it every day after work hours and learn, but If I learn C++ - I can learn a little bit in my spare time, but still interact with it every day and learn some things from my job.\n My goal is not to become a developer, but to work within cyber security.

          "description": "So I get the whole paradigm about having a completely valid, initialized object as soon as it comes into being via the \"resource acquisition\".\n However, it seems to me that this is the much less important part of RAII. The more imporant part being: objects out of scope release their resources automatically. \n The destructor releasing the resources (e.g. a lock_guard releasing a mutex) is much harder to get right because releasing it manually would have to occur at the end of the scope. Conversely, if we weren't allowed to use a constructor, it wouldnt be as hard to manage, because the initialization would usually follow closely after the resource allocation. \n Consider the following example: \n int fun() { SomeBigObject* o = new SomeBigObject(); // assume empty constructor // 1. Initialize o->name = \"someName\"; o->number = 42; // ... // 2. Stuff happens, maybe early return, maybe exception delete o; // 3. Missing this is much more consequential! } \n Now lets assume SomeBigObject does have a more useful constructor, with the initalizations I made to be done there, but no destructor. Taken literally, you would have \"acquired the resources\" and \"initialized them\" with only a constructor - even though this is not what is generally understood by RAII, which usually entails the destructor that does the cleanup when something goes out of scope.\n ​\n  \nAm I missing something or is there another good reason that I'm missing?\n Why couldnt the committee think of a better name? It confused me a lot in the beginning. I think something like \"Ownership & Valid intialization as a class invariant\" or something.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Gay-B0wser    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are still on C++17 at my firm and while I have learned some things during my time at this company, my company is in an industry where low latency programming is really important, and when I interviewed for other companies in the industry, they made it abundantly clear that expertise of C++20 and above is crucial for the industry.\n I would like to get more modern C++ programming experience while I stay in this role so that I have some job mobility in case my future in this company goes awry. For those of you in jobs where the tech is behind, how do you manage to keep up? I’ve started reading some books on modern C++ programming and I’ve been trying to find open source projects to work on, but I haven’t really found many projects online that make use of a lot of the modern C++20 syntax (e.g. concepts, ranges, even older stuff like CRTP).

This is all because the \"#include 'customlib.h'\" back at the main.cpp file is not wrapped with the Cuslib namespace, when you add it the whole code compiles as normal. Does anyone have any idea on why that happens?\n Edit: code formatted\n    submitted by    /u/jenkem_boofer    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm struggling with structuring a project in C++. Writing everything in a single file becomes difficult to maintain.\n I've tried splitting systems into different CPP files, but I often need the same function or variable in multiple files. When I use header files, I encounter multiple declaration errors, even with #pragma once. I also attempted to use the MVC pattern, but I faced similar issues. I can't seem to create a generic loop in the main file that can pass and receive data from the MVC modules without including the same header in different files, which again leads to multiple declaration errors.

I get that using the regular future would throw the exception that the future is invalid if multiple threads try to access it’s result, but as I’m still a beginner, I just don’t have a good program example of where someone would use it. Can any experienced programmers tell me a bit about where you might implement std::shared_future in your program? Like why you would use it? especially since cppreference says that access to the same shared state from multiple threads is safe if each thread does it “through its own copy” of a shared_future object (keyword copy sounds like something a program shouldn’t do)\n    submitted by    /u/topman20000    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you don't know how thermocouples work, essentially it's a simple device of 2 wires being welded together, and at specific temperatures they output a known voltage. \n This is commonly used for temperature measurement, as you can measure the voltage to get temperature (simplified). In order to know the temperature based off of the voltage you must have the table that corresponds the voltage and temperature. Since this table is just temperature to voltage, its 2 columns. However the tables sometimes have 1500+ rows.To add to the pain, I haven't been able to find a text file of these tables, only PDF formats. \n What would be the fastest way to implement these tables into memory and search through one column of data to find the corresponding data point.

          "description": "I am self teaching myself C++ from learncpp.com. I am on chapter 2 which is where it goes over functions and their different types.\n Once thing i've notices is that it keeps going over the same code it went over before and modifying it to find out different ways you can go about writing the code.\n For example: Void and Int functions.\n I'm quite familiar with int functions but quite confused on void because it doesn't explain what it is very well. In section 2.4 it goes off imediatley showing a code I practised alot and understand how it works but then soon shows how we can make it work with the void function.\n The code (Int):\n include <iostream>\n int getValueFromUser() { std::cout << \"Enter an integer\"; int input; std::cin >> input; return input; }\n int main() { int num{ getValueFromUser() }; std::cout << num << \" Doubled is: \" << num * 2 << '\\n'; return 0;\n  \nPretty straightforward right? You're making the code prompt you to enter an integer and then it will double the the number.\n Example:\n 4 Doubled is: 8\n But then the tutorial brought that one back again and decided to make it work with the void function.\n include <iostream>\n int getValueFromUser() { std::cout << \"Enter an integer\"; int input; std::cin >> input; return input; }\n void printDouble(int value) { std::cout << value << \" Doubled is: \" << value * 2 << '\\n' }\n int main() { int num { getValueFromUser() }; printDouble(num); return 0; }\n  \nMy biggest annoyance here is why are you trying to make me do 50 extra steps to a code I already got good at, no wonder i'm confused on how your explaining things.\n Any better tutorial so I don't have to deal with this?\n    submitted by    /u/Ko938AUp    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am trying to follow the one from the Head First Design Pattern books where it only has the function hasNext() and Next(). On paper it seems straightforward but I am trying to pinpoint if my problem is with the understanding of what exactly is a map iterator and what exactly I am passing. With regards to my uni textbook, it does not cover maps.\n To my understanding, a map is composed of a pair struct where first is the key and the other is the value. In order to go through the whole map I need the iterator for the first element and the last element and I can get those via map.begin() and map.end() and an iterator can be progressed via the ++ operator. I am trying to protect my map by encapsulating it in a class thus an iterator class is the only way for me to go through the map. Now I am confused as to what exactly I should be passing when I am iterating and how I can control access of the iterator so as not to expose my map.\n    submitted by    /u/towerbooks3192    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I would like to initiate a discussion about a software architecture case I am currently facing at the company I work for, and get your opinions on how I can improve the application's architecture.\n I built an application in Java 17, using Spring Boot 2.7, about 6 months ago. This application handles approximately 20k RPM, with an average response time of 60-80ms. As the initiative for which this application was proposed started generating a lot of money, the product team decided that this same functionality should be available in other parts of the main sales site. This change will cause the application to receive around 500k RPM in the coming months.\n This application does not involve any heavy processing; it only makes API calls to fetch delivery information and returns it. A significant part of the response time is due to waiting for other applications. With this increase in traffic, I am exploring how to improve its performance to avoid issues and reduce response time. We have a load balancer and instance scaling system that will manage the platform.\n I plan to upgrade the application to use Spring 3.2 and Java 21, so I can use Java's virtual threads to improve throughput, as we have some parallel calls.\n One of my colleagues suggested that we change the application from Java to Go, but I believe that in this case, we would not have significant gains, except for faster scaling. I think this because the application's workflow mainly involves waiting for responses from other APIs. What do you think about this? Would it be worth switching this application to Go? What gains would we have?\n Instance resources are not a problem because we use the smallest machine available on our platform, and even so, it has plenty of resources left over\n    submitted by    /u/SemFutur0  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In regards to the new 'iterators' coming in Go 1.23, I stumbled upon some blog posts and chatter on social media talking about how this is an unnecessary language change. I was somewhat aware of the proposal and thought the func(func(T)bool) bool was a bit odd but after seeing this, I started investigating further and contributing to the discussion on https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61897\n I've always thought channels are the obvious choice for representing iterators (as they represent a stream, queue or sequence of values), naturally I assumed there must be a good reason why the language had to change the spec in order to support iterators (instead of adding compiler optimisations for channels to support this, I've even gone into some detail on how this could be implemented efficiently).\n The reaction I've received, however, is bizarre? I've been told it's too late to comment on this, it's already been decided. That channels must not be used for this (technically they can be used as iterators). Instead Go is adding special case functions to the language spec and a special case package iter just to support the same language semantics as receive-only channels?\n I've always considered Go (and the community) to be very cautious about making languages changes, not to add duplicate ways of representing the same thing. Pushing a cohesive and simple design. I'm curious, is it just me feeling like there is a major shift in principles here and is there anybody else who has had a look at this and thought the built-in channels are the obvious answer here?\n    submitted by    /u/Splizard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We are a relatively new Go team and are still finding our path in it. These days, I can't provide good reasoning to my team for why we should use the OO approach(the approach example in the link) or just use plain functions without receivers.\n I see a lot of Go code using an OO approach, especially creation patterns like the Factory pattern, Builder pattern, and Singletons. There's a lot of encapsulation tied to structs and interfaces with methods in them. I understand that Go is not a fully OO language and uses a mixture of OO, functional, and imperative programming.\n But we seem very confused about which approach is the best. My vision is the following:\n  \nUsing certain OO creational patterns in packages.\n Using receivers in package functions where it makes sense and the rest is imperative.\n  \nCan the Go community tell me what is the golden middle?\n My manager wrote a package that contains just functions. My suggestion was that we should use the Factory pattern with a NewSomething() function that returns a struct. He reasonably questioned me, \"Why is your suggestion better than what I did?\"\n Various AIs provided multiple good reasons and all supported the suggestion I gave. What do you experts think?\n EDIT: here is another example of what I am talking about https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/bufio/bufio.go\n    submitted by    /u/No_Equipment9108  \n [link]   [comments]",

After finding the command, even typing that becomes annoying since you have to type two commands most times (one for getting the id or name of the object, which I do most times, and the other for the actual command). I felt this whole thing could be streamlined. \n Sure, GUI docker management tools exist but I did not want to open a browser that takes half my RAM (electron duh..) and then use my mouse to point and click buttons for a task like this.\n Enter goManageDocker, a simple TUI tool that lets you manage your docker objects with a single keystroke (seriously), it has vim keybinds for easy navigation and you can do any action with a single keystroke! All of these for a few megabytes of RAM too!!\n If this does pique your interest, you can find the repo here!.\n I'm open to any feedback as well. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Krunchy_Almond  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't understand how the Java code differs from the Go code in satisfying this criterion of static interface/flexible implementation. They both look the same to me. In both cases the client defines an interface and the publisher (logic provider) implements some logic object conforming to that interface. In both cases, the main() function constructs a client object using the logic object and calls the `process' function defined by the logic object. What am I missing here?\n Java code:\n public interface Logic { String process(String data); } public class LogicImpl implements Logic { public String process(String data) { // business logic } } public class Client { private final Logic logic; // this type is the interface, not the implementation public Client(Logic logic) { this.logic = logic; } public void program() { // get data from somewhere this.logic.process(data); } } public static void main(String[] args) { Logic logic = new LogicImpl(); Client client = new Client(logic); client.program(); } \n Here's the Go implementation\n type LogicProvider struct {} func (lp LogicProvider) Process(data string) string { // business logic } type Logic interface { Process(data string) string } type Client struct{ L Logic } func(c Client) Program() { // get data from somewhere c.L.Process(data) } main() { c := Client{ L: LogicProvider{}, } c.Program() \n }\n    submitted by    /u/pakraaaw  \n [link]   [comments]",

These interface definitions are not stable since they are broken every time a service adds a new operation.\n Usage of *iface should be replaced by scoped caller-defined interfaces for the service operations being used:\n // V1 import \"io\" import \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3\" import \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3/s3iface\" func GetObjectBytes(client s3iface.S3API, bucket, key string) ([]byte, error) { object, err := client.GetObject(&s3.GetObjectInput{ Bucket: &bucket, Key: &key, }) if err != nil { return nil, err } defer object.Body.Close() return io.ReadAll(object.Body) } // V2 import \"context\" import \"io\" import \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3\" type GetObjectAPIClient interface { GetObject(context.Context, *s3.GetObjectInput, ...func(*s3.Options)) (*s3.GetObjectOutput, error) } func GetObjectBytes(ctx context.Context, client GetObjectAPIClient, bucket, key string) ([]byte, error) { object, err := api.GetObject(ctx, &s3.GetObjectInput{ Bucket: &bucket, Key: &key, }) if err != nil { return nil, err } defer object.Body.Close() return io.ReadAll(object.Body) } \n My Thoughts\n I understand why AWS does not want to maintain a separate interface package in v2. Their reasoning is that they break whenever something is added. However, I thought the interfaces were very simple and convenient to use.\n I also know that Go prescribes defining interfaces where you actually consume, however, the AWS methods are always very verbose and when I copy the methods that I use I have to remove the named parameters when converting.

They are loosely following hexagonal architecture. On the JVM, I would creat multiple modules that then have their package structure like app-a/domain, app-a/adapters, app-b/domain etc where app-a is the module.\n Currently, I have something close to this:  ❯ tree . ├── db │ ├── migration │ │ └── 000.sql │ ├── sqlite.go │ └── store.go ├── discord │ ├── client.go │ └── message.go ├── domain │ ├── filter\\_test.go │ ├── filters.go │ ├── import\\_matches.go │ ├── match.go │ └── store.go  where db, discord and domain are separate packages.

I had experience using echo, so this was the one I chose.\n These types needed to be inferred, they would not be explicitly given in any way. You are not allowed to use any api generation tools like swagger or blueprint.\n Overall, I was unable to complete the challenge the way they wanted, I wrote a solution where the user needed to pass req and resp types when registering a handler.\n Looking at it now, this is as far I as can get. I'm assuming you would need to call the function and and use reflection on the response to know its type, but im still really uncertain as to how to properly call this handler function without knowing the request type.\n https://go.dev/play/p/OH5V1cR43FZ\n I'm at my wits' end, so any help would be greatly appreciated.\n edit:\n After long discussions with helpful people in this forum, its clear this coding challenge was disingenuous. A solution would rely on this theoretical api server's documentation strategies. E.g. one could expect to pull this information from struct tags (if the server was implemented in go).\n This wasn't a coding challenge, this was the company looking for a solution to a problem they had, and got free labor in the process.

I don't remember seeing it in the books I read so far (I read the 100 common mistakes and the Effective Go books).\n I inherited some application and had many problems with properly shutting things down. There was always something that 'stuck' or lived after it shouldn't have... After going a few circles I introduced a rule that is summarized as\n  \nfunctions should be synchronous\n if they need to start multiple goroutines to do stuff in parallel, they are free to do that\n but they need to wait until those routines terminate.\n  \nI also introduced contexts where the previous guy was a bit lazy, and this thing emerged as a pattern. I can be sure that things are properly shut down when the function returns to the caller. There are no more 'ghost effects' from go routines of the 'past'.\n Since I started doing this my thinking about handling gorutines completely changed, and I often spot the lack of it in others' code, then immediately see that they don't have the same guarantees about ghosts and termination that I have.\n Sometimes this is a bit hard to do, for example when dealing with Reader.Read() in a goroutine. Because Read() doesn't have context and can block for unbounded time. But I always have this ichy feeling that this is somehow bad and figure out a way to make the function behave well (to my standards). I tend to follow it especially within our codebase.\n We do mostly backend stuff, my experience with go is limited to that subject.\n I call this 'leave no goroutine behind', but it might have a name already.

          "description": "I'm using Mongo in production and working on how to handle migrations. My database still has a schema; the schema is just shifted from SQL table definitions over into the code itself. If I change the format of a struct representing the document in a collection or add a relational field to another collection, previous records in the DB need to be updated to reflect this, or I end up with bad data.\n Right now I'm handling this with a function for each migration step. Each migration has an ID associated to it and I keep a migrations collection with the timestamp when this migration was run (if it was run). This way I don't have to rerun any previous steps. I'm trying to make each one idempotent, so even without the migration collection, they could potentially run again if needed. The \"migrations\" collection is just for performance purposes, to avoid having to run all historic migrations every time the app starts.\n I've been reading about the various SQL DB migration tools, and declarative state based migrations vs functional time-series migrations. The latter sounds roughly like what I'm doing. I'm mostly just trying to understand if what I'm doing is common or if there's some better way that I hadn't considered (and why?)\n How are you dealing with this?\n    submitted by    /u/RomanaOswin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Implementing this trait is unsafe but straight-forward, and once implemented everything else is safely enforced using the type system.\n Notable features:\n  \nFully replicates the std::any module\n Near-identical API for 'static types with small changes for transient types\n Supports any number of generic type/lifetime/const parameters\n No external dependencies without feature-gates\n Includes a (feature-gated) derive macro for the Transient trait\n ProvidesTransient impls for many stdlib types\n Provides (feature-gated) Transient impls for some foreign types - feel free to request more!\n Extensive documentation including numerous examples\n Permissive MIT/APACHE-2.0 dual license\n  \nI decided to make this crate after running into the 'static-only limitation of the stdlib version on multiple occasions, such as when I wanted to erase the type of an ndarray::ArrayView<'v, T, D> to pass it through generic-forbidding code and ended up having to clone the data instead. If you have ever faced a situation like this (which I'll admit is fairly niche), then this is the crate for you!\n Let me know what you think!

My understanding of how they work is that shaders run on the gpu, that output is used somehow to create ✨graphics✨; and I know that opengl, vulkan, etc can help with that.

It is suitable for general purpose graphics and compute on the GPU.\n Applications using wgpu run natively on Vulkan, Metal, DirectX 12, and OpenGL ES; and browsers via WebAssembly on WebGPU and WebGL2.\n  \nbut this (the description from wgpu homepage) is tripping me up. if wgpu serves the same purpose as opengl and vulkan, what does it mean for it to \"run\" on one of those? based on that description, presumably wgpu is more generic than opengl or vulkan, but if so, what can it actually do? and if one is trying to make an application that has graphics, would one only need wgpu? or would they need other stuff?\n furthermore, what do these libraries provide beyond just shaders? do they somehow make it easier to use them? if graphics are on the gpu, then why is there a non-shader interface at all? what does that provide?\n    submitted by    /u/Critical_Ad_8455  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since then, RMK envolves a loooooooooot. Now I'd happy to annouce that RMK hits v0.2.0, with a bunch of exciting new features.\n The following is a simple list of important updates from v0.1.0.\n  \nWireless support for nRF52 and esp32. RMK now supports BLE/USB dual mode with auto-switch feature\n A new configuration system based on toml. Now you can config almost everything of your keyboard with a single keyboard.toml, no Rust code is required! This makes RMK more user-friendly. If you want do more customization, you can still\n A new rapid debouncer, which would trigger the key first and then do debouncing\n Interrupt triggered matrix scanning, which reduces power consumption a lot\n Support more advanced keyboard feature: mouse key, media key and tap/hold feature\n Documentation and project-template got improved a lot\n  \nI also did some measurement about the performance and power consumption of RMK firmware. According to my testing on my nRF52840 GH60 board(open-sourced as rmk-ble-keyboard), the key latency of RMK is about 2 ms in wired mode and 10 ms in wireless(BLE) mode. The power consumption is about 200ua when advertising, 450ua when idling and 2ma when typing, which means RMK could provide about 2-3 months battery life with a 2000mah battery.\n In the duration of implementing RMK, I got lots of help from Rust community. The Rust community is so great. Also, the great tooling provided by Rust makes the dev experience quite pleasurable. Finally, I'm looking forward to more feedbacks about the project.

          "description": "Stronger question, why aren't any of the PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd and Ord traits (I would call them PEPO) unsafe?\n From the Rust Nomicon:\n  \nOn trait declarations, unsafe means that implementors of the trait must check the trait documentation to ensure their implementation maintains the contracts the trait requires.\n  \nThe PEPO traits have requirements which have to be upheld by implementors. Thus it would be natural for them to be unsafe, this is even suggested in the same chapter of the Nomicon. When the traits aren't marked as unsafe but have requirements unsafe code must assume the trait contracts don't always hold. I can also easily imagine a safe function implicitly relying on the reflexivity of Eq for example and thus behaving differently than it should, breaking it's own safe invariants.\n The reason behind not marking PEPO traits as unsafe is explained in the same chapter of the Nomicon:\n  \nThe decision of whether to mark a trait unsafe is an API design choice. A safe trait is easier to implement, but any unsafe code that relies on it must defend against incorrect behavior. Marking a trait unsafe shifts this responsibility to the implementor. Rust has traditionally avoided marking traits unsafe because it makes Unsafe Rust pervasive, which isn't desirable.\n  \nThis confuses me. How would marking the PEPO traits as unsafe make them harder to implement, when the trait contracts would be exactly the same and also, don't the benefits of marking the PEPO traits as unsafe outweigh the drawbacks?

The borrow checker forces me to understand the memory well which gives me a lot more confidence when mutating something (in Java, you don't own the object, and you don't know if some other part of the program holds a reference to it, so you're not very sure what part of the program would be affected by the mutation)\n However it seems to me that all the things that I love are the high level part of the language and the inspiration it took from functional programming.\n Sure I appreciate the language is very fast and that the same language can be used on bare metal, but it is not very useful to me, it never was a grievance to Java for me after all. The borrow checker can sometimes be annoying and although a high level language, it sometimes forces me to have low level considerations.\n The low level part although useful and interesting, is not very relevant to me, and I wonder what I could trade against this part of the language. In other words what could a high level only Rust look like? Could you make any suggestions of languages that can fit this description? I am thinking something with no nulls or exceptions, statically typed, with some emphasis on function purity, with algebraic data types and reasonably fast (something competitive to Java)\n I am thinking something like gleam, haskell or elm maybe but I would like to hear your thoughts and if you would take the trade-off.\n Thank you for reading me\n    submitted by    /u/Locarito  \n [link]   [comments]",

The main purpose of this crate is to allow you to defer handling individual Result::Errs and to group and nest arbitrary error types ergonomically, enabling you to return multiple error values from functions at the same time. Here's a link: https://crates.io/crates/lazy_errors\n I started learning Rust five years ago in my spare time. There is so much I love about the community and the ecosystem: The language is both nice to read and write, very expressive, and the community has documented extensively how to design good, idiomatic solutions. There are a lot of powerful crates that just feel natural. For example, thiserror and anyhow/eyre are just so fundamental to defining or handling errors …",

          "description": "Dear fellow Rustaceans,\n Arguably the most challenging part of being a programmer is internalizing a lot of details, sometimes implicit, about the codebase you're working with. It takes significant time, even for an experienced developer, to become fully autonomous on a new project.\n I've always wanted to find a way to ease this process of memorizing the codebase, and I have also been fascinated with large language models since first learning about them. As you already guessed, my pet project is a thing that utilizes the LLMs' language understanding to answer questions about the repo you are in. As seen on the screenshot, it first scans through the code with Tree Sitter to map out the interrelations among the symbols, after that it reads through the selected source files to understand them, and then it presents its conclusion to the user.\n The key point here is that by staying in the command-line interface you do not break context. You do not have to copy-paste anything anywhere, and the conversation just flows.\n Other good questions it may help you with:\n  \nDuring what period of time were we using a vulnerable version of a certain crate?\n Who are the top three committers?\n Is there a user-wide config?\n  \nI very much hope someone might find this helpful as well. Any feedback is welcome, both on the code, and on the looks and feels of it:\n https://github.com/xhjkl/well\n $ cargo install well\n screenshot of well in action\n    submitted by    /u/makarmakar  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are excited to announce pgml, our official Rust SDK for PostgresML, and the rust_bridge, the crate we the crate we utilize to generate our JavaScript, Python, and now C SDKs from our Rust SDK.\n We have had the SDK available on GitHub for a while now, but this marks its official release on crates.io. \n Maybe more interesting for some of the community is the rust_bridge crate (docs still in progress). The rust_bridge exposes a series of macros and traits that can be implemented to translate vanilla Rust into py03, neon, and C compatible Rust. For those interested we have a writeup on How We Generate JavaScript and Python SDKs From Our Canonical Rust SDK. We recently added C into the rust_bridge and are working on interop with additional runtimes, like Go, JVM, and Beam.\n We wanted to thank the community for all the effort that gets put into OpenSource Rust and are hoping that our contributions will be helpful!\n Let us know if you have any questions, stay awesome. \n    submitted by    /u/smarvin2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As you should know, getting a reference (shared or exclusive) to a \"static mut\" will probably end up as a compile time error in 2024 edition.\n Like a lot of people, I use \"static mut\" for global state. I never really thought about why \"static mut\" is whacky.\n  \nIf my program is single thread, why do I need to synchronize the access of a \"static mut\" ? After all, no race condition can happen.\n \nWhy Rust force me to use \"unsafe\" to touch this \"static mut\" ?\n \n The reason is aliasing : if you use \"static mut\" in a way that end up with more than 1 exclusive reference, this is undefined behavior.\n The compiler assume only 1 exclusive reference to a memory location can exist at any point in time. \"static mut\" give you the power to get as many exclusive reference you want (by using \"unsafe\").\n Even if you think you can manage this, this can be very surprising and result in ugly code.\n 1st, you'll have to use \"unsafe\" at any time you touch the \"static mut\".\n 2nd, if you store an exclusive reference of the \"static mut\" on the stack (temporary or function argument), you can't have another one unless the first one lifetime end.\n 3rd, you'll have to shorten the lifetime yourself by using block {} or function call.\n 4th, even using a shared reference forbid you to have an exclusive reference somewhere.\n It's very easy to forgot you have already one reference of the \"static mut\" in-use inside your call-stack (upper), and the compiler doesn't say anything because all access of the \"static mut\" are gate behind \"unsafe\". The same problem happen in multi-thread with Mutex : if you have one lock in your call-stack, and you try to lock the same Mutex again, it's probably a deadlock. One could consider it's a programmer error and you should respect the invariant, I don't know what to say about that.\n What are your favorite alternative ? OnceCell, OnceLock. UnsafeCell, SyncUnsafeCell, RefCell, Arc<Mutex>, Rc<RefCell>, std::ptr::addr_of_mut! ?\n    submitted by    /u/Nzkx  \n [link]   [comments]",

This app would need some SQL stuff, not too much desktop integration.\n The main reason to no develop a simple web It's avoid using servers.\n Right now I'm good with typescript and react. Also python but I think it won't be useful for that.\n I don't know rust, but I don't mind to learn.\n \n My first thought was about electron, some apps I use are made with electron, it's widely used and fits my language knowledge, but, maybe it's a bit bloat, some of the apps I use are slow even for \"simple\" purposes. Also bundle size could be close to 200M for a simple text editor. Apps like VSCode are very optimized despite that, but I'm not Microsoft,\n So I saw Tauri, It looks great, even made my first \"hello world\" app in twenty minutes, but I cannot find serious projects using this technology. Most of the stuff I found are simple hobby projects abandoned a couple of years ago.

After finishing rustaceans I decided to try implementing a binary tree.\n I struggled a lot trying to get the borrows right, and compiler screamed a lot at me especially when I tried to hold multiple mutable references (forgot they are exclusive).

I think a lot of that came from trying not to drop or move a Box, hence the `ref mut`s. Could you mind giving me some guidance? What can i do to make this more idiomatic?\n #[derive(Debug)] pub struct Node<T> { pub value: T, pub left: Option<Box<Node<T>>>, pub right: Option<Box<Node<T>>>, } impl<T> Node<T> { fn new(value: T) -> Self { Node{value: value, left: None, right: None} } } #[derive(Debug)] pub struct BinaryTree<T> where T: PartialOrd { pub root: Option<Box<Node<T>>> } impl<T: PartialOrd> BinaryTree<T> { fn new() -> Self { BinaryTree { root: Option::None } } fn is_empty(&self) -> bool { return self.root.is_none(); } fn insert(&mut self, value: T) { if let Some(ref mut node) = self.root { let mut node = node.as_mut(); loop { if value < node.value { if let Some(ref mut child) = node.left { node = child.as_mut(); } else { let new_node = Box::new(Node::new(value)); node.left = Some(new_node); break; } } else if value > node.value { if let Some(ref mut child) = node.right { node = child.as_mut(); } else { let new_node = Box::new(Node::new(value)); node.right = Some(new_node); break; } } else { break; } } } else { let new_node = Box::new(Node::new(value)); self.root = Some(new_node); } } } fn main() { let mut my_tree = BinaryTree::<i32>::new(); my_tree.insert(5); my_tree.insert(7); my_tree.insert(3); my_tree.insert(10); println!(\"{:?}\", my_tree); } \n    submitted by    /u/etzellux  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Link to the crate\n I created this tool after having tried to bisect some rustc bugs a while ago, and discovering that there wasn't an easy way to limit the amount of memory a program can use in a multi-platform way (I'm working on Windows at home). There are a bunch of methods to do that on Linux, but I feel like they're a bit contrived and part of a greater ecosystem of limits that may not really be easy to use in the context of cargo-bisect-rustc.\n With this program, you can specify the maximum amount of memory a command can use before it gets killed (of course, if it doesn't go over that limit, then everything goes normally). If needed, you can follow children too and assert that the sum of all memory consumed by all of them doesn't go over the limit. You can also switch between RSS memory and virtual memory, if needed. So, for example:\n $ memlimit 16GiB -c cargo install ripgrep --force \n This will:\n  \nset a limit of 16GiB (gibibytes, 16 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 bytes)\n with -c, follow all children spawned by the initial program and sum up their memory usage\n monitor the command cargo install ripgrep --force\n  \nI know this isn't a really impressive or important tool, but I felt there wasn't an easy-to-use multiplatform tool to do this. It's very small and doesn't have a lot of features, so I'm super open to criticism and suggestions!\n    submitted by    /u/FennecAuNaturel  \n [link]   [comments]",

This release contains several new features and improves existing features. Diesel now provides a procedural macro attribute that infers the correct return type for your query. It's now possible to instrument connection implementations provided by diesel to perform logging and performance measurements. We added support for PostgreSQL's COPY FROM and COPY TO syntax which can be used to send and receive large amounts of data efficiently. Our dependencies wrapping the native database drivers support now all building the database driver as part of your cargo build. This enables us to distribute static precompiled versions of diesel-cli easily. Finally we worked with the Rust team to stabilize attributes to customize error messages emitted by the compiler. This is now used by diesel to improve the quality of certain otherwise hard to understand error messages. \n This release wouldn't be possible without the support of our contributors and sponsors. If you want to support diesels development, consider joining the reviewer team, submitting PR's, help writing documentation or sponsor the maintainers.\n I'm happy to answer any questions about this release or diesel in general.\n    submitted by    /u/weiznich  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone, a few days ago I watched a video called writing your own daemon in C which lead me to try to write one on my own in Rust. I am by no means a Rustacean, nor an expert. Just an average programmer curious about writing a service in Rust. \n I call the Daemon birth-hound. It is as the name suggests a daemon which notifies you if it's anyone's birthday (it can be used for notifying you about other important dates as well!). It keeps track of a CSV file which includes the birth date and the person's name. Naturally the daemon checks for all the dates and then notifies using libnotify crate. \n Here are my questions :\n  \nIs this too simple of an idea to be written as a daemon, as daemon's do consume cpu and ram resources\n \nIs there another approach to do this? I discovered that systemd uses .timer which is used for scheduling programs, so instead of writing a long running process which actually excutes instructions once in a day, you could write a .timer file and in it tell it to execute the rust file to do the checking at 11:59pm everyday\n \nDo you think it is a good idea to write it in a cli style app wherein the user can do a birth-hound start or birth-hound stop to start and stop the daemon to their wish\n \nI would access the CSV file using File IO obviously, but should I asc users to create their own CSV file and ask them to manually enter it's path into the src code or should I provide them with a CSV myself, if it's the latter, how should I go about it?\n \n That's all the questions I have for now. Feel free to ask me more questions if you have any.\n Any sort of advise or guidance would be of great help!!!

          "description": "The main issue with Rust is that it's not fast to iterate - when it compiles it runs, but your logic may be wrong, and then you may need to change your stuff and make it correct again. However, the performance is over the roof and it's memory safe - performance and memory-safety are two hard to combine features\n Clojure is in a completely different place: it's BLAZINGLY fast to iterate, but - and now, this is probably because I'm a total newb in Clojure - it's pretty weird to try to squeeze super performance out of it. It's performant alright, but it's no Rust/C++, and can probably never be, since it's garbage-collected and has some decently costed abstractions\n So I think where I want to be is to have good mastery of both languages: using Rust for anything that needs to have high-performance or for low level stuff, and Clojure as the day-to-day tool to jack-in and hack away\n Now, I don't have enough knowledge of language design to understand how viable it would be, but it'd be pretty neat to have Clojure doing interop with Rust - you jack-in into a Rust program, invoke and break Rust functions in the REPL, iterate adding stuff; when you're done you compile the experiments into Rust code and make it Rust-compilable.

          "description": "Hollo, Rustacians! \n I'm a backend developer, and I mainly use Go. I had read the Rust Book multiple times before, as I find it be insightful and interesting. Last week I had some free time, so I decided to work on my first actual project in Rust. It was a simple HTTP server. \n Overall, it was a fun experience. The type system is powerful. I felt at home with defining types and attaching methods to them. Enums are great as well. The Option type for gracefully handling null values and the Result type for more flexible error handling. It was satisfying to refactor my code to remove cloning or to use ? for early returns.\n Although, I found the compiler to be too much in the way. At some points, my speed grinded to a halt, trying to understand what I did wrong and how should I fix it. Granted, I'm new, and it's only natural to face such problems. But in many cases, I had to alter the solution I had in my mind to match what the compiler expected of me, which required so much mental energy. It was challenging in a fun way, but my productivity plummeted.\n Now that I'm fairly done with the project, it feels like I'm missing something about Rust. Surely, I'll continue to use it for my side projects, but I don't get the hype around it. What makes it so great? Is it just the challenge of writing more idiomatic code and constant refactoring, or is there something that Rust does that I'm not appreciating?\n    submitted by    /u/hossein1376  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think the one key point, which was touched on in a lot of comments, but IMO never sufficiently isolated, is this: Rust is bad at imperfection.\n Code quality (rigor, correctness, efficiency, speed, etc) always comes at the cost of time/effort. The better you want your code to be, the more time/effort you need to invest. And the closer to perfection you get, the more it takes to push even further. That much should be pretty agreeable, regardless of the language. One might argue that Rust has a much better \"quality-per-time/effort\" curve than other languages (whether this is actually true is beside the …",

          "description": "I recently released my first ever proc-macro called pack_bools. It was a nice mix of frustration and joy as i had to navigate around syn, proc-macro2, quote and all the other tools. Some problems I encountered was that while syn was awesome for parsing the TokenStream, there was really no easy way to instantiate the AST structures from it, and I was kind of lost in how I was supposed to quote structures I had destructured. Also, it was quite hard to debug, I often got error messages like unexpected ,, but even with cargo expand it was sometimes invisible. But, I managed at last, and I am proud of the final product. Feedback highly appreciated!\n As a quick decription, the macro turns structs looking like this: ```rs use pack_bools::pack_bools;\n [pack_bools]\n [derive(Debug, Clone)]\n struct Config<'a> { output_name: &'a str, verbose: bool, pub use_colors: bool, original_file: &'a std::path::Path, legacy_mode: bool } ```\n into structs looking like this:\n ```rs\n [derive(Debug, Clone)]\n struct Config<'a> { output_name: &'a str, original_file: &'a std::path::Path, packed_bools: u8 }\n impl<'a> Config<'a> { /* getters and setters for the fields, with the same visibility as the fields */ } ```\n I also added lots of configuration options, inspired by serde, so you could do #[pack_bools(newtype)] to use the newtype pattern for the packed bool field, and much more. I looked around at crates.io a bit before making this, but didn't quite find anything just like this; I found some macros that generated bitfield-structs, and some macros that could expand a u8 field into multiple boolean fields with getters and setters, but I like the \"clean\" interface this crate provides.\n As said, feedback greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/CMDJojo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone, a very long time ago (probably around 10 years actually) I used to work a bit with system called Microsoft Dynamics CRM, which has in my opinion a very interesting way of querying data called QueryExpression, an class which allowed to write queries to the system in OOP fashion. It was quite nice to work with, and I always had an idea to build something similar but for SQL (the system was actually using custom query language called FetchXML). Here is the reference to their concept - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.query.queryexpression?view=dataverse-sdk-latest\n So finally after some spare nights I've built this tiny library SQLQueryExpression NET - https://github.com/skinex/SqlQueryExpression.NET At the moment, this library is quite basic, it could handle SELECTS, WHERE conditions (nested conditions as well) JOINS (LEFT and INNER) as well as UNION and EXCEPT ALL. I do have a plans to add support for queries listed in Not Supported Queries section at some point.\n If you find this library or perhaps this approach interesting, feel free to give it a try, report any issues or contribute to the current codebase :)\n PS: I'm aware that this library is not nearly as powerful as EF Core (or even EF), or SQLKata, it's just demonstrates a way of writing queries in object oriented manner. I'm also don't really want to debate about functional vs object oriented way of building queries, I'm pretty sure everyone has very strong opinions on this matter, but it wasn't a point of this tool to prove anything regarding this topic.\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/namethinker  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone. I was wondering if I could get another perspective on this LINQ query I have written. To me it seems pretty straight forward, but seemingly it cannot be translated into SQL.\n For some context, I have the data structure which follows a 1:N relationship all the way down:\n Organization -> List of Departments -> List of Employees -> List of Tasks\n I have a table, Errors, whose records can be related to any of the above hierarchical records via the RecordId foreign key.\n For my usecase, I simply need to get the Organization, and a count of all errors for the Organization and all child records, and then include only the Error entities for the Organization itself.\n ```csharp var query = _context.Organizations .Where(o => o.Id == request.OrganizationId) .Select(o => new OrganizationWithErrorsDto( o.Id,\n o.Name,\n _context.Errors .Count(e => e.RecordId == o.Id || o.Departments.Any(d => d.Id == e.RecordId) || o.Departments.Any(d => d.Employees.Any(emp => emp.Id == e.RecordId)) || o.Departments.Any(d => d.Employees.Any(emp => emp.Tasks.Any(t => t.Id == e.RecordId)))), _context.Errors .Where(ae => e.RecordId == o.Id || o.Departments.Any(d => d.Id == e.RecordId) || o.Departments.Any(d => d.Employees.Any(emp => emp.Id == e.RecordId)) || o.Departments.Any(d => d.Employees.Any(emp => emp.Tasks.Any(t => t.Id == e.RecordId)))), ) ) .OrderBy(o => o.Name);\n return query .ProjectTo<OrganizationDto>(_mapper.ConfigurationProvider);\n public record OrganizationWithErrorsDto( Guid Id, string? Name, int? TotalErrorCount, IEnumerable<Error> Errors); ```\n  \nAm I doing anything obviously wrong?\n \nHow can I write this in a way that can be translated?\n \nAny advice/resources for how I can troubleshoot/think about this kind of problem in the future?\n  \nI find this pretty confusing because this seems like a fairly simple query and something that someone would naturally do with LINQ.\n Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/_stainless  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hope everyone enjoyed their weekend.\n This past Friday was my two year anniversary with my first full time junior software developer position. I've never done C# and I was mainly front end with JavaScript for some enterprise applications for the first year and a half. I wanted to do back end development since I was more proficient with front end and have never explored back end development at the job at all.\n This past March, I made an appointment to see both the manager and tech lead and asked if they have back end projects where I can learn and contribute to the team. They were delighted to set me up with a Microsoft & Pluralsight training program and follow through the lessons. Fast forward, I was recently assigned with a project using Entity Framework to create some repositories and boy I have never been stumped on an assignment, ever. My Imposter syndrome was creeping up at times and I felt defeated not knowing what to do.\n The team and tech lead who has way more experience in Entity Framework were very helpful every time I ran to a problem. I asked what I could do outside of work to improve my C# skills and they suggested Pluralsight foundations and Microsoft's C# documentation, which are helpful. I bought C# Player's guide a while back that I'm currently working through after work and it seems very helpful.\n It was the best decision of my (career) life because I felt that I was not progressing as a software engineer and was doing simple front end assignments. Backend is a whole different world. I'm currently getting my behind kicked doing Entity Framework but I'm learning so much about C#, the framework, and what I need to work on. If anyone else felt like they are not progressing, ask you manager to see what you could do that is more challenging or an area where you don't have expertise in and learn.\n    submitted by    /u/foureyeddriver  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have built simple programs in the lab based portion of class but we either did everything in main or used one other separate class file.\n I wanted to start doing monogame projects as fun way to practice my programming. After seeing how code is done in the real world from my internship, doing some small exercises from the C# player's guide and thinking about how I would structure my first (small) game project I realized I have no idea how I would structure even a small project.\n I know there is no right answer and it involves a lot of nuance and abstract thinking but as the question above says, how do I decide on when a csproj needs to be split up? how do I decide from the get go what functionality can be grouped into an existing project or if I need to create a new project for it? How do I know if im being too granular and splitting things into too many projects. \n I realize this a design pattern type question but I havent gotten that far yet in my course work and would appreciate some guidance in the right direction. Whether you can explain it here, know some great websites or know some great content creators that would help to answer my question, it would be wonderful to hear your thoughts! \n    submitted by    /u/Bark_bark-im-a-doggo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "At my job we're currently developing an API, with a ClientLib for the API in a NuGet package. But now we've had a bit of a discussion, how to define the DTO classes in the Client. We've come up with 4 possible solutions:\n 1. Define the classes in both the API and the ClientLib\n Duplicate code (not per se a bad thing), but there is more room for error. Fixing a bug in the API DTO and forgetting to change the library or something like that.\n 2. Define the classes in the ClientLib, and let the API include the ClientLib\n This would remove the duplicity, but feels wrong. The client should not be the owner of the DTO's, but the API. \n 3. Define the classes in the API and include the API in the ClientLib\n Would make the whole ClientLib bloated with code it doesn't need.\n 4. Create a seperate Library with the DTO's, which get included in both the API and the ClientLib\n Feels like a lot of extra complexity for such a small problem.\n Currently we've gone with Number 1. Sure some duplicate code, but it's a total seperation of concerns. And each DTO can have some utility functions specifically for the API or Client.\n I guess I'm not the only one working with API and Clients this way, so really interested in how others solve this \"problem\". \n    submitted by    /u/MrCorba  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello reddit, I’ve built a global serverless API gateway which handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, monitoring transformations etc.\n It’s entirely built on top of C# and .NET8 and uses the Microsoft Reverse Proxy (https://github.com/microsoft/reverse-proxy) at it’s core, for proxying the requests. It’s also inspired by the .NET architecture, with the notion of routes and middlewares and comes with a nice interface to configure everything in minutes (no code required).\n There are three main concepts:\n  \nRoutes - paths that define different operations in your API (can be with dynamic, optional or catch-all parameters). It uses the .NET route matching for processing requests.\n Backends - a cluster of endpoints where the requests will be proxied to\n Middlewares - functions that are executed in a specific order in Routify edge proxies and define how requests are processed. These are similar as the .NET middlewares and policies approach. You can have global middlewares in app level that apply to all routes or you can have route specific middlewares. You can also disable a specific app middleware or you can disable all app middlewares in a specific route.\n  \nSo far, it has processed 100+ million requests and works very fast (.NET8 is amazing). The average processing time for route matching and middleware processing is ~1ms (this does not include the network operations when proxying the requests).\n Routify makes it easier to manage and secure public APIs. It's distributed across many regions globally and acts as a proxy between your clients and your services.\n You can use it as a reverse proxy, as a gateway between your APIs in different cloud providers, as a geo load balancer or simply as a monitoring tool for all requests going through your API.\n For those interested, Routify is in public beta and freee to use at https://routify.to\n Check it out and let me know if you have any feedback or question. I’m happy to answer them.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/RoutifyTo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all. I have used Entity Framework for some project in the past, both with .net framework and .net core, in database first and code first version. \n Coming to the conclusion that it is more disadvantages than advantages, while it makes my life easier on the other hand it introduces other problems , e.g. hard to write queries, read in linq. Excessive uncontrolled reads on the db and various headaches caused by unexpected engine behavior.\n After shelving Ef for years in favor of dapper (I got along very well with Dapper there is I used it for many projects), I continued to use entity only to generate filtered queries automatically . \n Now I have to start a new very complex project and am writing the framework to be reused for various sub projects. I am adopting Ef code first, convinced by colleagues, however I keep thinking it will be a source of problems more than a real advantage and various limitations and difficulties are emerging already in the first tests where we are forced to use raw sql for partial updates in the la unit of work. \n So I would like to use dapper and/or sugarsql on all queries at least at the framework level.\n Also considering that what I used to write with ef 7 years ago is pretty much to trash and what I wrote with dapper is fully functional , I think that ef in the long run its not the right choice.\n What is your experience with ef/dapper/sugar sql? What do you think of my reasoning?\n Thanks \n    submitted by    /u/xil987  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Considering a “Windows tweaking” program to do a few things that many other Windows-castration apps don’t seem to be doing. But I haven’t exactly done a Windows program before, at least in terms of an executable program that can be run in portable format, and possibly even installed (in some future version) for scheduled monitoring.\n In general, when dealing with Windows internals for purely Win10 and Win11, would you preferentially reach for a DotNet Framework or a DotNet Core setup?\n Looking for reasoning. My background is mainly in Enterprise-level CRUD Intranet apps for companies, which would run locally on their network from a server. So it’s not like I have oodles of experience creating programs for the desktop. I know Framework is on it’s way out, but I have also heard that it still has superior third-party resources for Windows-specific capabilities and needs.\n The vast majority of the app’s functionality will be in modifying the registry in a safe/programmatic way, and running specific PowerShell commands. Depending on requirements, some may be isolated as vertical slice components, others may have a shared “applying engine” against which instructions can be run. This will be protected behind a very simple checkbox-based or slider-button-based UI.\n Final note: this will NOT be released through the Windows Store, as I highly doubt it would ever get approved there. Straight download only. I also intend this to have a more traditional Windows-like UI, and a standard *.exe binary with no external files except for text-based “sanity/changes-implemented references” that are filename-locked to whatever system they were generated against, in case the executable ends up on a USB stick or network share to be applied to multiple systems.\n    submitted by    /u/rekabis  \n [link]   [comments]",

Usually only 2 seconds but even that isn't fast enough for me. \n When I had this app completely in powershell, I accepted it being due to the fact it was in powershell. Interpreted is going to be slow compared to compiled\n But this one is entirely WMI-based, no powershell, no cmdline arguements, just C# using WMI calls. And it's compiled. \n So I'm looking for ways to make my app faster. Ideally it'd take it 1 second - no more - to delete the current TPMAndPin protector, delete the current Numerical Password, change the TpmAndPin protector to the user's input and then export the auto-generated Numerical Password to the given location\n As I said, sometimes this takes 2 seconds, sometimes 4-5. Ideal time would be 1 second.\n I'd go for asynchronous but in this case these things have to happen in this specific order. If the TpmAndPin isn't deleted before a new one is created, the new one won't be created because the system cannot contain more than 1 TpmAndPin protector.\n Can I get some help with this?

          "description": "Hi, today i found really interesting repository, \n Chainski/Terminator: Terminator is a compact utility coded in C#, designed to end processes that have RtlSetProcessIsCritical enabled. (github.com)\n How it Works ?\n Terminator defines a method called UnProtectAndTerminate that aims to terminate a specified process after removing its protection. It utilizes platform invoke to call functions from system DLLs. First, it imports functions from ntdll.dll and kernel32.dll. These functions are NtSetInformationProcess to alter process information and TerminateProcess to forcibly terminate a process. Within the UnProtectAndTerminate method, it enters debug mode using Process.EnterDebugMode(). Then it attempts to open the target process using OpenProcess, passing necessary parameters including the process ID. Afterward, it calls NtSetInformationProcess with appropriate arguments to remove the process protection. If successful, it terminates the process using TerminateProcess with an exit code of 0. \n Why was this tool made ?\n I developed this tool specifically designed to terminate processes containing the RtlSetProcessIsCritical feature, after encountering several malware samples utilizing this technique during my analysis.\n    submitted by    /u/Temporary_Hope_7198  \n [link]   [comments]",

At page 211, the author recommends not to resolve scoped or transient services directly from the root DI container, because can lead to \"leaking of memory\".\n  \nWARNING Don’t resolve scoped or transient services directly from WebApplication.Services.\n This approach can lead to leaking of memory, as the objects are kept alive till the app exits and aren’t garbage-collected.\n  \nBut for scoped services, you cannot resolve a scoped service without having a scope, you need to create a scope first! And even if you forget to dispose the scope, it will eventually go garbage collected and disposed. How can a memory leak be produced?\n For transient services, you cannot have a memory leak, because that's how transient services work, an instance is created every time, the container does not keep an instance to it.\n Next, another recommendation which is confusing:\n  \nInstead, you should only resolve scoped and transient services from an active scope.\n  \nAlways resolve transient services from an active scope!? What does scope have to do with transient services?\n Although I am senior engineer myself, I wanted to ask a clarification further, here that's why I posted it here.\n DISCLAIMER: My goal here is not to try call out the book or the author in any way!!!

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n I've recently put significant effort into enhancing my library for generating fluent builders and I believe it has now matured enough to be applied to most use cases. Fluent builders are very convenient but writing them can be tedious. The idea of this library is to generate the builder class from attributes on the properties and methods of the class to be built. The latest updates include\n  \nSupport for generics and partial classes\n Enabling of optional builder methods\n Branching capabilities\n Support for returning arbitrary types\n  \nIf you're new to this library, you may find the storybook helpful. It explains the library step by step and provides a comprehensive overview of its features. You can find a link to the storybook, as well as additional examples, in the readme on GitHub.\n To illustrate the usefulness of the library, you can have a look at the diagrams in this excellent blog post by Mitesh. The fluent API described in the post can be crafted in about 5 minutes using the library. An implementation can be found in the comments of the blog post, as well as in the example project included with the library.\n Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions. If you would like to get some input on how to use the library in your use case, please create a GitHub issue with the label `design help request` and you will receive timely feedback.\n Happy Coding!,\n Kevin\n    submitted by    /u/kmschaal2  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also have probably an hour or three a day to spend on this hobby project. That includes learning c sharp, learning pixel art/drawing (I also dont know that) and making the game.

However, I'm having trouble using them when fields are initialized in a method called by a framework or a game engine, such as Godot or Unity. Example:\n #nullable enable // Example 1 - I will set _graphics in the Godot editor UI, // and I want the game to crash if I don't. [Export] private Sprite2D? _graphics; private Sprite2D? _someOtherSprite; private Set<Node2D>? _setOfThings; public override void _Ready() { // Example 2 - _Ready is guaranteed to be called once, // before any other method from this class is called. _someOtherSprite = GetNode<Sprite2D>(\"SomeNode\"); } public void MyMethod() { // I want both these fields to be considered non-null here. _graphics.Scale = _someOtherSprite.Scale; _graphics.DoSomething(); // I still want strict null checks for everything else. if (_setOfThings != null) _setOfThings.Add(_graphics); } \n Ideally I'd like a field or property to be excluded from nullability checking if it is initialized in _Ready, or if _Ready has an assertion like ThrowIfNull(_graphics) for that field.\n Is this currently possible in C#, given that these variables are not initialized in the constructor? If not, what are some workarounds I can use to exclude some fields from nullability checking?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/smthamazing  \n [link]   [comments]",

(ThrowIfNull)\n I was wondering, why there is only an exception as well as a null-check static method for arguments but not for values in general?\n I mean I could easily use the ArgumentNullException for that, but imo that is bad for DX since ArgumentNullException is implying that an argument is null not a value of a variable.\n The only logical reason I can come up with is, that the language doesn't want to encourage you to throw an exception when a value is null and rather just have a normal null-check, but then I ask myself why the language encourages that usage for arguments? \n    submitted by    /u/ThatCipher  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I have a simple problem which drives me crazy. \n I have two projects, same code, console app, one in .NET framework 4.7.1 the other dotnet6. Both attempts to receive UDP packets from an external device.\n Here's code (cannot be simpler)\n ``` using System; using System.Net; using System.Net.Sockets; using System.Text;\n class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { int listenPort = 4005; string broadcaster = \"192.168.0.88\";\n  using (UdpClient listener = new UdpClient(listenPort)) { IPEndPoint groupEP = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(broadcaster), listenPort); try { Console.WriteLine($\"Listening for UDP broadcasts from {broadcaster} on port {listenPort}\"); while (true) { byte[] bytes = listener.Receive(ref groupEP); string receivedData = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytes, 0, bytes.Length); Console.WriteLine($\"Received broadcast from {groupEP} : {receivedData}\"); } } catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine(e.ToString()); } } } \n } ```\n When I debug in dotnet6 it all works as intended. In .NET framework it simply waits for messages and nothing happens. It's the same if I run it in 'release', even from executable. I was running the code on Windows 10 x64 machine.\n But actually the code is intended to run on Windows7 Embedded (x86) device. What's irritating, any of the codes (not dotnet6 nor .net framework) works on that...\n Do you happen to have any ideas what may be the reason of such weird behavior? Where should I search for problems?\n Thanks in advance. yngwie\n    submitted by    /u/yngwieHero  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey guys,\n I'm trying to come up with a secure and reliable authentication solution for the project I'm working on. \n I consists of a React Web SPA and a Flutter mobile app, of course using ASP.NET Core as a REST API-only backend. I'm not sure how to tackle the problem of authenticating my users to both clients. A user can login using same account on both apps.\n I have some requirements that have to be met and some problems:\n  \nI don't to use an external identity provider like Auth0 or Firebase. I want to store user credentials in my own database. I have no problem with writing some password-hashing code myself.\n Native login: I don't want to open a browser window in my mobile app or redirect to another page in SPA, so I don't use OAuth\n Use cookies for the web app and Header-Authorization for the mobile app? It is considered insecure using localStorage for authentication tokens in SPAs\n Session management: I tend to use Server-Side-Sessions that are stored in the database. Users in the mobile app stay logged in infinitely, users in the web app should be logged out after 30 days of inactivity.\n How to pass the session ID to the mobile app if we can't use cookies the same way as in the Web app? Should we transmit it in the body JSON? Should the API check for a authentication token in both locations (Cookie and Header)\n Session rotation: When someone signs in, the server-side session token is generated and stored in the database, until it expires or the user logs out. Do I need some kind of rotation for this token?\n  \nWhat would you recommend? Do you have any examples for this use case or any libraries that I might use?\n Thanks a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/Loris156  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Good day. Just a brief introduction of myself. I'm an IT Programmer working for a manufacturing company for less than a year. This is my 1st job and throughout my tenure so far, my team and I are using a low-code software that allows us to finish web-based projects for production in less than a month.\n Last month I was told I will be moved to a new branch of IT. Because of this, I was told to study ASP.NET MVC. I will be mentored by a foreign senior IT. However, the mentoring was not as sophisticated as I imagined. They gave me no online courses, there are no curriculums, and they told me to just Google any technical-related stuff. I asked where will I learn jQuery and my mentor just gave me the link to the jQuery website. So, my learning was not structured. I hop from one article to another to learn ASP.NET MVC and watch different teachers in YouTube, and via reading the system code written in ASP MVC. It was not a fun experience, but in the end I achieved their expectations. Because of this, they made me the leader. \n Now for my scenario, since I know ASP.NET, they now tasked me to create a curriculum for new IT's that will be working/learning from me. I imagined my IT Head/Manager is better suited for this task because he likely knows a lot of programming in general or what the business needs, but he pushed this task on me for reasons I don't know. Since my learning was unmodulated and unstructured, and I know for a fact that the way they made me learn C# ASP.NET MVC was not for everyone, I'm utterly clueless on what online course will be effective in gearing new IT's for application development in C# be it ASP.NET or desktop application. The company is paying whatever it may be so there's that. All I know is this... whatever course it may be, it must have a certificate at the end, so the new IT's can put it in their personal website or resume for their future jobs, unlike me.\n I'm utterly clueless. Can anyone suggest? Thank you...\n    submitted by    /u/JoeNaks  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I have some lines like this in my code. This is part of a process which creates rows in a DB based on an input Excel file and other info from the DB. My boss wants the calculation of these final fields to be very flexible so formulas for some of them are stored on the DB as C# scripts.\n //Set up the formula execution string formula = config.Formula; var options = ScriptOptions.Default.AddReferences(typeof(ConsolidatedTBRow).Assembly); var globals = new ScriptGlobals { row = tbRow }; //Execute the formula value = CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync<object?>(formula, options, globals: globals).Result.ToString(); \n The problem is that when using a real input file, this code runs 4 times for each of the 38k rows in the input file. And, apparently, each time you run Evaluate on a CSharpScript it creates a process that then is not disposed of. This is causing memory to balloon a crazy amount until I get an out of memory error.\n I've seen a lot of other people mention this issue online but can't find any solutions. I found one fairly complicated one here but this doesn't seem to allow passing parameters to the script (my row variable) which I need to be able to do.\n EDIT: I ended up using DynamicExpresso instead of Roslyn. Not only did it solve my issue, it's also easier to use and my program runs insanely faster. Like, it used to take over an hour to run, and it just finished in about 10 minutes. I can't believe this library didn't come up when I was searching for how to run dynamic scripts in C#\n    submitted by    /u/ShadowShine57  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I'm finding that I'm implementing the interface far too much.\n To provide an example, consider this simple application structure:\n class Program {} class Server {} class Service {} class DataProvider {} class DatabaseConnection {} \n Here, the program creates a server which manages a service that uses DataProvider to interact with a database.\n If the DatabaseConnection is disposable and managed by the DataProvider , then shouldn't DataProvider also be disposable? And if the DataProvider is disposable and managed by Service... then shouldn't Service also be disposable? And if the Service is disposable and managed by Server...\n Where does the cycle stop? When do we avoid implementing the IDisposable interface on objects that manage disposable resources?\n Consider this implementation for Service:\n class Service { void Start(); void Stop(); } \n if the Service lifetime is managed with the Start() and Stop() methods, can we dispose resources in Stop()? Or is it still preferred to implement IDisposable here and invoke Dispose(true) in the Stop method?\n    submitted by    /u/lowhearted  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basic logic works like this: each savable item returns its own specific type of SaveState object, which is then serialized into Json. So Foo returns FooSaveState and Bar returns BarSaveState.\n It all worked pretty nicely until I reached the point where I need to save a state machine that is set up like this: there's an abstract Behavior class from which each specific state derives. The program has a List<Behavior> myBehaviors and during each update loop it calls myBehaviors[activeBehavior].Execute(). Each derived Behavior has its own set of internal data that I can't generalize out in a global BehaviorSaveState class because otherwise it would be a huge mess and a bit of a waste of space.\n Since I figured I'd save only the active state, I thought I'd solve the issue by writing in Behavior an abstract Save() method that returns a generic System.Object, then each derived behaviors overrides it with its own, specific SaveState class.\n Saving works well and the data written in the file is correct, but loading breaks, because I discovered that the deserialization, rather than a System.Object object, gives me a JsonElement object which I can't seem to be able to deserialize further, nor cast into the correct SaveState class.\n Help, please?

          "description": "We moved to .NET 7 a while back, took forever because of management and late support in Azure Service fabric. Anyway.. This opened up for required keyword which makes EF Core play nicer with nullable reference types.\n My suggested way foward is this. For all columns that are non null in sql map that to a none nullable reference type in the Entity and use required keyword so that object inilizers can be used. When inserting new entities this means either supply the child entity or if you only have the Id fool the compiler by using null!\n db.AddAsync(new Entity { NavPropId = 1, NavProp = null! }); \n Personaly I think this is pretty ok, and on the query side we always Project. For collections we do\n public required ICollection<T> NavProps { get; set; } = new List<T>(); \n This way we can avoid nullable type which requires you work around it in queries and projections using ! like\n .Select(x => x.MyNoneNullableCollection!.Select(y => ...)); \n Only real downside is that it allocates. But since we project its minimal allocation.\n What do you guys think, is it a good practice, any feedback or ideas are gladly taken. Thanks\n Update: There is nothing gained by doing { get; set; } = new List<T>(). Only risk for mistakes, if the developer misses to do a Invlude he will get a empty collection instead of the actual collection.

          "description": "Hi everyone!\n I'm a junior dev and my first task is to create a CLI-Tool for our internal use. I think that I'm not the worst programmer, but it's my first job using C#. Before that I worked 3 years with web-stack languages.\n I put much emphasize on clean code practices and I try to learn to become better at it every day.\n Now my question:\n I would love to log each step that is happening and I want to add a verbosity Option to the tool but currently the code is very messy because of all the writing to the console. And I also think that Classes that aren't responsible for the commands and command execution shouldn't be concerned with outputting text.\n Now I want to know if there is a more common way or pattern to ensure console output without cluttering the code with many console writing calls or a cleaner more readable way. \n Please feel free to \"critize\" as much as you want - even if it's not related but is something I mentioned. I think I'll learn the best when I know what I'm doing wrong. Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ThatCipher  \n [link]   [comments]",

I started C# on the 1st of April to get into newer skills and I wanted to show you all the progress I made, here is a small list of aps I made :\n -Ticking bomb Game\n -A calculator (that takes ints , but not floats lol)\n -A inheritance model with a Timer to call some methods made and a few more!\n -Working in making WPF application, Ive attached a small project I'm working on\n Right now I am learning WPF as well to get more extra skills and just got a feel of XML and HTML which is frankly not so hard. Overall I have been going through every single topic of basic C# tools and I mostly grasp what they are used for and made small little example to get a better feel.\n But that's all , I hope you like it\n https://preview.redd.it/7ofzki79113d1.png?width=1213&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7c08aee01d4dec0beaa79c5afb894d4b62aec42\n https://preview.redd.it/l92o7r49113d1.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f1bbef53e14f024259200ce11b8db67a9d9879a\n https://preview.redd.it/1utx1r49113d1.png?width=1436&format=png&auto=webp&s=40ed0df4eafd92406eac357a4e5f414d19009eae\n    submitted by    /u/OceanMann70  \n [link]   [comments]",

Make the Model an observable object with observable properties and update Viewmodel properties from the model. Or make some sort of \"GameManager\" state class that can manage the game object and communicate to the Viewmodels. How would you handle this? Specifically I'm worried if I have a single Game instance and multiple Viewmodels that can interact with it I will have thread safety issues. My code started getting pretty complex for something that I'm guessing should be simple. What am I missing?\n    submitted by    /u/andersonee  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a C# beginner but trying to learn how to apply my current knowledge into web development (any advice or pointers would be appreciated :) ). The one issue that I'm struggling with is understanding the difference between Blazor and ASP.NET and when should I choose one over the other. It seems like ASP.NET is the older and battle tested framework while Blazor is the new(er) kid on the block. Blazor seems (I might be wrong) easier to learn and has more eye candy/UX type stuff in it.\n I'm cautious about picking it up because it seems like the big thing that I got out of reading this sub is that Microsoft has a habit of releasing a new technology/framework and then abandoning it if it doesn't get enough traction. Is that something that I should be concerned about with using a newer technology like Blazor? Or has Blazor received enough traction that the chances of that happening are low? Or does it not even matter because the skill sets and code are transferable between the two?\n    submitted by    /u/Heli0sX  \n [link]   [comments]",

As a result, i1 and i2 reference the same object, so they return true.\n I'd be glad if someone could explain how the intern works and why the results differ?\n PS: I'm running it in .net 7 in local and 8 in online compilers.\n    submitted by    /u/PhantomGolem  \n [link]   [comments]",

I attempted using a TCP socket where the client sends Isaac Sim outputs to a server running on the local IP (e.g., '127.0.0.1:8080'). I have verified the connection through a web browser by running Flask on \"127.0.0.1:5000/video\". On the web browser, it works fine by displaying when sending a video file, but after changing the source of the frame, namely editing #VideoCapture(0) to a webcam it doesn't work. \n However, in my C# project, when I set the IP to 127.0.0.1 and the port to 8080, there's a second port number. (is it optional or not?). I don't actually have a physical Raspberry Pi camera module; there is just an option in the C# project to select a Raspberry Pi camera. Is sending frames from Isaac Sim to this option in the C# project equivalent to sending frames from a Raspberry Pi camera module to the C# project?

If you manage Active Directory and Azure AD synchronization in your environment, this might be useful for you!\n https://github.com/TheITApprentice/AD-Sync-Manager\n AD Sync Manager is designed to help streamline and simplify the AD to Azure AD sync process. It provides an easy way to monitor sync status, get alerted on issues, and manage sync cycles.\n With this tool, you can:\n  \nView the status of your AD Connect sync cycles\n Get notified if delta or initial sync fails\n Manually trigger full or delta syncs\n Analyze sync errors to identify objects with issues\n And more!\n  \nIt's built with PowerShell so it should be easy to deploy in most AD/Azure environments. I'm actively developing it and welcome any feedback or suggestions.\n If you struggle with keeping your on-prem and cloud directories in sync, give AD Sync Manager a try. Let me know if you have any questions - I'm happy to help!\n Hopefully this tool saves you some time and headaches.

I have several references to the `okhttp` dependency in various pom.xml files in my repo, all of them specify version 4.12.0 but for some reason, my builds keep downloading the old version (4.9.3). My only guess is that some other library that I'm using also uses okhttp but I can't tell which one. I could be completely wrong about that too.\n I've been digging through POMs and releases on Maven Central, in the okhttp GitHub repo. I've also been fiddling with `jdeps` and `mvn dependency:tree`. I have been tearing my hair out over this one. . . any help is appreciated.\n EDIT: I should also add that my project uses Java 1.8 and I cannot change that unfortunately (because all of the original developers are gone and I do not have the time/resources to upgrade to a newer JDK).\n    submitted by    /u/tech_tuna  \n [link]   [comments]",

I really like his design and am considering adding him as a character to a freeware video game I'm working on, but I want to make sure I'm able to legally do so. The in-game appearance of him would be an original model I create for the game, so I'm also not sure if I would be crediting specifically the Duke project repository as its owner. The game also isn't coded in Java, though I'm not entirely sure if that would affect whether the character can be used or not. Obviously, I would put a notice somewhere in my game that Orcale isn't affiliated with the game in any way.\n    submitted by    /u/infinityJKA  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! First and foremost, I apologize for any ignorance or nativity throughout this post, I’m still a teenager in college and do appreciate the infinite wealth of knowledge I lack.\n I have written a decent amount of Java years ago (within the scope of Minecraft) so I’m syntactically comfortable and have a decent understand of the more common interworkings of the language, but these days I do most of my work (backend, mainly) with Golang.\n I’m curious, are new systems even being built with Java anymore, like does the language have life outside of necessity of maintaining older software? I understand that much of its edge came from its portability, but now that I can containerize a NodeJS server and deploy it just about anywhere, what is the point?\n This isn’t coming from a perspective of arguing the language is “dead” (as stupid of an expression as that is) rather I genuinely want to be educated by actual Java programmers to what the longevity of the language will look like going forward.\n TLDR: Why build with Java when there are much faster alternatives?\n Have a great day!\n    submitted by    /u/Beamxrtvv  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would like to add React to it, but I don't really know how to configure project to make everything work together and I can't find tutorial on this topic.\n I would like to compile both frontend and backend into war file for deployment. I would also like to make everything work as \"one project\" instead running everything on separate ports (I am not sure if this is good or not?). Like I would not like to run each time Java and Node separately if that is possible.\n Best tutorial I saw was this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5tcZoNyqGI but he is working with Maven and he is using proxy which I am not sure if it can be avoided (or that is best option)? He is also depending on some plugins to deploy React and Maven together which I would like to avoid so I don't depend on someone updating their plugin when new version of Java/React comes out and something changes.\n Maybe this is not hard thing to do, but I have basically zero experience in configuring project in this kind of way.\n Any advice is welcome\n    submitted by    /u/TurbulentMonitor1300  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Seems that the problem with checked exceptions is not about how verbose they are or how bad they scale (propagate) in the project, nor how ugly they make the code look or make it hard to write code. It is that you simply can't enforce someone to handle an error 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐲, despite enforcing dealing with the error at compile time.\n Although the intention is good, as Brian Goetz said once:\n  \nChecked exceptions were a reaction, in part, to the fact that it was too easy to ignore an error return code in C, so the language made it harder to ignore\n  \nyet, static checking can't enforce HOW those are handled. Which makes almost no difference between not handling or handling exceptions but in a bad way. Hence, it is inevitable to see people doing things like \"try {} catch { /* do nothing */ }\". Even if they handle exceptions, we can't expect everyone to handle them equally well. After all, someone just might deliberately want to not handle them at all, the language should not prevent that either.\n Although I like the idea, to me, checked exceptions bring more problems than benefits.\n    submitted by    /u/turik1997  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to share a situation I'm in and get your opinions on it.\n Recently, I had a technical interview that went quite well, and I've been offered a position. However, instead of using Spring Boot, the company uses Java Vert.x. I've been researching Vert.x and set up a demo project to get familiar with the technology. It seems interesting, especially depending on the complementary libraries they use, like ORM Hibernate Reactive, among others.\n My main concern is about switching from Spring, a highly demanded framework with great prospects, to Vert.x. I feel it's a step out of my \"comfort zone,\" not so much technically, but in terms of stability and the future of the technology. With the threat of Loom, Virtual Threads, and other developments, I'm worried whether the ecosystem of libraries around Vert.x is modern and follows industry standards, or if it's more oriented towards \"legacy\" solutions.\n I've been with my current company for about six months, and while I'm not completely happy with the team and tools, the conditions and environment are not ideal. The new offer has a significant salary increase and other social benefits that are very appealing, but Vert.x is the only point where I have doubts.\n Do you think it's worth leaving Spring Boot, even temporarily, and betting on reactive programming with Vert.x? Has anyone here made a similar switch and could share their experience? Should I consider this \"leap of faith\" or keep looking for opportunities that align more with my experience in Spring Boot?\n I appreciate any advice or experiences you can share.\n PD: I'm 24 years old, so I'm young. 2-3 years experience.\n    submitted by    /u/byHelper  \n [link]   [comments]",

As I do some research about it so far, they added one more layer which is Virtual Thread and instead of blocking at the Platform Thread layer, which is consider to be expensive in order to create or perform context switching, now we block at the Virtual Thread layer which is way more cheaper and consume less memory using continuation and yield similar to couroutine in Kotlin. I agree that this approach would provide better performance. However, it doesn't provide some kind of non-blocking or asynchronous feature out of the box at all it still keep blocking but just at the difference layer.\n PS, my intention was just asking for knowledge I might miss understand something.

The last release was in 2017, so maybe there is a better book to learn the theory that you can recommend for me. Also if you would have some other tips (what should projects contain, what tools should I learn etc.) for someone like me who is trying to find his first tech job, I would be grateful.\n Thanks for every response, and I hope everyone reading this has a wonderful day!\n    submitted by    /u/DependentAlarmed6587  \n [link]   [comments]",

It allows some flexibility and Shows compliance and knowledge of the ecosystem you are working in.\n  \nYou must use the Dave package \n  \nIs always terrible, it Is going to result in the exact same implementation practically every time and teaches you nothing.\n 2: Do not ask for a specific feature, ask for a feature to be created, allow them to be creative and give a time frame on how long it should take And some guidance on things you'll be looking for. \n  \nMake me a feature we are looking for it to be Very scalable and used by millions of people every day.\n  \nA developer will look at this and think how can I demonstrate scalability on a feature.\n  \nMake me a voting application at 10:00 o'clock have a email to Frederick\n  \nThis is crap, You're gonna have exactly the same result every time and teaches you nothing.\n 3: Do not ask for more than one application to be built if you are asking for a restful api ask for it to be completed with tests (Functional/ Unit / Postman) not a ui , Building a ui for a application is another application especially if it's an spa. \n Don't waste anyone's time like for real.\n These are just three simple rules for a better experience than and better candidates.\n    submitted by    /u/TheSkyNet  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's obviously straight forward to so by an if-test, but I'd favor a getFirstOrElse. My experience after using the API is that I quite often end up with something like:\n var firstOrDefault = l.isEmpty() ? defaultValue : l.getFirst();\n and there's nothing wrong with that. But it feels like this could also have been built into the API. E.g.\n var firstOrDefault = l.getFirstOrElse(defaultValue);\n    submitted by    /u/Admirable-Avocado888  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been here for 3 years and admittedly haven't been doing well for most of my time here.\n My manager has been hot and cold with my quarterly reviews - one review he'll say I'm doing better and improving at a great pace, and another he's giving me what is essentially a PIP. I know I should've tried to leave sooner but I was stubborn and genuinely thought I could improve. I find the code base difficult to understand and navigate, but thought that with enough time it would eventually click. I'm not a lazy worker, I put out good work but my manager says I'm not fast enough with it.\n Recently he approached me basically telling me I'm on the verge of losing my job. He's already in touch with HR about it. I'm on some accommodations for health issues so he said they won't let me go right away, but that upper management is \"looking for a small team of high performers\". I have no idea if anybody else is going through the same thing as me. At this rate I don't expect to have my job by next month or so. It feels as though no matter how hard I try, it doesn't make a difference. I'm heartbroken because this whole ordeal left me feeling like maybe I'm just not cut out to be a good engineer/programmer.\n I've been looking for other positions internally for my level, but those are hard to come by, are usually for other countries, and receive literally thousands of applications, so I haven't even been able to get a single interview after at least two months of looking.\n I love working here and ideally I would like to stay. But I already have two \"PIPs\" on my record. So getting an internal position feels impossible. And with the way the industry is right now, I'm afraid of being without a job for a long time to come.\n What are my options? What would you do in my position?

My salary progression so far in my career is:\n job 1: internship - unpaid - 4 months\n job 2: part time - $14/hr - 6 months\n job 3: full time - $55k/year - 1 year (current job)\n All of these jobs are software engineering roles, none of them are larger tech companies/FAANG\n I really want to make a substantial increase in my salary, and am willing to wait a longer amount of time to apply and keep trying to meet this salary since I am comfortable in my current job. My salary goal for my next job is something between $80k-$100k. When I brought this up with my mom, she said that this was probably unreasonable and that I should keep my expectations low, especially considering my pay in the past. I live in Texas, and have graduated from a top 50 cs university. How unreasonable is it to achieve this salary in this market? Am I setting my expectations too high?\n    submitted by    /u/AgileTiger3987  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Yep. It's one of those \"If it's too good to be true, it is\" moments.\n It all started when I applied to jobs on job boards, much like anyone does. Then I got an email asking to confirm my interest in a position. I said yes, then got an ODT file (like a word doc) with interview question and answers. Nothing too crazy, just regular interview questions (nothing asking for something too personal). I sent the email and got an email for a soft offer of $60/hr as a junior. I'm excited! It even comes with a stipend for a home office.\n After seeing inconsistencies between email signatures and a feeling of this being off, I call their HQ phone number. Yep, it's a scam. No one I've talked to works there.\n I had heard of a scam online where a company would send you a list of things to buy for your home office and send a check for the stipend. Then either the check would never come and you're stuck having bought so much equipment, or the check bounces. Also the fact that they require you to buy through their vendor also adds that they're stealing legitimate dollars.\n I'm not posting this to fearmonger, as I know much like everyone else here who's worked hard for the chance to get a job in software engineering & development they're doing everything to get a chance.

Coding and tech is cool but I’m not in love with it. Are there certs or paths that I could take that would be a little more stable with the tech and that would maintain my salary of approximately $150k?\n Update: I do have some data analytic and sys admin experience which are more stable but the pay is significantly lower than where I am now.\n Update 2: I am well aware, as many have pointed out, that every job requires you to constantly learn. Not every job however requires you to reinvent your core skills every 5-10 yrs (JavaScript to Angular to React for example) nor does every job have intense panel technical interviews that one must practice for consistently. Data analyst positions (what u was before software developers) have to learn things but their core skills of sql and tableau are not going anywhere.

My manager expected me to be done with this work within a couple weeks. Its been 2 months and ive barely made progress.

          "description": "I am 28 working at an investment bank. I have an undergrad in finance and law from a target, but have taught myself python to the point where I have automated the most tedious aspects of the job using web scrapers, pandas/matplotlib, and bloomberg API connections. \n I haven't told my team or junior peers how I do everything so much faster than them but they have some idea because they see lines of code in Jupyter on my screen all day. The most tedious part of my job has become exporting my works to excel and linking formulas when someone higher up wants to see my workings (though this is becoming less common as trust is built over time). \n I'm growing more and more keen on the idea of spending some serious time after work (which I have enough of) embarking on a more formal CS training path with a view to build a portfolio of simple apps and hopefully retrain to a full time CS career. My linear algebra is a bit rusty but I am familiar enough that I think I could get back on the horse in a few months.\n I guess I want some feedback on whether my age rules me out of transitioning to CS at a level that would be comparable to my existing career path in IB. \n edit: thank you all for your input and wisdom. my takeaway is that I should stick to my current career path (which I don't mind) but pursue cs as a side hobby to the extent that I am able to continue teaching myself. I guess FAANG is probably out of the question, and it seems that would be the only way to match the comp potential of my current job. I realise being an ok programmer in finance is a very long way from the forefront of the industry. \n    submitted by    /u/defeatedmac  \n [link]   [comments]",

The most stressful aspect for me is the expectation of working overtime, even sometimes during the weekends, with no extra pay. I'm usually understanding if it's about something important, like fixing a broken feature in production, but it's a bit hard on the mental when I'm asked to work otherwise.\n It's even gotten to the point where I'm having to drop whatever I'm doing in my personal life to attend 1-2-hour meetings at 7/8pm. I'm at the point now where I carry my work wherever I go, and, by that, I mean that I'm not only anxious about being messaged about work out of the blue (say, if I'm out with friends or spending time with my parents), but I also just can't get off of work mode because of it. I can't relax.\n I've talked about this with some (and, by \"some\" I mean only 3) friends in the industry, and their advice was the same: \"Then work for a corporate company. Clock out at 5 and relax.\". That's been their personal experiences, but I'm wondering if this is the experience people have in general having worked for corporate companies.\n    submitted by    /u/necromatcha  \n [link]   [comments]",

I created a project, FlyMile pro, a flight search engine that finds flights on credit card points. Originally designed to enhance my resume and secure internships, it surprisingly attracted over 10,000 sign-ups!\n However, recently, I've been facing some distressing challenges. The CEO of PointsYeah has accused me of scraping their website, a claim that is entirely baseless (I have my GitHub commits, my code never interacted with his site). I hadn't even heard of PointsYeah until about a month ago, when I stumbled upon a mention in a Reddit post, Despite this, I received a message threatening to shut down my site (see message screenshot).\n Last night, our website was bombarded with an unusual amount of traffic, which seemed like a deliberate attack, and I've been receiving calls from random international numbers. I even found MilesLife - his previous company having payments issues with merchants - I will not comment anything on that, you are free to explore.\n I’m feeling quite overwhelmed by this, especially since this project was meant to be a positive addition to my learning and future opportunities. I've worked hard to create something useful and educational, not just for myself but for a broader community.\n Has anyone here experienced something similar? How did you handle it?

I've never actually been in a situation like this so I have no clue how to approach the topic of compensation in my next meeting with the hiring manager. What should I even be asking for?

How would you proceed in this situation?\n Edit: Just to be clear, I got my \"market value\" of $150k by looking at websites like Levels.fyi and Blind, along with just what I've been generally seeing on job listings on LinkedIn, Indeed etc. I've been looking for 3-4 months now so I've seen A LOT of JDs. That being said, I am also looking only for remote jobs which may be skewing it to be a bit lower. This salary range of 176k+ is definitely above average. I don't think I'm selling myself short.

          "description": "I've been developing since the 2000s. In the good old days, most SDEs seemed to follow a simple rule that worked well for everyone: if you don't need an answer right away or just conveying information, send an email; if you do need a quick response, send an instant message. That way, I could answer emails all at once, on my own time (usually a couple times a day). I'd only get a DM maybe every couple days \n Sometime in the late 2010s, things seemed to shift, where people just used Slack for all communications. So, in any given day, I'll get several DMs throughout the day or tags, and constantly have to divert attention from focusing on coding to respond or at least decide if it needs immediate attention. It's more difficult to focus, and I find sometimes I want to log off from Slack for several hours, even if that risks missing an actual important message.\n Anyway, what I'm saying is, make email popular again. Is it just me who's noticing this?\n EDIT: See a lot of suggestions to disable notifications, but I'm not sure it's feasible. Because there are infrequent occasions where something really is more urgent. I guess the issue isn't so much Slack vs email (Slack has its advantages), but rather there's no distinction in Slack on message priority.\n    submitted by    /u/forbidden-donut  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I do 1 on 1 with tech lead, they say to keep improving and work on smaller tickets. I feel like I may be laid off anytime and I'm surprised to have made it to this far as a dev\n    submitted by    /u/EitherAd5892  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been in software for just over 13 years, and I've noticed a dramatic change in how much I code. Here’s how much time I spent coding throughout my career and the general timeline of my software engineer life:\n  \n Time Frame in Career Title Time Coding \n  \n 0 to 1 year Graduate Soft Eng 75% \n  1 to 3 years Junior Soft Eng 75% \n  3 to 5 years Soft Eng 60% \n  5 to 8 years Senior Soft Eng 50% \n  8 to 13 years Lead Soft Eng 40% \n  13 to present Principal Soft Eng <5% \n \n For the most part I've been doing a lot of backend Python/AWS blah blah stuff. But with my new job I'm running several teams for 3 product lines that include front and back end. However the main issue is, as above, I do less than 5% coding per day. The rest is just solid meetings, fleshing out Jira tickets or architecture design stuff.\n I know it's a pointless metric to worry about but I can't help but get a slight bit of anxiety that I'm deskilling and losing the tricks of my trade that got me to where I am. Is this common for a jump like this? My initial Googling all points to wildly different answers, which I suspect will be voiced the same here. But some people, as Principal, say they code for upwards of 50% of the time per day.\n Am I paranoid about getting worried or is this the point of my career that I become Bill Lumbergh from Office Space and actually I'm now a \"manager\"?\n    submitted by    /u/TheRustyPilgrim  \n [link]   [comments]",

The best engineers are the ones that invest the most time into improving. Whether or not you 'love coding' is irrelevant. You can invest just as much time into something because you know you will make a lot of money in the end.\n Edit: Some people are misunderstanding what I am saying. Not being passionate does not mean hating what you do.

I am not going to feel guilt about taking a few months off from the process of sending out hundreds of applications per month with a 99.9% rejection rate, or at least not right now I’m not. I’m burned out from doing this for a year straight. If you suggest that I will fail in my career in CS because of this then you are seriously misunderstanding the sentiment of this post.

I had picked up a job back in march at a small insurance agency to develop a CRM lead management system for the company. The reason I picked up the job was to gain experience. I am the sole developer at my job and I am not going to lie I am gaining a lot of hands on experience primarily with Node.js, React, Azure, Git, REST APIs and a bunch of other things I cant remember to list. I report directly to the agency owner who is non technical, he likes my work and constantly tells me how smart I am but I feel as though he doesn't know what he is doing sometimes. He expects a single college student to build a CRM for his agency with no guidance from a senior engineer. I believe I am doing good work at this job and he thinks im pretty good too but I feel as though he is rushing me constantly asking me for updates on the project and setting deadlines for his employees to start using the CRM by this month. I have never had anyone use software written by me before so I am unsure of how this will pan out and I don't want to be responsible for such a big project in his business. Also I feel like for the amount of responsibility I have I shouldn't be getting paid 15 an hour and due to the fact that I am graduating soon I don't see myself staying here any much longer as 15 an hour wont cut it.

You might not care now, but you'll thank me in 10-15 years, especially if you plan to buy a house. Take care of your health - once you get older, medical costs become a significant cost no matter your insurance, and worse if you don't take care of yourself. \n Oh, you wanted career advice? Don't worry, that will come to you in time. Don't overthink it - it's a long road. Take care of yourself first. \n P.S.

I was initially hired as \"programmer\" and assumed I'd work in a team (which I mentioned during the interview), someone more senior, or at least someone else since they had 2 openings for the position.\n I couldn't be more wrong. Let's just say the team is basically non-existent and I was the only programmer in the company.\n While I could just give half assed work that barely works, I held myself to a higher standard and even go beyond sometimes. I set up a git repository with proper branches, proper documentation, make sure everything readable, proper security (last guy didn't even encrypt the passwords), did extra research and analysis whenever possible (I double majored in Statistics), etc. Within my first 90 days I've done everything from web apps to Android and native desktop apps from ground up.\n Both my supervisor and director were always pleased with my work and often praised me, though that means nothing if I had no one else to compare my work and performance to. They've been asking if I was interested in becoming a full time employee or at least a freelance since I was already familiar with the system. I'm thinking of taking the job and continue for a year to see if there's hope before finding a job elsewhere, so I'm planning to renegotiate the \"programmer\" title.\n TLDR: I think I've been responsible for more than what \"programmer\" would reflect in my resume.

It is quite error prone, and hallucinates often, and it looks like we may have reached a local maxima in terms of AI models (that is enthusiasm seems to have died down a bit).\n Cloud computing, though interesting in its own right, abstracts so many problems, and automates more work than AI. It only takes a few lines of code to create a dynamodb that can scale incredibly well with low latency. Same can be said about serverless, apis, and other services.\n It is incredible to me how abstracted the services are to the point that basic distributed system problems no longer require in depth knowledge (though you should probably still learn it). Same can be said with machine learning itself on an enterprise level. It is much easier to use Amazon Bedrock to create an LLM rather than learn the linear algebra behind the algorithms. The amount of code required is now reduced to just a few lines.\n For all of the attention that AI gets, cloud over abstracts and replaces a lot more work.\n EDIT: Seems like it is pretty clear now that this is a case of lower barrier to entry yields more productivity, thus more employees (thank you u/otherbranch-official) .

          "description": "Looking for insight into this. \n There seem to be two major classes of software devs in tech.\n  \nFAANG & former FAANG\n other\n  \nIn FAANG & former FAANG circles, we see people with TC $150K starting out, which then quickly grows to $300K and then tops out around $450K.\n In non-FAANG circles, it's more like $80K then $130k then $210k.\n I think a lot of the chaos and confusion in the market now is due to this.\n FAANG-class jobs have always been coveted, but now there is even more pressure.\n FAANG layoffs have FAANG staff all circulating and applying to the same small pool of companies which pay at FAANG levels. The cream of the crop are of course getting jobs at or above their previous TC, but \"middle of the pack\" staff aren't getting traction\n Non-FAANG are having a much harder time flipping from the \"other\" tech jobs into the \"FAANG & former FAANG\" pool since so many people already in those jobs are circulating & looking for them. \n FAANG and former FAANG may be taking paycuts and working the \"other\" jobs for a while, but I am pretty sure they would still be actively job hunting and working their networks to get a FAANG class job to get back their previous lifestyles.\n The overall effect is everyone is having trouble finding jobs that pay at or more than they were making before.\n So there is some impact on the non-FAANG markets as well. But predominantly what we have been seeing is FAANG-class job markets becoming extremely competitive, even when compared to how competitive they have always been, whereas the non-FAANG class jobs are somewhat more competitive but not nearly as much.\n If anyone has any research or thoughts on this I would love to see / hear it.\n    submitted by    /u/NormalUserThirty  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've worked my ass off the last few months and was even promised a bonus until I saw my next paycheck was unchanged, which is when I decided I'd only work as much as I was paid.\n Now I clock in at 9 and out at 5 and encouraged my team to do the same and of course we fell behind. My boss noticed this and today I was pulled into a meeting where they played good cop bad cop: one of them would criticise my decisions and act all panicked because we aren't meeting deadlines, and the other assured us it's fine and proposed solutions. They didn't threaten my position directly, but it all felt very threatening and dehumanising since the one that roasted me is my direct higher-up and since they literally only log in two days per week to ask me for progress as the rest of their tasks they dumped on me.\n I'm beyond furious and mentally checked out of this company and I'm thinking whether to quit this week. I have savings that would last me years if I maintained my current lifestyle. Ideally, I'd take a month or two off and then start applying to new jobs.\n Would quitting now be that huge of a mistake?

I got some great feedback on my resume, and I want to thank everyone who helped.\n Here's my update: - I updated my resume based on the suggestions from the post. Some advice was contradictory, so I chose what I thought was best. - I kept applying to only remote jobs. Even though some suggested trying onsite roles, I don't think I can go back to the in-office life. - I mostly got rejections, even with the updated resume, even when I met 100% of the requirements. I stopped counting the number of applicants. I carefully read each job description and only applied when I felt qualified, taking time to answer form questions and write cover letters. I started getting discouraged and applying less and less.\n  \nI realized I was too emotionally invested in this process, so I hired a VA on Upwork. I gave him a guide on what jobs to submit for (remote in NA, mentioning Python with 5+ years of experience), two versions of my resume, and a Google form to fill out after each application. This seems to be working better. He has applied for 500+ jobs so far, and I got 10 recruiter calls and 8 tech interviews set up. Six are US-based companies looking to hire Canadians, and two are early-stage Canadian startups. For four of the eight, I don’t even match the job requirements (different tech stack), but they still wanted to interview me 🤷‍♀️.\n  \nI have my first technical interview tomorrow—a live coding session (not LeetCode/Python).\n Any ideas on how to prepare?

The thing is, I've been exposed to security stuff more than the average software engineer, but in no way am I a security engineer or an expert in anything security. So I've been casually applying to new jobs just to test the waters and see what's out there, and I've set my LinkedIn to \"open to work\" (hidden, of course), and I'm surprised by the number of companies wanting to interview me... as a software security engineer. I am NOT qualified for any of those roles and have not used any of the tools listed, but they still want to chat. On the other hand, I've applied to a number of pure SWE roles and nothing but rejections. If you're a software engineer with a cybersecurity background, the market's probably hot for you.

I've run quite a number of coding interviews over the past couple of weeks. It's a pretty simple problem, requiring basic knowledge of how to use a dictionary/hashmap, with a few different steps along the way that build on one another. We offer it in your choice of any major language, but 99% of candidates pick Python. The test is completely open book and the interviewers provide coaching as well. \n My issue is that over the past couple of weeks, we've interviewed THREE different developers from Capital One, all Senior+ level, and all of them have very clearly had absolutely ZERO coding exposure. In 45 minutes, none of them could fulfill a single unit test, such as throwing an error if a parameter was None, or throwing an error if a value wasn't in the dictionary. All of them were performing below what I would expect from a first year CS student, yet 2 claimed to have Masters in CS. \n What the hell is going on? Is Capital One some kind of complete joke organization? Surely not, right? Are these people lying about working there? If so, why did all three have Capital One as their current employer? Is there some kind of conspiracy? Anyone else experienced this?\n    submitted by    /u/Mediocre_Fly7245  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm completely surprise by just how much of a gap the tech stacks are. I was always told that the private sector is efficient, leaner, and decades advance. Man I could not be more wrong. My old job did not use git (internal decades old version control that was a nightmare using between just two people), the senior developers insisted on using notepad ++ (complain whenever they saw me using vs code), and I just started learning React and Spring boot (seniors insisted in vanilla JS and in house low code backend language). My mind is blown. Whenever I ask this multi billion dollar company why, the responses I always got was that \"new\" tech is for over hype FAANG companies not \"real\" companies that make products. \n I had so many issues with how navigating the ancient tech stacks with no documentation that made me feel like an idiot. We would spend months building an application from scratch and custom developing everything and I got so many complaints whenever I pointed out a limitation that our products were doing that was solve decades ago with new stacks. I was told that if I ever went anywhere else they be even more behind and there no point learning these skills. My Team didn't even code. They were all engineers with decades of outdated experience that they even admitted are so behind they could not work with modern stacks and just waiting for retirement. I was the only engineer under 40 on my team and could not aks anyone for help because they didn't even understand html.

My question is, is there a way to quantify how many of those professionals are actually decent coders? Or, a more straightforward question would be how many don't really know how to code?\n I worked as a tutor for 3 years in college and as a \"professor\" for 2 years in a bootcamp, and I can safely say that a good chunk of my students and classmates oversell themselves on LinkedIn and Resume by a huge margin. \n They go from running a ML model from a repo to adding \"Successfully designed and implemented a Visual transformer model for semantic segmentation, obtaining 98% IoU score while training on a dataset with underrepresented classes\" on their resume. Like bro I know you don't know what those words mean, I was literally trying to teach them to you yesterday.\n I don't doubt that the market is bad compared to previous years, but I do wonder how much of that comes from people who just started trying to get jobs that demand more knowledge. That has to skew the unemployed rates in tech somehow.\n This is a legit question and I'd love to hear different or similar perspectives.\n    submitted by    /u/APEX_FD  \n [link]   [comments]",

Long story short, I was working at a startup until last Friday, when my boss and I suddenly had a one-on-one call over Zoom. The conversation was basically about me having to be more \"responsible\" in my job. In other words, reply to messages on the weekends, work overtime (with no pay), etc. In a nutshell, I apologized, politely said no, and that I was going to work strictly within the hours I'm meant to: 9 to 5. I was pretty much fired on the spot shortly after that.\n You see, ever since I'd gotten hired, I'd made my boundaries very clear and never failed to set them up. Once 5pm hits, I'm out. Nobody can contact me for work-related reasons. I don't care if something is broken or whatever, I'm not fixing it until the next day or the following Monday (if it's a Friday). Unless you communicate to me that you're going to pay me overtime, I'm out. I have things to do in my private life, like taking care of family and simply hunkering down so that I have the energy to get back at it the next day.\n I think that boundaries are very important, especially if they ultimately help you to love your job more and to be able to have good mental health. To expect and to demand from employees, especially to their face, that they're meant to sacrifice their life for the company they're working for is a huge red flag in my book.

I tried looking for examples online of legislation passed to penalize companies for outsourcing, but they are scant. \n  \nSenator Baldwin of Wisconsin Introducing the End Outsourcing Act - [Link]\n Although the act leaned more towards Manufacturing Jobs and Federal Spending to US Private Contractors that would turn around and outsource the costs of the service, there hasn't been much progress since 2021/2022 \n \nNo Tax Breaks for Outsourcing Act (2023) - [Link]\n Which mostly aimed at killing tax incentives for multinationals that shipped overseas. The approach here seems to rollback Trump-era tax breaks for corporations, and increase taxes on foreign profits therefore increasing local profits and disincentivizing outsourcing.\n \n ​\n All in all, the outsourcing problem seems complex and intertwined with very touchy facets of US commerce and labor, coupled with corporate desire for Short-Term profits. We cannot forget how the outsourcing plague in the mid-80s killed many American automotive manufacturing jobs and partly led to the demise of prosperous US Cities e.g. Detroit\n Do you think with the recent layoffs both in Tech and other fields that there is a likelihood that such legislation will be brought back up?

The following Monday I got an email from the startup that I was interviewing for that I have been selected for an internship. Even though I am looking for full-time I was a relieved a bit because I can have some more time to find fill time or even convert the above internship into full time since they did mention about the possibility of converting. I was getting responses from the CEO for my queries about the compensation, joining date, etc('will get back to you soon about it') but now he seems to have ghosted.\n Until now I have given 3 interviews including a FAANG only to get rejected in the final rounds. All my friends have a job they are moving away while I'm the only one left.\n I don't know what is wrong. The last company said I had many strong qualities but a few that they were looking for is missing. As an international student I only have two months i.e till August and I am worried a lot. \n I have been working so hard, day and night not being able to sleep so that I can give my all for the assignments and interviews only to be rejected.\n It hurts like hell and I feel so lost. Every time I don't get an offer letter after the final round I feel that I have lost everything and now I have to start from scratch. It is physically and mentally exhausting.\n Not only that but it hurts to see my parents work hard to provide me the money to stay here. I can't do it anymore. I don't know how to survive this.

          "description": "Hello,\n I am a recent CS grad. from a college in Chicago. The college is good, my GPA was about 3.81, and I graduated in December of 2023. Since then I have been applying to jobs left and right(1300+ jobs applied). However I have not been getting any interviews. I have a summer internship on my resume and have completed a few projects in IOS Development, ML and AI. I have also gotten accepted into OMSCS at Georgia Tech and will be starting in August.\n Since January I have been sitting at home-upskilling and applying to jobs. Now it has been 6 months and I have found no luck with my job applications. Therefore in order to payup my bills and student loan I have been searching for jobs nearby and got a shift leader position at Tacobell. Now even though I am not shy of working hard at a fast food place, I am feeling pity on myself as I did not get a job offer from my field. I feel like I am the problem and not skilled enough for the companies to hire me and I am worried about getting entry into the job market? I wanted to ask on this reddit community a few question:\n  \nShould I take the job at Tacobell and how should I be positive about it?\n Should I get more experience thought internships and coop? And do you have any good resources to find this internships/coops for Fall 2024.\n How can I improve my job application and get a better chance at landing an interview? Any certifications or any other skill that I should learn.\n What direction should I move forward with?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Brave_Indication_293  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello Reddit community,\n I'm a computer science student reaching out during a challenging time. I created a project, FlyMile pro, a flight search engine that finds flights on credit card points. Originally designed to enhance my resume and secure internships, it surprisingly attracted over 10,000 sign-ups!\n However, recently, I've been facing some distressing challenges. The CEO of PointsYeah has accused me of scraping their website, a claim that is entirely baseless (I have my GitHub commits, my code never interacted with his site). I hadn't even heard of PointsYeah until about a month ago, when I stumbled upon a mention in a Reddit post, Despite this, I received a message threatening to shut down my site (see message screenshot).\n Last night, our website was bombarded with an unusual amount of traffic, which seemed like a deliberate attack, and I've been receiving calls from random international numbers. I even found MilesLife - his previous company having payments issues with merchants - I will not comment anything on that, you are free to explore.\n I’m feeling quite overwhelmed by this, especially since this project was meant to be a positive addition to my learning and future opportunities. I've worked hard to create something useful and educational, not just for myself but for a broader community.\n Has anyone here experienced something similar? How did you handle it? Any advice on how to manage these accusations and protect my project?\n https://preview.redd.it/xwe6vmic7j5d1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=06f324a23cdd294172ace537a9d9003124e6d32e\n    submitted by    /u/Which_Extension_9576  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve had a few people look at my resume and I’ve incorporated their advice, but it hasn’t helped much. \n Tbh, I don’t know why I even try if recruiters don’t care about my GPA and experiences. I know my experiences can probably be a lot better, but i don’t know how to get a worthwhile experience if all my resume gets rejected. The only other reason i can think of is probably the fact that I’m on an F1 visa, and that I’m not very good at networking.\n I’m working to fix the latter over this summer but I wish that recruiters could put more weight on my existing experience and GPA, since right now it just feels like I’m trying extra for something pointless.\n    submitted by    /u/Orbital_RM  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been doing as much leetcode as I can as I before I finish off uni\n I asked around previous hires about the OA and what to prep, and they mentioned it was dom manipulation or what not but all I got was leetcode mediums and 1 hard. I managed to solve one and another one 14/15 test cases but last one did not have time to complete so it is half solved.\n Also I hate how RNG plays a part in these OA, I had a friend that told me his questions were like 1 LC medium and 2 LC easy, one was some simple string manipulation and another a simple hashmap solution both less than 20 lines while I got shafted rip, \n Pairing all this with the constant rejections from other companies, and the occasional reach final stage to only be rejected, it gets depressing every now and then.\n Just needed an outlet to rant, sorry to put more negativity into this thread. I will keep on grinding for sure and get better at my problem solving abilities and not give up of course and keep applying elsewhere, wishing everybody luck!!\n    submitted by    /u/Thepeebandit  \n [link]   [comments]",

After going through a particularly brutal experience (5 interviews + a take-home case study) and not hearing back, I decided to work on a tool that automatically tracks your applications, matches you with positions where you’re more likely to hear back and do well, and even predicts when you've been ghosted by a company (something I constantly experienced).\n https://preview.redd.it/tyo71u9a9u3d1.png?width=2846&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb24301ef065c714e28e3d97d2862d3ecf5f0a7c\n While the tool is still in development, it's helped a few people already, so I’m looking to get feedback from other CS students to make it even better. If you’re currently looking for internships (I'm currently working with a few startups looking for interns across business, design, and technology) and are interested in using the platform or providing feedback, please PM me and I’ll share the link. I really want to make finding internships easier for everyone, since I know how difficult and frustrating the application process can be, any feedback would be amazing.

The final interview went very well. The hiring manager (Very pleasant person) was very excited about me getting started ASAP because they were behind on a few projects and had a few more incoming. At the end of the interview, she assured me that they decided to hire me and to look out for the offer letter within a day or two. I was checking my email so often that I might have broken some record or two. The next day passed and no offer. The second day passed and no offer but now I am getting really nervous. On the third day, I get an email that they have decided to go with someone else.....\n I was crushed inside. This took all the wind out of me and now every time I fill out an application, my mood just drops when I remember this experience. \n About a week after that I called the recruiter (who was present in all interviews) and kindly asked for feedback and then asked her why they went with someone else after I was explicitly told that they chose me.\n Her answer..... \"The hiring manager wanted the other candidate because he had FiveTran experience....\"\n I could not believe it. Fivetran was never brought up in the interviews and it is insanely easy to learn.

I am not the person who went into CS only for the money or because it was trendy. I appreciate and am fascinated by technology, but it feels like the people I'm competing with live and breathe code, making it difficult for me to keep up since I don't enjoy coding all day or studying CS in general outside of classes.

They have me fixing bugs: there's a bug tracking system and I have access to the proprietary bug list, then I try to fix the code. It's super interesting. Obviously we don't make this public or use some open source tracker because there's a lot at stake even if it's just a simple thing like going over the speed limit once in a while. One time the system was turning on the windshield wipers in clear weather and turning them off in rain. We thought that was hilarious. \n So, we have this restricted area where there's a test track. We have to test the vehicles in a controlled environment very very thoroughly. A little while ago the test engineers became very stressed and agitated. We tried to find out why because they were mostly really smart nerds who left us alone. I was processing the bug list and I found a system video from a video where the test car ran over a kitty cat. I asked around and that was why the test engineers were so upset. It obviously wasn't their fault: after I studied the logs I figured out how a particular function misidentified the cat and failed to avoid it. The function had several logic errors in the way shapes and movement were processed. Now I have to decide what to do about it. I can fix it quietly, like I usually do. I could tell my boss or make an entry in the bug tracker that the function was programmed wrong. That could get back to the AI Vision Manager and she could be really mad. Someone could be fired over it. I don't want to make people mad at me. The bug is fixed. I think I should forget about it so I can have a good relationship with my coworkers and no one gets fired.

Just one day later, I received an email saying I got selected into an AI startup (which seems like a business) where they ask us to pay ~$30 a month to work in their AI labs and they would assign us some work and consider it as an intern opportunity.\n I am confused on what to do?

I feel like tech hiring isn’t really “bad”, of course it is compared to a few years ago, but for a job that (in the big places) pays way more than IB starting, cooler work, better culture and WLB, it’s only natural that it gets ultra competitive.\n It’s still possible to get tech jobs, it’s just really hard and you have to put in all the stops (just like I see my friends in IB doing), so target school, networking, interview prep, resume padding, the whole thing. \n I think the old times were a bit of a fever dream and now it’s just reality. Tech is still a great option but it (rightfully) is now really competitive just like IB is. I feel like the FAANG+ SWE life is a pretty great one, so it only makes sense that the process of getting it becomes more and more competitive \n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/Beginning_Act_1894  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For the NES PPU I'm confused on how the sprite pixels are combined with the background pixels during shifting/multiplexing to determine pixel color. The diagram here is... reasonably clear in showing how the background pixel is chosen via nametable/attribute fetches and scroll selection. But as far as I can tell it hand-waves exactly what the sprite pixel input is, simply listing [Sprites 0..7] as the input to the priority multiplexer. But what is that input?\n I've also read through Sprite Evaluation several times and I understand the relationship between OAM and secondary OAM; the latter holds the 8 sprites chosen for the upcoming scanline. But clearly it isn't the direct input into pixel selection because it's reset in the first 64 cycles of the current scanline. The details section lists that the secondary OAM data is \"fetched\" on cycles 257-320, but fetched to where?\n In javidx9's series he uses a shift register per scanline sprite (for 8 in total) which seems logical, it's essentially an extension of how background tiles work, but he seems to present this as the most straightforward way to do it in his emulator rather than a reflection of anything in the underlying hardware.\n The nesdev wiki doesn't seem to document what that sprite input is. Is this documented somewhere and I'm missing it?\n    submitted by    /u/drmonkeysee  \n [link]   [comments]",

As far as modeling the CPU, memory, and other system components, I've had little trouble thanks to to some system programming classes I've taken in the past. However, I'm at a roadblock when it comes to rendering the video output. I've tried a few different approaches, first trying SDL and then moving on to just using OpenGL libraries and I feel a bit lost. Does anyone have any good resources for getting OpenGL or SDL working for someone with no background in graphics programming? I would even be open to other approaches but preferably staying in C++ and something that could also be used in later projects.\n PS: I am currently just developing in a Windows 10 environment\n    submitted by    /u/Maras59_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then the game loads as usual. \n IE: 0b0000'0001 | IF: 0b000'0001\n JOYP [FF00]: 0b1111'1111\n \n I press the mapped \"Start\" button: \n IE: 0b0000'0001 | IF: 0b0001'0000\n JOYP [FF00]: 0b1101'0111\n \n I release the mapped \"Start\" button: \n IE: 0b0000'0001 | IF: 0b0001'0000\n JOYP [FF00]: 0b1111'1111\n \n  \nAnd nothing happens. IE never becomes 0b0001'0001 in order to enable the interrupt. One source I read claims that that most games do not use this interrupt for joypad inputs.\n Interestingly, if I keep pressing \"Start\", at some point, the game registers that it has been pressed, and the screen advances. I have done the same with the other buttons, where the game loads, and I will, for example, press \"Left Arrow\" and the character will move, after like 50 button presses.\n Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated!

I'm not sure what exactly the expected behavior is supposed to be.\n I've seen multiple sources say that, after enabling the LCD, the very first scanline on the first frame has different timings from other scanlines, but I can't find timing documentation for this anywhere.\n Here's what I've gathered so far:\n  \nThe PPU starts in mode 0 (HBlank) after the LCD is enabled. There is no mode 2 on the first scanline.\n After mode 0, PPU advances to mode 3, which is unusual.\n The PPU advances from mode 3 to mode 0, and remains in this mode until the end of the scanline.\n After scanline 0, the PPU resumes normal operation (mode 2, mode 3, mode 0, etc)\n The PPU starts 2 t-cycles \"late\"?\n The LCD is blank for the first frame after it is enabled\n  \nWhat is the timing for scanline 0? How long does the PPU stay in each mode?\n Are any interrupts requested during the first frame after enabling the LCD?\n How is the PPU started 2 cycles \"late\" if it starts in mode 0 and jumps straight to mode 3? How can it be late if it starts in HBlank?\n Is there any documentation out there that describes this behavior?\n I had a look at Higan, and it runs mode 0 for 72 clocks, then mode 3 for 172 clocks (according to Kevtris this might need to be 173.5), then back to mode 0 until 456 clocks have elapsed.

It's also worth mentioning before people tell me to get a computer, I have a decent gaming computer I just for the life of me cannot figure out what I'm doing with retroarch or it's settings: PS2 games refuse to even load and causes a retroarch crash, GameCube games stutter so hard I feel like I did a half ounce of mushrooms. Thank you for any helpful information, I'm going to attach a link to the emulator system I was previously talking about.

          "description": "Load balancers, historically meant one thing: a hardware or a software component that simply handles balancing the load among different servers in a distributed architecture. Today, the meaning completely changed. The different cloud providers have 4 or 5 different load balancer implementations which are all used for different purposes such as TCP connection balancing, HTTP/s balancing, TLS termination, something called Gateway balancing, etc. etc. Isn't the term overloaded? For example, I don't even understand how we came to a definition that a load balancer must be able to do TLS termination. It just does not make sense when you simply think about the definition. \n So, here is my question; if a new cloud provider popped up today and made an announcement \"X Cloud now has Cloud Load Balancer\", what do you expect them to have? What are the must haves of a load balancer? Would a simple Layer 4 load balancer suffice or everyone needs that Application Load Balancer for path based load balancing, Let's Encrypt integration, DDoS protection, etc.? \n    submitted by    /u/furkansahin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Recently, I received an offer to work as a DevOps engineer at a large corporation that heavily uses Jenkins.\n The reason they are hiring me, someone with a mixed career of development and CI/CD experience, instead of a DevOps expert, is probably because their Groovy scripts have become very large and complex, necessitating a dedicated software engineer to refactor/manage them. My main responsibilities would be developing and maintaining Jenkins pipelines for on-prem legacy systems, which would account for about 60-70% of my work, with the remainder involving DevOps tool development using Python and shell scripts, and cloud infra automation tasks as some of their services are running on the cloud. I feel that if I stay here for 3-4 years, I might find it difficult to come back to a developer or work on anything other than managing legacy Jenkins tasks, yet the salary is 30% higher than my current one, which makes the decision challenging. TBH, I don't have extensive experience in managing Jenkins, so I'm not sure if the job is going to be terrible or surprisingly manageable..\n Would you take a 30% salary increase to manage legacy Jenkins systems?

I applied to a senior DevOps role at one company, and did 3 interviews, very easy interviews I should add. Today I received an offer from that company, and noticed that they changed the role in the offer to lead DevOps engineer. I asked about this, since I thought it was a mistake, and was told that their senior role is for people with around 5 years experience, and since I have 7 years, it would need to be upgraded. \n This seems a bit weird to me, even though I was assured it's not a management position and still very much technical and hands on. I'm kind of unsure about this, as it feels like it could be something I don't want and could be a trap. The company is 11,000+ employees, and I'm more used to working in startups and mid-sized companies.\n I should note also that I haven't ever had the official title of senior DevOps engineer. In fact it was a point of contention in my old company, as my previous boss would often tell me why I'm not a senior and would try to ridicule me in meetings. This kind of broke my confidence, and was probably why he chose me to be laid off first. \n I'm unsure what to do here, as it's not something I've experienced before.

I wanted to ask some insights on how to deal with people who don't really know the real role of a DevOps engineer. \n So our Dev lead in our team thinks that the role of DevOps is to just take care of the deployment of our services, scan vulnerabilities and that's it. I created some processes to improve the config management of our app services but they are not really following it for some reason. I also added some status checks on our repos to improve the code quality that devs are adding on to our app but I keep on getting complains as to why they need to wait for those checks to finish everytime they have a PR. Our Dev lead keeps on insisting that we should keep our responsibilities only for deployment and not care about the code(in terms of quality and vulnerabilities) they are adding on to the repo. It's slowly getting toxic already. I keep on thinking about ways to improve the CICD process of the team but they keep on ignoring the process. I even do KT sessions to the team and ask whether they have some opinions on the process but thats just it, they attend the session and then go back to their old ways right after \n It's so frustrating already.

          "description": "I have been struggling to wrap my head around our application sets and helm charts for a year now. My boss wrote them from scratch and what we do every time we have a new microservices or app is copy the last one and modify it. So far so good… However we have a very complex and flexible hierarchy of values, templates, and stuff that I don’t even know if they’re normal terms — trigger files and seed files, which a python script takes as inputs to generate the app set.\n We have a multi-tenant architecture in regions all over the world in both AWS and Azure, and of course many environments, including the standard dev/qa/prod as well as cloud vs on-prem, so this is part of the reason for the open-ended nature of the way he designed things. It feels like a very loose (undocumented) framework that requires complete knowledge in. It’s pure gitops which I love, but often I find myself staring at a yaml and wondering what something does, how it fits in, and if it’s overridden somewhere else. I spend a lot of time recursive grepping, looking at Argo overrides (I hate the tag bubble format), and in general wasting time. \n In a way this reminds me of Puppet hiera, but obviously more complex. The fix for that was Foreman with the UI that had taxonomy and inheritance. Is there anything like that for helm values? Is there any automation tool or popular framework that creates standardized app sets? (And helm charts?) Again the parallel would be something like creating an rpm from scratch vs having a polished script or tool like fpm to standardize the process. I’d love to have a Wizard-like tool guide me through the process. “Does your app need to talk to kube-API? No? Then you don’t need a dedicated service account. Let’s delete that from the chart so it doesn’t blow up when you don’t set values for it.” Etc. \n I’m a smart guy but this really feels like the Wild West out here. \n    submitted by    /u/shulemaker  \n [link]   [comments]",

Public cloud isn't an option for compliance reasons.\n The team I've just joined is wrangling about the container solution for the new platform. The user traffic they get is not that big. It is certain to increase as they scale up, although I couldn't say how much exactly. It doesn't feel like the stack is complex enough to go to K8s just yet. If it was AWS I would probably be pushing for ECS, because it's a good choice for small-to-medium scale workloads, it can go quite a long way before needing to migrate to K8S, and it's pretty straightforward to get going with.\n But this is the on-prem world which is all new to me. I'm not sure what ECS equivalents there are, or whether there even are any and maybe it's normal to just go to K8s. Plus I'm aware that thinking of 'equivalents' is perhaps not the right way to approach things, but it is just new territory that I'm trying navigate. They currently use Docker Swarm. I don't know much about it but some people I've spoken to have been quite derisive of it.\n Any input?

          "description": "I work at a company that tends to have an \"all hands on deck\" incident culture, very similar to this post from r/sysadmin. My team owns an application networking infrastructure platform that has internal developer teams as our customers.\n We have built our platform to be almost completely self-service to developer teams, including providing telemetry tools (logs, metrics, traces) that developers can use to troubleshoot problems that pass through our platform.\n However, our team has noticed a pattern during incidents where a developer team and/or their leadership will pull our team into incident troubleshooting meetings if our platform is involved at all in the impacted business/application flow (ex: Client -> Platform 1 -> App 1 -> Our platform -> App 2).\n As a result of this, our team has become more efficient on ruling out our platform from the problem (using the same self service telemetry tools mentioned before). For 95+% of incidents, our platform is not the problem and it ends up being an issue with another developer teams application. This efficiency has saved us a lot of time and avoided blame for incidents, but the constant pull for our team still adds up and results in a lot of wasted time on these incident meetings.\n From a business perspective, leadership wants us involved whenever possible to reduce business impact and MTTD/MTTR. We are struggling to find a way to change the organizational culture where developers will use our self service tools to troubleshoot incidents rather than relying on us to interpret the telemetry for them.\n Have you all had similar experiences at your companies as platform owners? If so, how did you improve this culture so that your team reduces toil and gets more time to work on platform improvements/features?\n    submitted by    /u/vinnishi  \n [link]   [comments]",

Both WireGuard and OpenVPN, even manual setup. I used to say that they wouldn't do it, because many businesses depend on private VPNs and it would break too much, but they seem to be doing it successfully. I had my job VPN working without issues the whole time. I was able to find some less known services in GooglePlay, but it was tricky.\n Are they just banning IPs or there is something else? What if I set up my own VPN service and use it alone, is there a high chance that it may be banned too?\n    submitted by    /u/Organic-Maybe-5184  \n [link]   [comments]",

So for example if there is some element in html having src=\"path/style.css\" browser will try to download from www.foo.bar/path/style.css and not www.foo.bar/grafana/path/style.css. This will obviously fail as nginx won't know what to do with this request.\n This can be dealt with using \"sub_filter\" directive (with some pain) so it's not that bad. However, the next problem is much worse. \n \nRedirects\n The problem is very similar to the previous one. When I go to the grafana index page it redirects me to /login path. The issue is that it will take me to www.foo.bar/login and not www.foo.bar/grafana/login. I haven't found any way of dealing with this and it's preventing me from proceeding. Grafana is kind enough to give you root_url config which is made for situations like these, but rabbitmq or kafka-ui and other services simply don't. \n \n Anyone has any experience with stuff like this? \n    submitted by    /u/Present_You_5294  \n [link]   [comments]",

But for DevOps some of these requirements are insane. The active secret clearance is what gets me. How are you supposed to have an active TS clearance if the company won’t sponsor you? Also clearances are EXPENSIVE, if you have one, why would you be jumping ship to another job??\n 8+ years of exp required Must have bachelors with 4 years exp.\n I’m only at an associates with a year and a half of DevOps experience.\n My tech stack is Azure, K8s, PostgreSQL DB, Terraform, Azure Bicep, Debian, Ubuntu, Python, Docker, YAML, some node.js.\n Kinda stuck here. What do I do?\n I’ve got an AZ-900, studying up for the AZ-104. But even if I had AZ-104 I don’t think I’d have much better luck. \n    submitted by    /u/blueplutomonk  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got a lot of support and help realizing that where I worked wasn't the norm from this sub.\n I was able to force through a lot of changes that, while they didn't solve the root of the issue, made things less unbearable. At least enough to keep me from rage quitting while I kept looking.\n And now, after several months of looking, I found a new role. Fully remote. Working for a university. First engineer onboarded for standing up a new, really cool project. This means I get to actually build something from scratch with no technical debt from legacy systems and bureaucracies. I get more vacation/paid holidays. And I've already met some brilliant people that I would have otherwise never encountered. \n I'm still serving my 2 weeks at the old job, but I've basically already handed everything off. Might just take half days until my last day. Been spending the rest of my time writing out the architecture diagrams of how I want to build my dream serverless environment. IAC, automations, and pipelines everywhere. \n And now I can just get dogs for the house and pet them while getting paid.

I used to love this, but now its.. another day, another feature implemented, wow we implemented argo instead of deploying via pipeline, I mean who give a f#uck, I certainly don't.

Both have 10+ YOE. One was hired at a managerial level, one as a Senior (though not staff) Engineer.\n Both have, frankly, struggled. I'm not a typical Junior (had 20+ years of experience in management outside of Tech before moving into an IC role), so even though I've still got a lot to learn about IT, the director and VP have come to me about people management issues, and I keep suggesting caution and patience.\n Every DevOps Engineer that I've seen start with us, it takes about 6 months to get to a level of proficiency where you can start producing individually across the organization. I think that Seniors (and Managers) get a lot shorter of a leash when it comes to this kind of thing - they have higher expectations to 'hit the ground running.' But my experience is that they do not 'ramp' any quicker, and may in fact ramp up more slowly.\n I don't think this is an ageist thing on my part (again: am old), and our most productive DevOps by FAR is a guy who is a 'Super Senior' - he's staff level, has been here for 10+ years, and is a master. But again - he's been here for ten years.\n I was reading a book where a physicist decries that he's 'too old' at 30 to make any major discoveries, and the paradigm of an athlete (where you're cooked after 10-15 years professionally) fit a little too well onto the DevOps Engineers I know.\n TL;DR - Do DevOps's have an expiration date? Is it harder to join a new team when you're more experienced?

My company are transitioning from a monolithic architecture to breaking this up into microservices for future scaling and deployment of individual components. \n We already have broken a few services out of the monolith into independant microservices, but there are now plans to do all. Docker was OK to manage 5 microservices or so but will be eventually running 20+ so moving to k8s makes sense. \n I have a bit of previous k8s experience, but when it comes to moving a monolith architecture to separate services, I am wondering what the best approach is. Is the best route to break up the monolith and after everything is running as its own docker container, port this to k8s, or is it better to transition the current microservices to k8s and the break up the monolith and add to the kubernetes cluster as I go? \n I ask because both routes involve a lot of work, and anyone with a bit of experience of doing something similar in the past can share any knowledge or do's/don'ts when approaching this.

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I'm investigating how to set up integration tests in our project, we do not have any tests in place at the moment. We are using NodeJS/NestJS on the backend side, and everything is deployed as AWS lambdas using a serverless framework. We use Postgres SQL database.\n What I've discovered so far is that there are a couple of ways how can you implement integration tests but there are still some uncertainties.\n First option: Running integration tests during CI/CD\n  \nThe issue here is that our build already takes ~10-15-20 minutes. So it would additionally slow it down even more. Also, we would need to spawn a new environment (not all services, part of the services that are needed for integration tests, database, etc.) before the PR gets merged (since you can not run integration tests with new code since the code is not yet deployed). The issue with spawning environments is the serverless framework which does not have an option to do it in regular way (at least I haven't found it). For these purposes, we could use Terraform or AWS SAM but it takes time to switch to these IAAC tools and we need to start using integration tests as soon as possible.\n  \nSecond option: Running integration tests nightly\n  \nThis looks like a better option to me personally since we would use the existing test environment and every night with deployed code we would run integration tests and fix them tomorrow. The downside is that the code that does not work might be deployed anyway, but I don't see an issue with it since we have weekly releases and once code is deployed to a specific environment we leave it there for ~7 days.\n  \nI would appreciate your opinion or advice on which practices to implement and apply and if you think that my favorite option (second option) is not the best approach here.\n Also, I assume for NodeJS/NestJS we should just Jest testing framework?\n    submitted by    /u/vidara15  \n [link]   [comments]",

Combined with enough workers this gets test suite run times down to seconds (https://brisktest.com/demos).\n I've had a lot of requests for people who want to run Brisk in their own infrastructure and so I've gone ahead and open sourced it all. You can now run Brisk yourself both locally (for development/testing purposes) and in your own cloud for free.\n Currently we have dedicated support for Node JS, Ruby, Python and Go test suites and we integrate with Github Actions, CircleCI etc, Bitbucket etc. Adding additional test runners for other languages is also straightforward. \n We also integrate with your IDE so you can access the full power of your CICD pipeline from your local machine after each save. \n Let me know what you think.\n https://github.com/brisktest/brisk\n https://docs.brisktest.com/\n    submitted by    /u/reillyse  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been studying for the CKA cert, however after thinking about it some more, CKAD is starting to make more sense to me.\n The continuous trend in k8s administration is through managed services like EKS and GKE. Rarely do I see job openings of bare metal or administrating a cluster through other means. While yes there are still cases where you need to debug the control plane, it's extremely rare and 99% of the time, the associated cloud provider has support. \n And yes, it's extremely important to know how the control plane component works. But, I find that my personal experience with K8s is more in the development and application architectural side, than it is in debugging etcd or the api server.\n Does anyone else feel the same?

          "description": "Disclaimer: not a Red-Hat employee nor an OCI foundation member.\n TL;DR: Skopeo is great for Air-Gapped Container Registry syncs and image management.\n I am currently working in the Industrial IoT sector where a lot of Cloud-Native products are seeping in. The only issue is customers of Operations Technology despise Internet Connectivity. Without Internet Connectivity, working with Cloud-Native technologies like Containers is a massive pain.\n So as a common way to solve such a problem I was working with Ansible to setup systems with a Docker Registry and then using container tarballs to do the following:\n  \ndocker pull images from registries\n docker save to create tarballs\n docker load to extract them on the main gateway\n docker tag to make sure I rename it for making it compliant with the registry\n docker push to registry\n cleanup etc.\n  \nThis works well for a single architecture system e.g. amd64. Now I have devices which also are arm64 based and the registry isn't smart enough to generate manifests to let devices determine which blobs to pull based on the underlying architecture.\n I tried Skopeo today and in the lab I was able to sync an Image from Docker Hub to a testing registry in 10s.. No docker gymnastics involved.\n If i need to create tarballs - Skopeo can do that. If I need to push tarballs to a registry it can do that too. Cherry on Top, no need to have docker installed on your local machine where some development is needed.\n I will combine Ansible and Skopeo to get a large leap on the product I am working on.\n The only thing I need to figure out is to generate a Manifest List for multi-arch container images available on Docker Hub\n Amazing tool, would recommend for air-gapped scenarios.\n    submitted by    /u/dugindeep  \n [link]   [comments]",

How bad is it really to run the Application without the agent, and just push with the SDK?\n Q: Is the push model much worse than the pull model?

The service discovery for pull seems like just another thing to deal with.\n Collector - Can be configured to pull metrics , can it pull logs and traces too?\n Q.

Recently I have been maintaining a quite seasoned system that has been migrated to new versions, from JSF to REST + Angular, features have been replaced by different ones many times, etc. There is a lot of dead code that isnt used anymore, and sometimes slows down new implementations, so I started to slowly delete it as I was certain.\n Although I am 100% sure that I should be deleting the code in my situation and this effort will pay off, I started thinking that if I were the one that made those changes this wouldnt be so obvious.\n So, what do you think about this?

We are part of a medium-sized engineering department with 400 people.\n Everything was perfect when we started as a small team of 8 building the app. We produced high-quality code with very few bugs. Last year, my team doubled in size to 15 people. Now, we are more prone to bugs and errors, partly due to the hiring of some inexperienced developers.\n Earlier this year, we launched the app and it was a great success.

However, these inexperienced developers are committing atrocious code. It only slows us down and increases the number of bugs. Just today, I was browsing our app and landed on a page I worked on a month ago. The page has become unusable because a React developer \"worked\" on it, introducing numerous anti-patterns.\n I'm not even sure what we are working on anymore. I keep finding pages and features that we weren't made aware of.\n You might argue that our PR process should improve, but it’s impossible to review every PR when 7 other teams are committing their code to the mobile codebase.

We have this project that is a secondary initiative (we get about 10% we get about 10% of time to work on it) where they got together some people from different teams to form a group that would work on a new initiative. Right now, the team has about 10 people assigned to it. But between architects, 2 managers from different teams, a scrum master, two eng from a stakeholder team that are there in an advising role, and a staff eng that says is too busy to do technical work. We are literally 3 people working and 7 people watching.\n Obviously the project is going extremely slow, so some questions are being asked constantly about what are the blockers and how many hours are being dedicated to it.\n It is an interesting project on a hot topic that I want to get more experience on (you can easily guess the topic, although I won’t confirm it since I don’t want to give too much away). So I’m not interested on stepping away from it but at the same time the fact that 70% of the team is just watching is slowly getting to me\n Edit: my question is how to approach this to make it a successful project. Should we advocate to trade some of these people for working hands? Should we leave it as it is but set expectations that this will be slow?\n    submitted by    /u/arena_one  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I want to get people’s opinion on this. I have dealt with hands off managers who may still be technical. I have also dealt with hands on managers who jump in and write a lot of code themselves. I will say that in almost every case where managers are writing code it’s pretty much a disaster.\n Now there are cases where teams are tiny, only consisting of maybe 3 members and a lot of work. So managers may have no choice but to write code. In some startup situations it makes sense. But it should be looked at as temporary and not something permanent.\n I have found managers who write code tend to get requirements and not share them with the team. Building things in secret. Or they just don’t allow the team to do any interesting work, only leaving them scraps to work with. They can also just push their code across in code reviews because they are the boss. And even if they allow their code to be reviewed they can just ignore comments and bypass all the checks or coerce reviewers to approve their code anyway. Also they can just push their code across and it doesn’t have to be QA’ed.\n I have ran into this. Where our manager created a caching layer due to an optimization roadmap. We have no clue he had been working on this service. And it was kind of an agreement he had between himself and my VP. They both agreed he should work on it because they needed to get this deliver quickly and the normal process would be cumbersome. This was launched in prod. Disaster struck. Due to a threading issue customers were seeing other customer account info. This was a phased deployment so the impact was only 1% in a specific region. But this should have never made it to production at all.\n I have also found managers who code don’t develop good teams. Again they hog up all the interesting work. Refuse to share their knowledge or let anyone work on things they are working on. And it just feels toxic to me. \n But what are you opinions? Any scenarios that may contradict my opinions?\n    submitted by    /u/branh0913  \n [link]   [comments]",

This thing handles pricing info for my company and is cobbled together with VB, old .NET, and massive stored procedures. There’s zero automated tests or documentation. Just a couple of senior folks who have the tribal knowledge to keep this beast on life support.\n Here’s the kicker: one of them is always drowning in their own dev work, and the other is perpetually trapped in meetings. These are my go-to people for keeping things running, but getting help is like pulling teeth.\n Some of the “simple” changes they ask me to make are nightmares because I’m wading through ancient tech with no map. Plus, every time I ask questions, I get responses that feel more like bullying than guidance. It’s always “I’m right, you’re wrong, just do it my way so I can get back to my meeting.”\n I hate being bullied in meetings and during tasks. I’m trying to be thorough, but I’m terrified of breaking something in production because I don’t fully understand this dinosaur of a system. We’re supposed to sunset this app next year, but I don’t want to be stuck on this team that long. I’m already scoping out the job market, but it’s looking pretty grim out there.\n Any advice? How do I deal with the bullying and the stress of maintaining this relic? Anyone else stuck in a similar situation?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/bentheprogrammer  \n [link]   [comments]",

IME, there’s no shortage of work that needs to be done. I have been looking for two months and have not had a single interview. A friend, who is a very strong dev, told me that 3 devs he currently works with have been looking for other jobs for 6-9 months and they’ve found nothing, and he says they’re good. He believes that employers know this, and are using it to squeeze more work out of people. Every employed developer I’ve talked to is overworked and stressed out. \n What is going on? This is not normal. I have a couple of theories, but when I hear myself explaining them, I sound like a crackpot.\n  \nEmployers are frustrated at developers refusing to return to the office and are applying pressure\n With a polarizing presidential election this year, companies are reluctant to make long term plans and commit to budgets when the business environment could be drastically different, come January, depending on the winner\n Employers are creating artificial job scarcity in order to influence the outcome of the election \n  \nThis is not a political post, please don’t flame me.

I can't really delegate to anyone because all of the capable engineers left my team since they're sick of working with me. The junior engineers regularly message my manager because I can't fix their problems and it's hurting their ticket completion rates. I've received scathing rebukes from colleagues calling me lazy and unqualified ever since college, even though I did the work and graduated with a master's in CS from a state school with a 3.7 GPA.\n The final nail in the coffin was when I was rebuked by a colleague today for not completing an extensive performance test, which is a criteria for releasing a much-needed feature. I had a lot of higher priorities including company-wide shipblockers to fix, yet millions of dollars are on the line. In my opinion releasing a slow feature is the best we can do at this point anyways, but that's not enough.\n The fact is that I will emerge into a job market with NO references, and the company will report me as No Rehire when prospective employers do reference checks. It's the only job I've had since college.\n I'm not looking for validation, and I've been working on my flaws. Yet when expectations go up faster than I can fix my flaws, it's frankly time to go.

This distant relationship is quite different from my previous experiences where I had open and frequent communication with my bosses.\n I've also noticed that the majority of my team members are Desi India, which makes me wonder if the lack of communication could be attributed to cultural differences. I stated this because I had a manager who was Desi India at my last company for month and he never attend stand up and left everything to the tech lead before he was replaced replace.\n Despite expressing my concerns during a 1-1 meeting with my tech lead after three months on the job, little has changed. While I was reassured that I was doing a good job, it's difficult for me to understand how that assessment is made when there's minimal interaction or feedback. Additionally, I've observed discrepancies in the level of support provided to different team members, which is concerning and leads me to question my role within the team.\n When I participate in stand-ups or lead meetings, it often feels like my contributions are overlooked or ignored.

He is getting alot of credit for my work as well as the core infrastructure still runs on my code, but the rest of the team seems to have forgotten about it. The only reason he could refactor anything is because I solved the technical challenges first.

He has superb communication skills, so despite the size of his contributions, he always manages to get recognition from stake-holders, this wasn't the culture of my previous team, on which we were low profile and respected the ownership and expertise of other members.\n This new culture has become a bit uncomfortable as I'm not used to fight my way to lead the few projects available. One reason for this zero-sum battle with senior eng is that eng manager hasn't been that involved in team ops for months, skipping many stand-ups and 1-1s, but this hasn't caused noise to skip-manager & PM, as the team delivers anyways on those few projects.\n Part of me says that I should be happy with the light work load I'm getting here & be more focused in up-skilling while I can. But other can't get over the dread against senior eng getting all the flashlights.\n Have you been in a similar situation before?

Looking back, I think this might be because I wasn't as strong in answering random coding trivia questions during interviews.\n However, I'm finally happy to be in a position that involves more technical work. It's primarily focused on simple scripting and (linux/cloud) system administration tasks. While these are valuable skills, I still feel a strong desire to be more deeply involved in the technical aspects of software development (or cybersecurity if there is a decent amount of coding involved).\n So, my question is: Is it normal to crave a more technical role, even after several years in the workforce? Does my experience so far sound like a waste of time, or can the skills I've gained be applied to more technical positions?\n Adding on to this, what I'm noticing is that when I do apply to more technical roles now (although not a crazy amount), I seem to be getting rejected with no interview, which is what scares me. I know the job market is bad, and I'm concerned I may be stuck in my current role longer than I should be.\n    submitted by    /u/ggPassion  \n [link]   [comments]",

I noticed that half of the people left during his part as he was yapping.\n I think one reason for this is his lack of understanding of the topic he is presenting, thus he is using a lot of filler words and buzzwords just to keep talking. I actually emphasise with that as I sometimes do that if i am not confident in what I am presenting, but not to that extent.\n Yapping also happens often during client calls when he needs to explain his work. It is evident that clients get confused, but everyone is polite and just lets him talk.\n Have you had experience with dealing with people like this. How do you provide feedback so it doesn’t sound accusatory. I don’t feel comfortable with providing feedback out of the blue as he doesn’t report to me. Perhaps I shouldn’t care about it in the first place, but I do find this behaviour irritating \n In the next feedback cycle I will write a feedback saying that this person would benefit from learning how to be more concise in the meetings. A good approach would be to record a demo and watch it back and answer the question “if I was watching this demo on youtube for learning purposes, would I find it engaging”.

They also hired another mediocre developer instead of me.\n Now the problem is since I am not working anymore the velocity of the team dropped so much since on top of I was doing my work I was also handling unforseen/bullshit tasks for everyone so other developers can only focus on their work. But now I don’t have time at all between two projects to babysit all developers, but if I won’t no work is being completed, if I do babysit then I need to overwork. Velocity dropped more than half with same amount of developers and it is going like that for months.\n Scrum master is telling it is not your problem, but if things go like that there is a chance that projects may be cancelled and my career will be ruined. \n What is your suggestion? Should I just give up and try to get back into development position? Or is there any way to solve this problem?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/shokkul  \n [link]   [comments]",

The resulting service classes each end up updating the service's data store, so I'm inclined to keep them in this same repo.\n Should I push for there be multiple deployments (one for HTTP, one for gRPC, one for message queue consumption) such that they can scale independently?

A 15YOE replacement was hired and it was immediately obvious they could only deliver at a junior level. I advised the manager to get rid of them before their probation period was up. They wanted to give them a chance to improve, which hasn’t come to fruition.

Interacting with the business, being the sole senior engineer, handling a lot of the devops work since it’s moderately complex and a fresh grad is way over their head here. I’d hoped the mid level would rise up but it’s becoming clear that mid level could potentially be their peak. Struggling to keep the lights on let alone have time to grow the other members. Recent feedback from the engineers is that they need cards to have more detail for implementation (which is part of my role) so I feel like I am struggling to perform my core responsibility.\n Recent restructuring has brought in a new manager who asked if I want to go back to being an IC.

          "description": "Infrastructure-as-code is nice, but what are the best approaches to perform tests (unit, integration, regression) tests on this code? Let's say you have a reasonably complex mix of AWS Cloudformation, some Ansible, and a few random scripts. The entire infra may consist of a few DBs and servers, some Lambdas, various event sources, etc. Nothing even too outrageous and complex.\n What's the best way to test your code (Ansible playbooks, Cloudformation templates, scripts) for correctness?\n There is, of course, always the nuclear option: Have a separate test/dev account, spin it all up there, and then perform end-to-end testing with artificial clients (for example). Also, test that an existing system (old version) can be upgraded with the latest version of your infra-code.\n But those deployments can take a long time. And unless each developer has their own account for experimentation, you need to deal with the test/dev account being a bottleneck, etc.\n So, aside from that, what are some other approaches or strategies that you have found to be useful? \n    submitted by    /u/ernbeld  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are some obvious blunders that at some point all developers learn as mantras like \"global variables are bad\", \"eval is evil\" (jokingly), etc. Lame examples, I know, but the idea is that there are some obvious fallacies like N+1 queries that any experienced developer learns to deal with. \n However, there are some trickier ones that even more or less experienced devs either don't pay enough attention to or just are not aware of. One somewhat unexpected example is that some even pretty experienced (at least nominally) devs don't really understand how indexes work in Postgres/mysql. Some don't even really understand JOINs apart from the inner one. \n My personal source of shame is how I used deployed a service that repeatedly executes fat queries in BQ, but didn't really introduce any retries, backoffs and alerting.

Simple feature work is hamstrung by the hell I have to go through to get anything working locally, which is infuriating because by the time I have a testing env setup stuff is usually trivial. Anyone here gone through anything similar? 8YOE, this is clunkiest setup I’ve ever had to deal with \n EDIT: clearing up a misconception I’m seeing — there are not 350 microservices, there are 350 pods. Some services have different pods, ie DBs etc etc. there are probably around 50 different services.

          "description": "Ever since AI has hit the scene, we have been having issues where developers blame mistakes they are making on the AI generating the wrong code.\n I have people saying \"oh well chatgpt generated it wrong\" when a bug reaches prod instead of being accountable to their own work. And they can't debug their own work because they don't understand how it works either, so I have to troubleshoot it as well.\n Another issue I have is during code reviews, people cannot explain why they wrote their code a certain way. They just say \"that's what chatgpt output\". And it's usually just several long functions with minimal thought going into the design or how it will work in the bigger picture. One project is using 3 or 4 different libraries for making http requests at this point because chatgpt isn't consistent in which it uses and devs arent checking to see what is already in place. \n The other thing people started doing is responding with a copy paste from chatgpt explaining the design when answering my PR comments. Even if the explanation feels nonsensical from my perspective, they just copy paste spam clearly generated replies until I give up and pass the review over to someone else.\n Ive talked to my boss but hes drunk on AI hype and thinks this is the future. I explain these issues but he thinks I am just trying to force people into doing things the old way. His favorite thing to say is that people originally opposed using compilers and wanted to hand write assembly for a long time, which i find pretty annoying. How can I get people to start using their brains again and stop abusing this program? I feel like I am going crazy.\n    submitted by    /u/CooperNettees  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hopefully, based on the upvotes, this is fine :) \n I have finally read all the responses in that thread about the tips for writing better code. A lot of people mentioned testing, but the opinions themselves were really different. \n My recent project proved to me that unit tests are very tricky to get right. It's very simple to write them and increase the coveted code coverage so that fellow devs can applaud and be confident that something good is happening. That said, a lot of tests are either meaningless in that they pass whatever what, or so flaky that maintaining them becomes such a burden that you just want to delete them. \n Recently, it has happened several times that I just ditched all unit tests and mocks and fired testcontainers with a real PG instance. \n Of course, unit tests have their place for business logic where no external dependencies are involved. In such cases, it also helps to use fuzzy testing and property-based testing. \n Now I am rereading the wonderful article by Fowler on tests, but I am sure some of you might have a lot of insightful things to say on the topic.\n    submitted by    /u/dondraper36  \n [link]   [comments]",

After all, software engineering is fighting complexity almost by definition. \n That said, because of the tone and Uncle Bob's authority, those out-of-nowhere rules like \"methods can't be longer than 5 LOC\" or \"methods can't have more than one parameter\" became associated with clean code. \n A much better book on writing great code is A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout. What I like the most is that John has a very nuanced view on software design, and instead of magic numbers and prohibitions he comes up with useful ideas like deep/shallow modules. This single chapter made me rethink how I write code and think about complexity. \n As for less philosophical rukes, there's a favorite of mine that in my opinion tremendously improves average code. It's guard clauses or, simply speaking, early returns. I know, there used to be the opinion rooted in old programming languages that a routine must have only one return. This is fortunately no longer true, and in the language I use 99% of the time (Go) , returning early is one one of the common best practices. \n What are your favourites?\n    submitted by    /u/dondraper36  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’d like to recommend this book I’ve read a while back (Chip & Dan Heath - Decisive). Many things I've read there continue to echo in my head.\n So this is a book about decision making. The authors researched business decision making primarily, but many of the findings make sense in the context of decisions that developers, especially lead devs regularly make.\n The book mentions common known biases in decision making, such as the famous sunk cost fallacy or loss aversion. But what I like really about the book is that it goes way beyond that and focuses on the process of decision making.\n One of the recommendations is to apply a wide context. For example, instead of asking whether the team should do a certain refactor and discussing pros and cons, a better question is: what can the team do in the X engineering hours granted to code maintenance.\n Another interesting advice was that decision makers should actively reach out for opinions that oppose their preferred choice. If you don’t see any disadvantages with the decision, then chances are you didn’t spend enough time to discover your blind spots, and efforts should be made to at least give a chance for counteropinions.\n Another practice mentioned is preparing for failure: what happens if the decision doesn’t bring the expected outcome? If we start this refactor, what do we do if it gets more complicated than we anticipated? When do we stop it? Do we have a clear way of undoing changes, if necessary? What if our changes designed to improve performance turn out to have a catastrophic effect in production?\n I also really like the pragmatic approach they’ve taken: they collected and analyzed hard data to see what decision making practices correlate with better outcomes.\n Have you read other books that are not really focused on software engineering, but contributed to your practices?\n    submitted by    /u/my_dev_acc  \n [link]   [comments]",

Recently, I opened a discussion about introducing one and am facing quite a lot of resistance.\n Obviously there are various benefits of having a unified code style in a big project as this will vastly reduce mental friction when reading others code (or even your own), make it more maintainable etc. \n My colleagues are strongly against introducing it, with the main argument that it will make backporting (and thus cherry picking) \"very difficult\". And backporting happens pretty regularly.\n I haven't had to deal with this situation before where I had to argue so much for a formatter. What I do know is that dealing with a 300k line code base with inconsistent formatting from various developers is a pain in the ass and therefore I'm also pretty adamant about introducing one. \n Do the benefits outweigh the costs or do my colleagues have a valid point about *not* introducing a code formatter?

The thread has some insightful stories and arguments, but I still feel like the hype around microservices did the industry a bad favor. \n MongoDB (closely related to the PG point below). I have several times heard my colleagues discuss MongoDB and want to use it at work. Every single time, my immediate reaction was to ask why and suggest using Postgres instead with its JSONB columns.\n Clean/hexagonal architecture - I think that the underlying ideas (dependency inversion, single responsibility and the rest of SOLID) are great ways to reason about architecture. That said, the marketing hype about clean architecture seems to have created a cult of religious fans to the point where abstractions and layers of indirection are created just because that follows what Uncle Bob wrote in his article. Also, the popular argument of \"now we can swap the database every day\" is so unrealistic in my opinion. I don't really remember ever needing to unexpectedly swap a database. Maybe, I'm wrong. \n Underrated: \n Postgresql - even though it has a great reputation these days, I still think a lot of people would benefit a lot from knowing more about its features and potential. My personal favorite is using PG's FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED feature to implement a simple queue. Whenever I need a task queue, I immediately reach for it. \n Presentation/writing skills: I am not a great presenter and speaker myself, but the more I work as a software engineer, the more I realize that being concise, accurate, and engaging in your writing/speaking is a valuable asset.

Lately I've seen a huge rise in \"How to escape tutorial hell videos\" and while at first it made me feel better by helping me identify the situation I was in, after seen like 10+ videos I've gotten on my recommended over time to see what other tips people might have , they all pretty much say the same thing which is mostly \"just stop an make something yourself\" or how to \"watch tutorials effectively\", which seems a bit unfair when you're still at square 1 not knowing what you don't know you need to learn.\n So as said in the title, what does it mean to leave tutorial hell?\n Is it to never gaze your eyes upon a piece of gamedev content and just sit down, open unity and visual studio and pull out Eric Legyen's Foundations of game engine development volume 1 out my butt?\n Or is it to plan out the 27 part how to make an RPG playlist by myself and just look up things as I encounter them like \"okay so I need to move the player character in 4 directions\" or \"hmm.. I wonder how I can subtract health using a sort of trigger?\"and then look it up learning those pieces of information bit by bit as you need them?\n Sorry for the long rant, I've been holding this in for a while now, thanks a lot if you took the time to read and respond.\n    submitted by    /u/Aiden2959  \n [link]   [comments]",

Before this system, you needed to register in February to be able to participate in June. Now, you can pretty much decide to participate whenever you want and you'll most likely be accepted.\n But there is more to that, and it's far more concerning. Some popular games gets to participate twice while Steam says it's ONE Next Fest (ever).\n I'll take the example of Aloft, a game currently taking of the top slots of Next Fest.\n Well, guess what?

          "description": "Something that's frustrated me for a while is how many store pages for a game on steam will have one or two cinematic trailers and then ten screenshots of environment art without even any UI. Especially in certain genres like action rpgs for example, I want to see the skill tree, what classes are available, their abilities, cool effects on weapons and equipment, but instead of dedicating even a single screenshot to one of the game's systems, it's only art.\n Are studios afraid of pushing away players who might be intimidated by these things? And if so why cater to the people who are more likely to refund and write a bad review once they realize they don't like the systems that were kept hidden from them rather than fans of their game's genre who would actually enjoy the systems if they knew about them? There are so many games I skip by that could be perfect for me but I don't want to spend time doing extra research and looking through a gameplay vid on youtube.\n Edit: I do recognize skill trees were a bad example and the complexity there could turn players away, but I am more referring to showing any core system the game has to offer beyond art style and cinematography\n    submitted by    /u/CzechMateQQ  \n [link]   [comments]",

In 2021 I started a game studio with my friend from university and we released our first game in 2022. Most of the funding for our development came from various grants and out of our own pockets. We thought that maybe some publishers or investors would be interested in our next game, but right now, as you might know, the industry is struggling and most studios have to figure out how to stay afloat and don't want to take any chances.\n Now we're about to release and self-publish our second title this July, but we don't have the numbers we wanted. Our biggest hope was Steam Next Fest, but with over 2000 other games attending right now, the chances of our game getting much attention aren't great... Our numbers for our game are around 3500 wishlists before Steam Next Fest, which doesn't seem like much, but it was a lot of work to get there, especially without a viral video or much marketing experience. Maybe there is someone out there who can relate to this situation and have some advice or words of encouragement because we could really use some right now.\n I will attach some graphs and a link to the game for context in the comments.\n    submitted by    /u/Yellik1307  \n [link]   [comments]",

To parallel that, I want to put stuff in my game with the primary purpose of it never being found. These things wouldn’t have sort of huge lore relevance, nor would they be required to find in order to beat the game. They would just be there to deepen the theme of the unknown. I wouldn’t be surprised if players found some of them, but my goal is to make it impossible to find every secret within the game.\n I completely understand that putting something completely functional in a game that isn’t like developer-tools related is arguably bad game design and really weird to do, but I think i would be thematically fitting.\n My biggest question is well, how do I hide it? There are dataminers out there, and i feel like just datamining all of the secrets would sort of ruin the point im trying to come across. I understand it’s impossible to hold back dataminers forever but I definitely want to make the secrets nearly impossible to find within the code, and maybe just make it frustrating overall to datamine. I understand that the chances of someone datamining a game is relatively low, but once again, don’t want these things to be found, or at least not easy to find.\n The obvious answer would just be to not put it in the game entirely, but i still want these things to be theoretically achievable just so cryptic it is nigh impossible.

But now, we have a bunch of relocated and remote teams, and we want to inspire future generations to see that you don't need to be in a major industry hub to make it big!\n What I've done:\n  \nVenue: Locked in an amazing seaside resort called Porto Montenegro who saw the vision and has an airport.\n Agenda: I'm working on a space where you can showcase your indie games to publishers for investment, connect with other devs, listen to keynotes and party with friends.\n Support: Fundraised enough resources and got commitments from my network to back this event.\n Date: I've locked in October 25, 2024 as I hope this will give me enough time to pull this off.\n  \nNo hidden fees, no corporate BS — just pure, unfiltered passion for game development\n Please let me know what you think of this idea! Any advice, help or support would be much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/disconnected777  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I am working on a post-apocalyptic game that includes a crafting system. You find materials, you convert them into usable items. This includes explosives, and for the most part my aim is to be realistic. There are other elements of the game- firearms, lockpicking, etc, that are already set up to be as real as possible while still being fun.\n My question is, is it illegal to include a crafting recipe for, as an example, nitroglycerine? Can I get in trouble for having a crafting recipe to turn cough syrup into amphetamines? Additionally, if the in-game crafting recipe uses household ingredients (the game is set in a city), is that potentially more legal trouble I could be inviting?\n If someone plays my game, then later creates that dangerous material for real, am I possibly culpable for them doing that, and if so do I need to purposefully obscure the references to real-world materials or even have unrealistic/fictional materials instead?\n Regardless of answers given, I aknowledge that none of the comments provided here qualify as legal counsel.\n    submitted by    /u/CenatoryDerodidymus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR Turning off hyperthreading took the compile time of our GameMaker project down from 4:36 on average to 4:00 flat. That's a time savings of 13%, or a speed increase of 15%. \n I've compiled a lot of games over the years. It always brings all cores up to a full 100% workload for almost the whole process no matter the engine. I've always suspected that, in those cases, hyperthreading might actually be slowing my computer down since it isn't needed if the cores are truly at 100% anyway, and that the computational and thermal overhead produced by hyperthreading isn't necessary in those situations. I never got around to testing it because, honestly, I figured I was probably wrong.\n I finally tested it yesterday. I have a fairly large game project in GameMaker. I cleaned and built it four times with hyperthreading still on and the average time was 4:36 (all were close). I then disabled hyperthreading in my bios and tested four more times. The average was 4:00 flat.\n This is with the following system:\n i7-12700k\n 32 GB DDR4 3200\n WD_BLACK SN850 NVMe SSD\n I suspect other engines would also see a speed increase. Since compile times are a huge part of the game dev process, you might want to test the same thing using a project with your computer/engine. Even a 15% speed increase can add up, and it's free.\n    submitted by    /u/TimPrice2  \n [link]   [comments]",

By 2015 I’d visit this sub regularly, mainly for marketing tips. “Top 10 ways to market your indie game” type posts were my favourite.\n We launched into Early Access in December 2017 out of the long defunct Steam Greenlight programme with 18,000 wishlists. That was enough to get us to the big carousel on the front page of Steam at the time. Everything’s very different now. There are more games, better tools, so many more freely available resources like tutorials, and indies generally seem way more marketing savvy. I’m quite relieved we got in there when we did though, I think we’d struggle a lot more starting out now. It definitely still looks possible though; I’m looking forward to the next project.\n I just wanted to say thanks for the help. This sub is a great source of information, and reassurance when things aren’t going quite to plan.\n There's a little post here about how we almost didn't make the game, banging our head against the kickstarter: https://imgur.com/gallery/fArGK7j\n    submitted by    /u/LiamSlugdisco  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd assume many here has read that article.\n To sum it up for those who haven't: the moment a game gets 10 reviews, it not only gets an \"official score\" (like \"Mostly positive\" or \"Mixed\") but also gets WAY more visibility on Steam for a few days.\n Now, one thing that isn't mentioned in the above article is if the \"10 review-effect\" is also happening when the game has already been around for a long time (like mine).\n Another gamedev told me that their game didn't get any noticeable increase in traffic when, after one year, they got their tenth review by a paying customer.\n So, I was wondering: has any small-scale dev here been in my situation, waiting for that tenth review, hoping for a boost in traffic, and then getting it/not getting it?

I feel like the game is now a much different product than what it was 3 years ago when it was first released, with a ton more features and contents included in the base game (not counting the contents added in the six DLCs). \n Also since the game has been out for three years, most of the videos/screenshots people have been sharing are of the \"old looks\", so I'd love to distinguish from that.\n Now that I feel like I am done updating this game and ready to move on to the sequel, I wonder whether it makes sense to give the game a new \"identity\" by calling it XXXX: XXXXX Enhanced Edition. Do you think this is a good idea, or has this practice been used too much in the gaming industry? It's like every other 5-year old game out there has an \"Enhanced Edition\", \"Director's Cut\" etc. lol\n    submitted by    /u/Rotorist  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I've worked at a couple games companies and one I worked at had some very funny gameplay requsts/ requirments and outright outlandish statements from senior staff. One in perticular that still makes me chuckle is telling us we'd failed as game devs because we insisted we should include a mouse sensitivity slider for our game. We were told that the mouse sensitivity should be perfect! and no one should have any need to adjust their mouse sensitity for the game.\n We had to explain that people prefer different mouse sensitivities and not one setting fits everyone. We had a perfect example among our dev team. Me using a edpi of around 2400 and another developer using a edpi of around 400. Needless to say we were never allowed to add a mouse sensitivity slider because according to that senior staff member we were wrong in thinking we needed one. The company is now closed down.\n In general it was like they hated the idea of giving the player any way of changing anything in options, and this is only one example. I just thought that this was a hilarious one that got brought up.\n    submitted by    /u/Plus-Pie3898  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can confidently say it had no impact whatsoever. I did get a huge spike in direct navigation, but the sales yesterday were actually at some of the lowest of the week. I saw someone say in the comments \"I can't buy it because it costs 100.000\". Which translates to $3.7. The normal price of the game is $7 in USA. This is Steam's auto conversion which they recommend. I suppose this is a Vietnamese thing, but still so strange to see literally no one buy it when the youtuber is having a great time.\n Edit: As a commentor said, Steam is currently banned in Vietnam. I'm devastated.\n Edit2: People told me to put the name and link in the post.

          "description": "Take the most simple idea you can possibly imagine.\n Simplify it more, it's still way too complicated.\n Don't start from making art. Do a playable prototype using most basic 2d or 3d shapes. Gameplay first. There are some exceptions, but this approach wouldn't hurt them either.\n Make sure the prototype you've made is good enough to reflect your desired gameplay on 80-90%.\n After - look at your prototype with a very new look, and think once again of the MOST simple art style that could represent your idea \"well enough\". Replace simple shapes with some assets. Don't be afraid of using Assetstore or other places to buy/get your assets if they fit. No-one really cares about their originality as long if it fits and it's fun.\n Register pages for all important social media the day you start. Post everything you do there, start getting some followers. Remember, making a game is always much longer process then you expect, the game you want to make in 2 weeks may take 2 month, may take 2 years. Before you finish - you'll have some audience to start with. If you start late - you will regret not starting at once. It will take months of daily posting just to make it a habit, so it's much better to start at day 1.\n The hardest thing in making a game is 'completing and releasing' it. Make this your main goal and priority. Everything else goes second.\n  \np.s. This strategy works not only for the 1st game, but I'd stick to it in general.

Like a gacha game but singleplayer and with no microtransactions at all.\n What I mean by that is that predatory games are very fun. There's something about them, the way they reward you and hook you, that makes people want to spend so much money.\n Well imagine a game where you CAN'T spend anything, but it's still designed to be as addictive and fun. A simple one-time, offline singleplayer purchase but with the fun of one of those games.\n Why would anyone make this? Well, a big company won't, it would want to squeeze every dime.

          "description": "I recently stumbled upon a Reddit post where someone was struggling to come up with a name for their game. It got me thinking about our own journey to naming “Castle of Blackwater” and the memories came flooding back. Naming a game is no small feat, and it was quite challange for us too. \n We knew from the start that we wanted to create a social deduction game. During the Christmas holiday, I traveled to Spain and spent some time working on different concepts. I explored a few ideas: one had a medieval theme, another was more temple-like, and the last concept revolved around a magical castle. The magical castle vibe resonated with us, so I immediately started writing the backstory and drafted the first two chapters. It was during this process that I envisioned a magical river with black water, which became a key element in the lore. \n After returning from my trip, I sat down with my co-founder to brainstorm the name. This process took quite a while. We thought “Blackwater” sounded catchy and had a certain allure and mystery to it. Our first idea was “Battle of Blackwater,” but a quick Google search led us straight to a Game of Thrones episode. Clearly, we couldn’t use that. \n Finally, we landed on “Castle of Blackwater,” and it just felt right. It’s been quite some time since then, and now we’re gearing up for our Steam launch at the end of 2024. It’s funny to think back on those days and see how far we’ve come. \n Now, I’m curious how did you come up with the name for your game or username? Or maybe you have a funny story about how you created your online identity?\n Curious to know!\n    submitted by    /u/Castle_Of_Blackwater  \n [link]   [comments]",

If a random friend was to ask me how to get started in gamedev, I would point them in that direction. It's the right choice in a whole lot of situations.\n But there are those of us also working completely outside of those frameworks - you know who you are! And for the most part, you know why you've made this choice. There are many valid reasons for wanting to DIY your game engine, and it's a subject of a post all it's own... but right now I want to share one note and one giant lesson for anyone on this path:\n .\n First, the note: You're not alone. it might feel like it, because we don't really have …",

Just to give some background, it's a freemium mobile word game with $5 premium option (includes extras, ad removal and access to an extra game mode). \n I'm just having trouble understanding that mentality... Why does it seem like most people will pay $10 for a Frappuccino they'll enjoy for five minutes but expect a mobile game they can theoretically play forever to be free? And then if it is free, they complain about the ads?\n Is it the mobile game market that has set those expectations? Is it the non-traditional casual gamers who are less willing to pay for games in general (which doesn't make logical sense to me - if you like something, you should be willing to pay for it, imo). Is it something else?\n Admittedly, I'm not the most savvy business person... just a designer/developer who enjoys making stuff. But I feel the product is worth way more than $5 so it's really disappointing when I read a paradoxical review that simultaneously raves about the quality of the game and treats it like it's worthless.

Is there a certain stage of development where it makes sense to start releasing footage of it for marketing purposes? Is it paranoid to be afraid of one's idea getting stolen? Please share any thoughts on this subject.\n I have been developing a game full-time for almost a year by myself. The game is an idea that I have had for a while and that I believe to be both original and eye-catching. I myself enjoy playing what I have created so far, and friends and family that have played have also had the reaction that I was hoping for.\n As of now I have been keeping my game very close to the chest. But I am currently considering looking for investments in my game and then I would obviously have to share everything about it. I am not super scared that a potential investor would steal it, since I would try to only approach serious actors but if you have any thoughts on this please share them.\n Edit:\n Thank you all for your input! But all I see is a bunch of people trying to convince me to share my idea so they can steal it.. /s No, but for real, I really appreciate all your views and I hear what many of you are saying about the importance of exposure and the low likelihood that anyone will put in the effort to steal something that has not yet been proven. I will rethink my approach and will share my game sooner than I intended. But first I want to have a few more features in place and some minimal polishing as well.

          "description": "I've been working on my game for around 2-3 years. There were times when I was anxious about negative feedback and the lack of wishlists. But 2 days ago, I launched my game. Here's what I'm feeling right now.\n Firstly, I feel relaxed and calm. I'm also missing the sense of \"I have work to do\", which was a huge part of my life every day for the last few years. All that tension is gone. I feel empty, but in a good way. I'm still getting used to the feeling of having nothing to do.\n Yesterday, a few hours after launch, I went out and met some friends and had a good time. I didn't think about my game at all (which was weird to be honest). Today, I cleared out some old junk in my \"studio\". I also wiped clean the white board I used to write my daily to-do lists. It's blank for the first time in many years. That's exactly how I am feeling.\n I know there's still work to do with regard to promotions and fixing game issues as and when they come up. But I know for a fact that the actual mountain of gamedev work has been conquered. This feeling of knowing I've reached my goal is incredible. Guys, I'm not saying it's a high, but it's a high. Not an intense high. But a high nonetheless.\n IMO completing my game and releasing it is the conclusion of my game dev journey, or at least the first of many journeys. Although, the sales have been so-so thus far (don't ask about it), it does feel immensely rewarding to just know that my creation is out there, and that people are playing it! \n Regardless of what happens, I know my future self will look back on these post-launch moments fondly. I think whatever I'm feeling makes the struggle worth it. I also know that if there existed a club for indie devs who have completed and published a game, I'm officially in it.\n Anyway, if you're a new solo indie game developer reading this, trust me when I say that completing an indie game and publishing it is an awesome feeling. In fact, it's a huge achievement in and of itself.\n    submitted by    /u/cs_ptroid  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "It's an infinite loop: you crave making a game, you start developing something, you get bored or burnt out, you stop. I was really enjoying the process, I like making games and I like using Godot, but then yet again I stopped. This time I reflected a bit and I understood why it happened. Apparently I don't have a clear goal. I start to think about \"why should I make this game, there are thousands better than mine\". I make games since I was 14 (now I'm 32) and when I was younger it was very easy for me working consistently to a game, indeed I released several games. The simple \"I just want to make a game because yes\" worked at that time. Now it doesn't work anymore and the lack of a reason, something to achieve for having developed a game makes me lose the direction and the beauty of creating something. Does it happens to you too? Should I simply give up making games? (I can't, after some times I inevitably come back making games 🫤) Do you have any suggestion?\n    submitted by    /u/fuck---spez  \n [link]   [comments]",

We’re aiming to maintain the compatibility with the existing community-driven plugin. Last but not least, the Godot support plugin is set to be bundled with Rider in the 2024.2 release.\n  \nThis is fantastic news, and more proof that Godot is well on the way to being acknowledged as a first class engine alongside the usual Unity & Unreal duo.\n PS: Jetbrains IDE are paid software but the EAP (early access program) will allow you to use the early access version for free!

Those numbers are 100% from my own \"marketing\" efforts. There are people way better at this than me! I'm just sharing my experience here and I'll let you judge if it's helpful.

I know little to nothing about how to write shaders but i think that it detects the edges of objects, selects some points with a set distance from each other and draws a straight line between them. I am not sure if it works like that but that's my best guess.\n Anyways, i would like other people to share their thoughts on this and some insight on where i could learn to write shaders. I will take a look at the docs in the meanwhile.\n    submitted by    /u/Glebzard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. It’s just a random thought, but why attack somebody like Sony for client info when you could attempt to breach an ISP? Wouldn’t they hold more information that could be sensitive? I’m sure it would open a whole different can of worms in terms of internet security though. I’d imagine an ISP has different security conventions as opposed to any other randomly picked company.\n I just feel like if a malicious party really wanted to do damage, they wouldn’t focus on companies like Sony or whatever. I mean you gotta know once you’ve gone that far there’s no going back, and if you get caught it’s likely life in prison. So go for broke?\n Has this been done before? Why do you think cyber criminals focus on other businesses instead of ISP’s? Just curious is all. Always kinda wondered how secure an ISP was anyways, considering companies like Apple use services like Private Relay now. Is there a need for better security on the ISP’s end? Like, we have numerous methods to protect ourselves on our end, but what if we got attacked from that side as opposed to a leak of passwords, etc. from a random site?\n    submitted by    /u/CarsonKaiser  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have an image that supposedly has a hidden message. I've tried using exiftool, strings, DiiT, /stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/, http://futureboy.us/stegano/, steghide, stegcracker (i currently have a python script running as I'm trying to brute force the passphrase since we weren't given one), and I just dont know where to go from here. I don't think I'm able to attach the actual image file here (or I'm just too sleep deprived to see it which is the most likely case).

I would like to complete this data using the correct data for this moment which still exists in the mkv file.\n I have already extracted the necessary video/audio data from the mkv. From what I see, the audio in the mp4 is inserted in blocks without any additional data, but unfortunately the video blocks are preceded by some preliminary data that I will have to recreate somehow. This is probably some data resulting from the structure of the mp4 file, but I will have to look for this information.\n Is there a free hex editor that will allow me to visually separate these video/audio blocks while I work? For example, so that I can mark and then find their beginnings and ends and easily jump between them, or to easily compare the contents of two shorter blocks that are not next to each other in the data sequence.\n Currently, I use the HxD editor, but here I work with the one block of entire data, without any visual selection options, which is why I often get lost in it.\n    submitted by    /u/Lexard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I found a bunch of unknown devices on my wifi network. The apartment I live in has wifi they pay for as part of a package, but I have my own account. I called Spectrum and they gave me a Mac address for the main unknown device which was coming from a Belkin_ext router. What I noticed:\n My wifi signal (MINE) and the signal for Belkin_ext were the same strength as I walked around the property. \n When I looked at the belkin_ext router info on the wifi settings list, the Mac address was the same for the mystery devices that had been previously connected. They matched. This is new to the apartment and mine is close to the office. \n I blocked new devices from entering and changed my password and name. Then 3 devices were blocked from connecting (apple and Lenovo pc). \n This whole thing started when I reported illegal activity in the complex to the property manager (Charged with ID THEFT but didn't jail time). \n I suspect cameras or bugs, and an RF detector picked up from only one outlet. But I cant find anything in there when pulled out...\n I am really stumped how I can prove this. Does anyone have advice? She has a personal vendetta against me for no valid reason. I'd love some of your help in making sure I take correct measures to police. And making sure it's HER. I can't see her router but maybe I can see something on the public lounge computer. \n Thank you!!!\n    submitted by    /u/Planit4Squad  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So like the title says I'm currently in school pursuing my cybersecurity degree and at the moment I'm really struggling in my ethical hacking class. For an assignment I have a list of password hashes along with a hint of what they could be. In this case the first set of passwords are a kaiju followed by three digits and a single lowercase letter with an MD5 hash applied to them. The second set off passwords are a basic color (think crayola basic 12 set teachers words not mine) followed by a kaiju name and these are a SHA-1 hash. I was able to get one password from the first set and I was able to get 4 passwords from the second set. l've been coming up with wordlist after wordlist but nothing else has cracked and l've been wracking my brain for the past 3 days. If anyone is willing to offer some advice it would be hugely appreciated. Also l've been using hash-identifier, hashcat, as well as Johnny for this assignment, and I think l've got the basics down for how they work\n    submitted by    /u/Starthelegend  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hospitals in London have had to cancel cancer operations this week because of a Russian cyber-attack that continues to cause serious disruption to NHS services in the capital.\n  \nCancer surgeries delayed: St Thomas’ and King’s College hospitals have been forced to postpone cancer operations due to the cyberattack. This critical delay is because the attack crippled their ability to provide blood transfusions, a vital procedure during many cancer surgeries.\n Widespread disruption across NHS services: The attack goes beyond these two major hospitals. It's impacting six NHS trusts and dozens of GP practices in southeast London, affecting millions of people's care. This disruption includes cancelled appointments and likely extends beyond just blood-related procedures.\n Lack of transparency causing unease: While NHS England acknowledges the attack and its impact, they haven't released details on the number of cancelled operations, including critical procedures like transplants. This lack of transparency is causing frustration and unease among both staff and likely patients who are unsure about the status of their appointments.\n  \nDr Chris Streather, the medical director for NHS England’s London region, said : “We are sorry to all those who have been impacted and staff will work hard to re-arrange appointments and treatments as quickly as possible.”\n Source (The Guardian)\n    submitted by    /u/Used-Bat3441  \n [link]   [comments]",

My team is currently doing security-requirement evaluation, and there is a requirement that talks about performing HTTP fuzzing on a device that does not act as a server; it is a bad requirement essentially.\n There is some belief within the team that we could try to fuzz one of the shared libraries (.so) that handles some of the lower-level HTTP logic, but it does not house code that is used for routing or anything like that.\n Personally, I'm not convinced that such a fuzzing tool even exists for this type of use case, but I want to make sure I cover my bases before discussing again within the team. I've spent ample time researching, and could not find anything pertinent.\n My question is, does anyone have any knowledge of such a tool?

We could use a dis assembler and mod the assembly serial check to not jump out of the code when a bad serial was entered. We could reassemble and enter anything into the serial and had a full working software. Oh, them days was fun. Then the software programmers became smarter and they started checking for the disassembler. A ugly prompt would open up saying the disassembler software being used could not be used. I was sad. It was fun for a while just to see how things worked. Then it became hard. Doh. \n    submitted by    /u/Silent_Cup2508  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically I've found that one of the biggest wifi providers in my country uses a combination of a set prefix and the last few letters of the wifi name as a default password. I think that's still okay AS LONG AS THEY TELL PEOPLE TO CHANGE IT. I remember when we got our wifi, they just gave us the password and said that that was the one we needed to use. No recommendation to change the password or how we could do so. I had to do it myself once I realised that anyone could easily log into my wifi. Now I've tested this default password on every wifi network of the same provider I've come across. I've connected to around 20 of them and only one had changed their password. This is extremely dangerous because it's a (basically) open port to any wifi(one of the largest providers here btw) that can easily be exploited...\n So are the default passwords similarly set up where you live?\n I'd love to hear from you guys. I can say that as far as I've seen, in europe the passwords are randomly generated.\n Any advice is welcome!\n    submitted by    /u/Obviously_Special  \n [link]   [comments]",

So mods, if you delete this post, I would appreciate anyone letting me know a more appropriate place to post this.\n For background: I initially learned Java 8 years ago and it got me hooked on computer science. I've gone down a traditional path for the most part as I now do back-end IT work focused on cloud migration, though have done a number of ad hoc projects that go beyond that and worked in a more data-analyst-esque position before I ended up in this job 8 months ago. I have professional experience in Python, R, SQL (Redshift, SQL Server, MySQL, and MS Access for whatever that might count for...), VBA, and some familiarity with bash and PowerShell to the extent that I could use the internet to help me automate some recurring processes.\n I discovered ethical hacking recently and I think it's something I want to pursue. But, if I'm being honest, learning this feels pretty daunting and I'm not really sure where to begin (I've got a Linux VM booted up at the very least). \n More or less, I'm looking for someone with experience that I can learn from and get support from. If anyone is interested and wants to chat, I'd be more than happy to compensate with my own hourly wage if it becomes long-term (my hope) .\n Really, I'm just looking for quality resources for a complete beginner because, while I can code, I'm definitely lacking in the knowledge required here.\n    submitted by    /u/BeanPaddle  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I'm looking for a C2 (Command and Control) framework that supports SOCKS5 communication between the target and the server. The server needs to be hosted as a hidden service (.onion), and the implant (reverse shell) should connect to the server's .onion address. Does anyone have any recommendations?\n Why am I looking for this? All the C2 frameworks I have seen suggest using a second server as a proxy to mask the real IP of the attacker. This incurs costs since you need to rent a server and do so anonymously. From what I’ve seen, TOR offers this possibility completely free of charge. Additionally, you can run an entry or exit node at home without much hassle.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Peon117  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll be graduating by this year with a CS degree but I still know nothing about coding.\n I wasn't a good student from the beginning and in the second year I had a mental breakdown after facing so much failure in life and because of that I had a huge drop in the cgpa. I was living alone in the hostel and could't even share anything with my parents. But when I gave up on everything I finally decided to quit my life and finally show my grades to parents before that. It was one of the hardest decisions of my life, and when I showed my grades to my parents I saw my father cry for the first time in life. At that moment, I forgot everything and promised myself I'd become a better student and resettle the things I've done bad.\n Fast forward to 2024, I did become a good student, my grades came up, took studying seriously and gave the exams seriously. But as you all know uni teaching doesn't make you a better programmer so I am still not so much skillful to get a job.\n So, anyone reading this I'd really be so much blessed if you can show me or advice me a lerning path. My goal is to now restart the coding learning from basics, I am considering to start with CS50. Will that be a better choice? I want to learn the basics and master DSA in these few months and trynna enter Leetcode. Would this be a better approach or if you think there is faults in my plan.

          "description": "I recently came to the conclusion that old programming books are better than new ones. This will be preposterous to some and, I suspect, obvious to others. \n Old books are better because those that remain in the public consciousness are certified classics. They have withstood the tests of time, remaining relevant, which means they must have value of some kind. \n This value is two-fold. They either provide technical knowledge that has remained timeless or they provide valuable historical context, and the outdated technical knowledge can be overlooked. \n Historical context is not something that many people look for in programming books, but they should. Understanding the history of an idea helps us understand the idea in greater detail. Particularly, most of the history of computer science was driven by individuals who aimed to solve relevant problems within constraints. By understanding who these individuals were, the problems they were trying to solve, and the constraints they operated within, we are able to better understand the ideas and tools that were developed. \n For example, I would highly recommend The Design and Evolution of C++ by Bjarne Stroustroup. This book teaches history, philosophy, language building, low-level programming, and effective design in the context of C++, covering why and how it was developed. \n When you read old programming books, whether for technical know-how or historical facts, you begin to see that everyone involved was human. Everything in programming makes sense to humans because it was designed by humans. The pioneers who came before, although extremely talented, were humans like you or me, and this is a reassuring thought to remember. \n I would recommend reading old books, especially for beginners. They provide context in a seemingly context-less world and help to make sense of the complexity of programming. \n Hope this helps someone!\n    submitted by    /u/GenghisKharr  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all, so I'm in the pretty early stages of teaching myself web development for a personal creative project, and frankly it's been kind of slow putting the pieces together! I'm old and I got time so my progress is pretty slow. All I want to do eventually is post bloggy type things involving photos, doodles, and some music-y things I'm making. I'm learning completely solo so I don't have classmates to rant to!\n I've ruled out that I need python for now, but I've settled on Internetting is Hard and W3Schools for html/css education. On my own account I tried to download Jekyll because it sounded like it'd be helpful, and it may be, but it got me more familiar with 1) the Terminal, 2) VSCode, 3) Ruby, and 4) Homebrew and all of those things were terrifying to me before. Jekyll is enabling me to kind of see results of learning/tinkering a little faster than what I was doing before.\n Installing Jekyll through Terminal via Homebrew was such a cool learning experience.\n So why am I saying this is kind of a superpower? I'm also learning markdown elsewhere because certain programs like Notenik, Spaces, or Logseq use them, and it's a pretty nifty thing. Those types of programs are just helping me write better notes.\n And it hit me that ALL OF THIS IS JUST TEXT (duh that's what HTML is dude!) and it's just kind of amazing to me that you can build a whole valuable website and automate all sorts of things just by writing stuff out and placing it in the right spots. And the fact that it's just text files means it's super shareable, savable, and open. It's wild.\n Here and in other subreddits folks have been so helpful so I just wanted to write this out, if only for an affirmation. By the end of the summer I'll have a tiny simple stupid website that matches my vision and in April it literally seemed impossible.\n edit:\n this is awesome\n    submitted by    /u/Interesting-Head-841  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got into interview and it went really well i did have some experience/projects in python[Machine learning and Web development] to showcase so like the interviewer is impressed but at last he started telling me that \"so this is a small company this internship will cost you $20[₹1700] for the mentorship we provide. You have to build and give them two projects in 1 month tenure\" - exact words.\n So here i am confused about what to do, at first i thought it is a scam because though this was a unpaid internship i did sign up unwillingly but now they are want me to pay them. EDITED[Added] - 'And the second thought which comes in mind was this can be true because I don't about other countries but whenever I searched on LinkedIn and location in India for the internships there are number of internships which wants me to pay like $5[₹500-₹800]. They are just like distributing internships certificate and the tasks are like make a calculator. That's where i thought it can be real.'\n What are views on this should pay them and start or try another internship?\n Also if you can refer me some good internship, please show your kindness.\n    submitted by    /u/ketan_v_astro  \n [link]   [comments]",

I really need to keep up if I wanna build with them.\n Has anyone else found it slow or is it me who's the slow one?\n    submitted by    /u/anewtablelamp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a work history of starting my career in healthcare as a medical assistant and worked for 8 years. Since I am done with school I really want to get into the tech field but I do not know where to start. I have applied internships in the past and last year I got an interview with conEdison about an internship opportunity for computer science but I did not get it. I reached out to other companies but I never got an answer back. So I am just lost and unmotivated. I also have a fear to do interviews now because Im not an expert in programing yet, I dedicated my time doing well in school and doing other subjects in classes that my focus in being a good programmer shifted to just getting work done. I want to have a place in the field because I feel that if I am in a tech working environment, then I will thrive and do more in that aspect of the career. \n I worked on several small projects like database management project, some small python projects, web development (html, css, javascript) when I made a grocery store website. and my latest project was making an android app in regards to finding a visa. So I have some experience but not enough to answer any technical questions such as problem solving and algorithms. But I really want to and I feel like all of that motivation I had faded a little bit. \n After I completed my bachelors and when I also finished my finals I felt so drained that I did not feel like getting up from bed, going out, I could not focus on my planning. so I am very demotivated, but I had some time to rest and reflect, my mind feels bit clear. So I contacted several of my school staff to see where I should go and talk to and hopefully they point me at the right direction. \n In the mean time I want to see some outside help, some opinions and I would appreciate that. thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/jorex5  \n [link]   [comments]",

Enough of partying and enjoying my late 20s, I decided in my 30s, I want to work to improve myself and I want to be better in programming. I have started the Coursera courses but I do not understand Algorithms at all. What can I do to help myself?

Are there any fundamentals or books that I can approach to understand better?\n At work sometimes I feel stupid, but because I have been working for years, I have good people skills and communication skills, and I also understand the system a bit better so I can guide my colleagues, and my juniors and bosses seem to enjoy my company. But I want to be better so that I can lead better, and also guide my juniors. When asked about specific Java topics, sometimes I just don't know the solution and I feel like I don't deserve being a senior.\n I cannot even solve some of the simple LeetCode questions and it's honestly depressing.

As the only female developer in the company, I was scared that I wouldn't fit in, but it was completely the opposite! Three years later, the company is shutting down, and I will soon be out of a job.\n After I started applying for jobs a few months ago, I realized how much I don't know. I can build something, and most of the time I'll find a solution and complete the task, or the app. I felt like I understood most of the things I was working with.\n A few months ago, an interviewer asked me about state management in Angular, and I looked at him like he came from another planet.\n Of course, that didn't go well, and I didn't get a job offer. I decided to ask the team lead at my current job about this question, and he told me that we never really used state management in the apps we were building.\n Not to mention that the latest version we were working with was 12.\n This is all my mistake. Complaining about the amount of work I had to do, or the overtime work would be a bad excuse. Instead of focusing only on the tasks, I should have kept learning in my free time. Now that version 18 is out, I am missing a lot, and I feel so embarrassed. I am scared of applying for jobs now and am even reconsidering working in a coffee shop until I catch up on all the missing concepts we never covered at my soon-to-be ex-company. I should have found a mentor a lot earlier.\n Enough of this.\n To everyone entering the world of programming and learning: don't give up if you're passionate about it.

What is unclear at the moment: * What is a driver actually needed for, what does it do exactly? * Why can a generic driver be enough? Is this similar to protocols like tcp where the application that uses tcp at the end just sens generic tcp segments over the network? * Do drivers expose an API to developers? And how do they do this? Is this a special file I access or a library in a programming language? How does this work? * When I use, let‘s say an USB device from my app, how do I access it? Do I use such an API of the driver (e.g. an USB HID driver)? Must I interpret USB packets / HID reports?\n A concrete example would be greatly appreciated.

          "description": "Comming from data science learning OOP (with C#) is actually not easy for me and I wonder if other people feel the same:\n Want to print \"Hello World\"? You need a class for that. What is a class? A class can instantiate objects and has fields and methods. Ok. What are fields? A field is a Variable of any type that is declared directly inside a class or structure. Fields should not be accessed directly but always through Properties. Ok what the fuck is a property? A property is a member of a class that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field. Huh? Private fields? And then you go from there to accessors, getters setters, encapsulation, Interfaces, abstraction, Abstract classes, delegates, SOLID, KISS, etc. etc.. Compared to, say Python, C# feels like it puts many hurdles purposefully in front of you to execute seemingly easy tasks.\n Or in other words: It feels like watching Harry Potter part 5 without any knowledge of the previous parts. You can appreciate the film for its value but have no clue why things are happening. The level of abstraction in C# if you were to start learning today puts a huge backlog of concepts and things to learn on you.\n More specific: my main gripe at the moment is that it is actually not trivial how to communicate between classes and that I still never know when I need to instantiate an object or not to get the functionality I need. Accessor types are also still a mystery for me in practice although I know everything I need to know in theory.\n In Data science the whole process of writing code is much more sequential and I feel I get more oportunities to actually write the juicy parts where as in C# I am constantly held back by code structure and architecture.\n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/Mafiale  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't see it that way though. \n I took computer studies in school during my first semester, but the teacher I had was boring and made classes very uninteresting. Even though it was an open course, it was obvious that he expected us to know some code, and I knew nothing. His lessons were just written on pdfs, and he expected us to understand. Additionally, I found him to be quite unapproachable when it came to asking for help. All around me were coding geniuses, and I couldn't understand anything. It made the classes hell for me, and overall, it just distanced me from coding.\n A few weeks ago, I started to try to learn again by enrolling in the Harvard CS50 course on EdX. But I can't seem to find time to do it, and again, coding just doesn't seem interesting. Plus, I'm really burned out from school right now. The only motivation I have for coding is its pay. I want to like it and I want to learn, but I can't pick up on anything, and I still haven't developed an interest in it. \n I really needed to get all of this off my chest, as my sister doesn't understand why I don't want to do it, and I'm just really stressed right now with exams coming up and schoolwork in general. \n I really want to know if anybody was in a similar situation. \n Thanks for reading all of this\n    submitted by    /u/yuzzy21  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been struggling a lot when it comes to what outside resources are good to emulate and learn from, vs when it becomes a crutch that hinders learning. I would have no idea how to make a compiler, but I think if I had a template I could eventually learn it (by searching everything I don't know and slowly assimilating what I find out). Do other people use \"templates\" like this? \n If I want to do something ambitious I quickly get overwhelmed just figuring out all the unknown unknowns. I guess experience will help with that, but what resources do experienced people turn to? Documentation? How do you find what you need without reading everything? I have had times where something I made was actually done already in a library I was using and I was just unaware of it lol.\n I feel like I am not really learning, just becoming a more experienced pattern matcher or copying machine. I can make hacky solutions sometimes, but I want to write better and I don't know how to bridge that gap without basically copying more experienced people's work to try and adopt their style/solutions/decision making process etc...\n    submitted by    /u/Ambulare  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would like to teach you programming basics preferably in python or js and help you with beginner projects so you apply the concept you learned (learn a little apply a lot) but in return i want you to help me upgrade my teaching skills and soft skills , like give feedbacks about the way i explain/talk... And if we become freinds that s a plus. I made this post because i kinda have social anexiety and i want to stop out of my comfort zone . P.s: i don t know the hours i can do per week but i think it can be bwetween 1-5hours and i can give you ressources if you want to study on your own , and the learning gonna be via voice calls, if there s more then one person that want that it would be very great and we can make like a group but i doubt it a lot , last thing is i really enjoy teaching pepole even if i am not the best at it :)\n    submitted by    /u/Important_Let_9489  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was pay blocked in only 5 minutes into the tutorial.\n codecademy was the place i heard about that was free. I'm not sure if this is a recent change or maybe python was never free. I got about 30 minutes into C++ but from the little that i worked on ren'py, i liked python more.\n So it leads back to my topic title, is there are place that teaches Python for free or at least 1 time payment. I want to take it at my own pace and fear subscription services.\n edit: saw another thread where this guy posted this link for python courses. $20 for learning python in 60 days. I'm seeing people say udemy is good. Would you guys recommend? a coupon code seems to be attached with the link already too. https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/?couponCode=LEADERSALE24B\n I did try YT and search for people teaching python, but there's so many people doing it, is there one specific channel / guide you guys would recommend if not taking an online course?\n EDIT AGAIN: So after spending a few hours trying out Python vs GDScript. I'm going to be going with GD script. I'm loving how it works just slightly better then Python, but both are good. What won me over was that I had already planned on using Gadot as the first game engine i would try. So it only made sense to use the language that is native to that engine.

          "description": "I installed Linux (specifically Arch + GNOME) about a week ago and I am very positively surprised!\n I always thought that Linux was for people who know what they are doing (🤓) and have a specific reason for doing it. Out of curiosity, I separated a small partition so that I could test whether I could even install it and use it for a few days, and a day later I decided to format my entire second drive (~500gb) on which I only had a few games and so far I have no reason to go back to Windows! Really, every application I wanted to go/install worked, there are so many guides and videos on YouTube explaining how to do various things.\n I can understand that some people may not like the fact that sometimes you have to type something into the console, but for me it's not a big deal to learn a dozen commands. I really see that this is a great community and the openness of the system is wonderful!\n I even told a friend to take a look at Linux, but he's not too interested, even after I showed him that it's a really cool system. However, I understand him, no one likes change if they feel comfortable.\n I really think that there is almost no effort (even Arch, which I installed , people said it might be quite difficult for a first Linux, but I really don't feel it)!\n I wanted to write my story and say Hello to the great community, I'm glad I found myself here!

          "description": "I've often seen how people talk about Alacritty's performance for example, given it is GPU-accelerated and written in Rust (hence compiled from a low-level language with very little overhead), but from my personal experience, I notice little to no difference from any other terminal emulators, at least not anything significant. I might want to add that my work environment and tools are mainly CLI-driven, and I mostly use CLI applications for everything (text editor, Git CLI, etc), including all the tools I use for my daily work.\n When choosing a terminal emulator, I focus mostly on usability and features. I personally use Wezterm because I find it incredibly malleable and easy to configure, while also providing very nice defaults. When I have used Alacritty in the past, I have found myself not liking it because it sacrifices a lot of things for the sake of performance, but I find myself unable to perceive the benefits of such performance improvements.\n I wanted to hear people's opinions mainly because I think I might be missing something, so please feel free to share your ideas and experiences.\n    submitted by    /u/ema2159  \n [link]   [comments]",

They started to prefer permissive licenses more as it suited some people's definition of software freedom. The GPL folks, on the other hand, made it an all or none issue, they wanted to license ALL software under GPL and the other side thought that idea was anti diversity.\n This is very much akin to the editor wars of the Boomer era (Vim vs Emacs) or the IDE wars of the millennial era (Visual Basic vs Borland Delphi, even Netbeans vs Eclipse).\n That's where we stand today and a huge majo…",

I'm discussing internaly the idea of creating a blog about it.\n For a quick recap, i'm a Network Engineer / Programmer that is leading a big Linux corporate migration at Policia Militar de Minas Gerais in Brazil. Our custom Ubuntu 22.04 distro is named \"Guara\" and were officially released yesterday. Guara has lots of custom and opensource software developed for the corporation needs, and aims to replace 22K PCs around the Minas Gerais state. In the first phase, we plan to replace 800 machines running an older Debian distros with mate desktop. This will be our first large scale test, as i write this post Guara is already running in 215 machines. In the second phase we plan to replace Windows 7 and 8 machines. To make the transition smoother we're also creating a series of small tik-tok tutorial videos, teaching basics for end users. Just for a quick note, here are our distro highilights:\n  \nUbuntu 22.04.4 based (24.04 already in the works)\n Onlyoffice 8.0\n Google Chrome\n Linphone as voip client\n Droidcam to use smartphones as webcams\n Some proprietary java applications\n Guara-updater \n Custom application developed for Guara.\n Automaticlally push custom configs at system boot\n \n Guara Installer \n Custom application created for Guara.\n Inventory the system and run initial scripts\n \n Argos Network Center \n Custom application created to test system components\n Test network conectivity\n Set http proxy for all the system (browser, cli and electron apps)\n Remote access with dynamic passwords (like teamviewer)\n \n  \nWe plan to open to project and release all the code as opensource, also create a reference documentation for a corporate linux migration with real world effort and dificulties along the way.\n Here is our special launch video, hope you like it.\n https://youtu.be/0uI0sIvVKAY\n    submitted by    /u/Sea-Load4845  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Not a big thing really, but i thought i'd share.\n Part of my job is running Updates on customer systems with ansible. The includes 2 things: \"Initiate\" the Update by selecting an environment to work with (this ensures you don't have to attach the -i flag to every ansible-playbook command) and then running 4-6 playbooks. Additionally, i do \"custom\" rollouts with any subset out of 30 or so playbooks, which are all contained in a folder.\n I was growing tired of having to type the path to customer inventorys and autofilling playbook names. This is tedious and with playooks often having similar names, i tended to have to type them out almost completely.\n So today, i spend a grand total of 20 minutes putting together two scripts that pipe either the environments or playbooks into fzf and the runs the needed command. So i now get interactive fuzzy search through our customers and playbooks. All of that without having to get a software approved by IT and all done in 10 lines of bash total.\n This then also made me realize i can just push my entire ssh config with some grep and filtering into fzf to get an interactive \"ssh launcher\".\n So really, 30 minutes spend wipping up 3 scripts that will now make my job easier and nicer every day. And that's possible because so many awesome tools are made to \"just work\" with each other through text input and output. That's why i love working on Linux every day.\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "What's the most common complaint people have after switching to Linux? \"Where are all my proprietary Windows/macOS software?\" That's why if you get them to switch to FOSS on their proprietary operating systems first, the eventual switch will be much more seamless. And the great thing is that FOSS developers don't gatekeep their software from Windows/macOS (unlike the other way around), so they can install pretty much every free and open source software out there.\n How do I know this method works? Because it's how I fell in love with FOSS and Linux. I needed a way to remux a video file and all the options out there were paid. Until I came upon ffmpeg, which allowed you to not only remux video, but to do pretty much anything with it. It seemed too good for something that good to be free. That's when I looked into it and learned about free and open source software. After that I slowly switched all of my software to free and open source alternatives, until the only proprietary thing left on my PC was Windows itself.\n    submitted by    /u/crosspacelayer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "After installing Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, naturally I tried to install Steam with apt, to no avail. I decided to just install through the App Center. After that every Steam game not using OpenGL failed to open, but after opening Steam through terminal I realised it's because 'Steam could not initalize Vulkan' (or something to that effect). After a few hours of troubleshooting, thinking it was my drivers, or the Vulkan installation and considering just reinstalling the OS, I seen a post where someone said to reinstall Steam. After manually adding the repository and reinstalling it, lo and behold everything worked absolutely fine. I believe it's because installing it through apt, it installs 32-bit drivers that you don't get with the App Center version. This is a very dumbed down version of events, I was troubleshooting for a while.\n Perhaps it's my fault, I'm not sure. But, to my knowledge, I did what any typical user would do. Install OS - Update OS - Install drivers - Install Steam (through apt), which failed, so I chose to install through the App Center. So, I'm going to put fault on Ubuntu for this one. I have no idea why it wasn't in the apt repo in the first place.\n    submitted by    /u/sauix  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mind you, that I'm using NixOS Stable channel, so I only get Plasma 5.27, but even I'm well satisfied. I used GNOME for about 3 years, before switching to KDE Plasma.\n People say KDE Plasma is too much like Windows, it's too much customization, or it's too buggy. I can argue that GNOME isn't enough. It's great for simple users who don't want to customize anything, but over time, it became annoying that the DE had limits, which you could only modify if you added extensions.\n The only bugs I've seen are graphical glitches that causes some stuttering. But it's not really a deal breaker.\n Graphically, KDE Plasma is very impressive. There's a charming affect whenever this DE interacts with you. There's especially a lot \"fading\" effects, like pressing meta key, dragging different open windows, or opening things on the taskbar. But their selection of desktop backgrounds, even their \"start button,\" and even starting it up where it shows the Plasma icon; it's all so charming. Even their notification sounds are very distinguishable.\n Whereas in GNOME, you get some irrelevant sounds like \"dog bark\" or \"glass\" or \"pop\" sound. None of these sounds have style, nor are they memorable.\n It feels really nice when DEs not only make something nice and snappy, but also put some thought and effort into the branding. In GNOME, all you see is the \"activities\" corner, and that doesn't really help, and I can hardly remember the \"foot print\" logo.\n I do have to say, GNOME has made some very useful software that's hard to pass on: GNOME Disks and Disk Usage Analyzer to say the least. I still use some of the default GNOME programs in my systems.\n But overall, KDE Plasma is very impressive.\n    submitted by    /u/nPrevail  \n [link]   [comments]",

Soon there will be no difference between the web app and desktop app in windows. In which case, Microsoft will have solved my largest sore spot when switching to Linux.

          "description": "With the introduction of the Recall feature for Windows, there is renewed interest in the Linux desktop. With that renewed interest, comes renewed hate toward the Linux desktop by people who feel personally confronted by the privacy + freedom oriented philosophy most Linux users subscribe to.\n \"Privacy doesn't matter to me\" is the common response.\n That is fine. What should matter to users is reliance. Plenty of potential Linux users forgoe the switch because their favorite big tech software doesn't run on Linux.\n \"I have built spreadsheets that don't open in LibreOffice/OpenOffice\"\n \"I need Adobe to edit pictures/create music/read my DRM protected books\"\n These are statements that should give you pause. Is it acceptable that you are reliant on a piece of software to the extent that it ties you to an operating system and set of apps that could be taken away from you at any second? Let us focus on the first statement; how much will you pay for Excel (either in cash or your privacy) so that you can continue editing your favorite spreadsheet? Is there a point at which you would force yourself to learn how to program or translate these spreadsheets into LibreOffice?\n You may not care about Privacy or Freedom, but Microsoft and Apple will at some point set a price that will have you wishing you were Independent.\n No one who switches to Linux should expect the transition to be easy. There will be quirks on your system that you will have to iron out and there are just fundamental differences between Windows and Linux that you will have to get used to. In other words you will need to learn. If you think that is a waste of time, that's fine. In my eyes, and in many others', learning a new skill is never a waste if time.\n I hope this provides a useful perspective.\n    submitted by    /u/wallbucks  \n [link]   [comments]",

The installation would go smooth, but after logging in I couldn't for the life of me get anything to show up. For example I was able to fire up a terminal, execute commands perfectly fine, no errors at all. But starting some applications wouldn't work, they would show up in htop but I couldn't see them. I spent a day debugging this and installed ~5 different distros but still found no solution.\n Being done I got up from my computer, turned on my TV and saw my desktop on the TV. The computer was connected to the TV via HDMI and would make it a primary display despite it being turned off... Having 5 years of experience with Linux I started exploring drivers, looking into logs etc. and it didn't occur to me to check the connected displays.\n Do you have any stories with Linux where you turned out to be a complete idiot when in reality the solution was as simple as unplugging a cable?\n    submitted by    /u/Mrkaniclol  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems a good time, too: Nvidia should finally start working decently well, features like HDR are getting real development, and proton support for games seems to work for almost everything that doesn't involve an invasive anticheat system. For average home users, Linux, collectively, seems to have reached a point where it has everything they need... but when I come to try to recommend a distro to these potential new users, instead of having one or two just solid, uncontroversial options I can hand them and be the end of it, I end up with a long list of \"maybe this one, unless...\" \n When looking for a distro to recommend for the average, not-power-user Windows user, there's a few criteria I feel i…",

          "description": "Here's what I believe Microsoft (and partners) have in store for the future: they are going all-in on pulling an Apple-style switch to ARM on the PC hardware market. This move has several concomitant side-effects:\n  \nMaking AI a mandatory feature on the PC, with all the juicy free data they will be able to harvest from it. Requiring an NPU (i.e. an AI-capable chip) as a standard on all future PCs.\n Herding all the PC Gamer market onto the XBOX (which will still be Intel/AMD based) and possibly onto other upcoming compatible consoles (there's been talk of allowing Steam and Epic marketplaces on the XBOX platform, which would be HUGE... also, a Steam console, anyone?) It's possible that the x86_64 architecture will remain in wide use as gaming hardware.\n (Possibly) Locking down the ability of booting Linux or any other OS on such ARM hardware. This should be contested with all the Anti-Trust legal recourse available everywhere. (EDIT: disproved here)\n Setting back the advance of the Linux marketshare at least for a while. \n  \nThis last point is the one I would emphasize the most: currently, Linux on ARM seems to be kind of an afterthought among developers, and most distributions have builds targeted at the Raspberry Pi and such small platforms. To my knowledge, only RHEL (and its community clones) offer an ARM build with full desktop capabilities, but these seem to be targeted at servers.\n How long until the major Linux distributions catch up with the switch to ARM, and become ready to deliver the current level of software reliability onto the new PCs?\n Easy with the downvoting, people!\n I am presenting my concerns here, I believe these issues should be discussed. No point in burying the post if you don't fully agree with what I'm saying. I would appreciate your opinion and insight, thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Economy_Blueberry_25  \n [link]   [comments]",

This weekend I will wipe my Windows installation and make a \"final\" installation (although let's be real, it will never really be final...).\n I notice I'm making a lot of tweaks to various files in /etc,... like configure Pacman mirrors, networking, tweak sound setup, mess with fstab, and much more.\n The problem is, I have failed to keep track of these changes. So when I will install my \"final\" setup, I will no doubt forget a lot of the tweaks I've made. It's not a big deal, I can just apply them again later, but still it's nice to remember and review these changes. Also maybe later in the future, if I want to install Arch elsewhere, or reinstall my system, it would be nice to see how my /etc will have deviated from the defaults...\n I have found etckeeper, which is nice and I'll probably check it out, but seems more about keeping a complete log of all changes to /etc, which is not entirely what I'm personally interested in. If I update some packages, and they replace some defaults with new defaults I probably won't care about it that much (unless everything breaks of course). But I am really interested in e.g. if manually made some tweaks to the NTP config which I want to replicate on my future laptop install.\n How do you manage this?

I quickly skimmed through the list and saw a few Mesa packages, and a bunch of KDE apps updating from 6.2 to 6.3.\n Installed the updates, everything completed. I rebooted my PC and it appeared to be booting up just fine. When the screen switched to what I would assume would have been the login screen it just went black instead. After a few seconds the UEFI logo for my motherboard was displayed on the screen again and nothing happens after this.\n I used CTRL+ALT+F3 to access the shell, rechecked pacman for updates, but didn't find any. System is fully updated. I tried another reboot, same result.\n I honestly didn't have a lot of time to poke around and troubleshoot as I had to run to work. I'll be heading home soon. Does anyone have any recommendations as to where to look to troubleshoot this or fix this?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/techdaddy1980  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can't lie, it was hard in the beginning to adapt to my new OS, but after researching through the wiki I managed to be in a decent level of understanding how to do basic things such as installing packages, updating the system etc. Then, I tried to install my favorite game, World of Tanks. I was scared first, but I managed not only to install properly the game, but I even got better fps and performance than I used to get in Windows 10. It's unbelievable.

I'm not sure what happened, my guess is it hibernated at a critical time of the system update.\n So, I pull out my trusted USB Arch installer, mount my ssh, arch-chroot, rerun the update to try and fix it, it runs successfully, all well and good. \n I reboot, and the boot sequence welcomes me with a message about my lvm partition being corrupted. I try to let the repair tool run, but to no avail: my system has about 0.5% of my blocks corrupted. Instead of trying to repair it, I decide that the easiest way forward is to do a fresh install. \n Here's the catch. I had a 10h plane trip planned for months 2 days later. Well, if I have 10h to kill, maybe I can use it to reinstall Arch? I check online, and internet access on the plane is not too expensive, so... Why the heck not. \n Fast forward today, as soon as we take off, I start the install, using my mobile phone as a hotspot (to avoid having to deal with signing into the plane wifi website directly) and a Arch Wiki browser. As usual, it takes me a few tries to get a bootable system, but I get there! \n It was a very interesting experience, because with a very slow connection, I had to be very careful and minimalistic about which packages I install. I now have a simple KDE Plasma + a browser running on Arch, all at 30k feet above ground. \n    submitted by    /u/Skasch  \n [link]   [comments]",

Current popular aur helpers don't do that by default, my goal is rectify this by making it mandatory.\n The core features are:\n  \nCorrectness: Build in clean containers always.\n Configurable: Configure builds by host, target and package.\n Parallelization: Build multiple packages in parallel. Parallel download of sources and dependencies.\n Cross-compilation: Build packages for other architectures. (with caveats and limitations at the moment)\n  \npat-aur is not a pacman wrapper.

Quite often I just want to start my PC, log into the terminal, execute like one or two commands and shutdown again. That's why I have my system configured to boot into tty. However, I also want to use my normal UI with i3, firefox, you name it…\n When I want that, I boot into tty, log in, and type \"startx\". WOW! Everything works fine like this, but I'm curious whether I could add a boot-option to grub that boots into something like sddm, while still keeping an option to boot into tty.\n I use systemd, grub and honestly I'm fine with any display manager.\n From my limited knowledge I'd just need the boot-process to graphical.target. Is this correct? How do I accomplish this?

I am no bash expert by any means and I'm sure you'll find mistakes in the script from your experience.\n Features:\n  \nImport from / Export to NewPipe.\n \nFast feed fetch (I have 39 subs and it takes just about 1.5 seconds to update).\n \nThumbnails, Channel Name and Video Title.\n \nSubscribe by just copying channel URL and invoking the script.\n \n Sadly, I cannot get video duration as YouTube doesn't add it into RSS feed\n Here's the link to the script in my dotfiles (if you are interested) which are still work in progress.\n P.S: Make sure to get the dependencies for the script\n  \nIt depends on .scripts/extra/cmdfns for notifications (I use dunst) and mpv function running mpv with some options (you can just omit the options altogether and use your own mpv config file).\n I made a rule to make Konsole floating in RiverWM (Yes, this is river): rule at the bottom of .config/river/init and the floating window script is .scripts/extra/terman\n The script also depends on .scripts/extra/fzfpreview for image preview\n You'll need fzf (of course), curl, perl, xargs, sed and awk (unless you change the fundamental parsing of the script) and mpv + yt-dlp to run the video and chafa and bat for preview.\n Install jq for importing from / exporting to NewPipe.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/warrior0x7  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm using headphones via jack and stereo speakers via a digital output.\n Under Windows I was/am used to being able to switch between these two devices via the sound icon. Under Arch, however, only one audio device is displayed. \n I can only switch between the audio devices if I change the audio profile in the settings. \n Through trial and error, I was able to determine that the headphones are analog stereo output and the speakers are digital stereo. \n Now to my question: Is this the intended behavior? Or is this an operating error on my part? Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find anything about this \"problem\" in the Arch forum or here and I'm not sure what exactly to look for.\n Is there a way to simply switch between two predefined profiles via the sound icon? \n If that is important: I am using an MSI MAG B550 Tomahawk motherboard\n    submitted by    /u/little_administrator  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone! \n I’ve got 2*1tb NVME, and 2tb SSD.\n I’m aiming to make the most out of my space and really harness the full potential of the 2TB. My plan is to merge the two NVMe drives and set up Debian 12 minimal with GNOME.\n Since I’ll be experimenting and tweaking settings, I’d like to ensure I can revert to a previous state if needed. Ideally, I’d use the 2TB SSD as a reliable restore point to load the OS back to a functioning state.\n Could you guide me on how to achieve this setup? I’m focusing on both performance and having a solid backup solution.\n    submitted by    /u/sassanix  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For a while now, I've been trying to find more up-to-date alternatives based on Debian, so far I've found three of them interesting:\n Kali As it contains a multitude of software focused on cybersecurity, many associate it with activities focused on the same field, this is true, but another truth is the repository is full of useful for a common user and updated software.For gnome lovers, this seems to be the only one, besides Ubuntu, that has a more up-to-date gnome, apart from the fact that Nautilus is outdated for reasons I don't know. Until then, it seems like a better alternative. 1. Imports Debian packages, that is, it has its own repository; 2. It is officially Rolling Release, unlike Debian Testing; and 3. Is maintained by the community;\n Siduction To be honest, I can't say much about this one, but it looks like it's a Rolling Release that uses unstable repositories. It is not so autonomous from Debian that one can even question the reason why use it instead of unstable itself?\n Ubuntu There's not much that can be said, it's an excellent choice. Many who don't recommend Ubuntu do so because of snap, but the truth is Ubuntu is still a great choice even or especially without snap. It's not that it's about hating snaps or not, but if canonical allowed the community to keep .deb versions of the snaps they took down, that would be the best. But users can stay out of these snaps, for example, for FF using the Mozilla PPA, and I'm not a fan of having multiple software sources on the system, it's an easy opening for problems.\n Do you know of another with the following characteristics?: 1. It's a community project; 2. Focuses exclusively on the .deb format; 3. Instead of using direct Debian repositories, import from salsa into it's own repositories; 4. It is released every 6 months or a year, or even is a Rolling Release.\n Tell me in the comments \n    submitted by    /u/ExaHamza  \n [link]   [comments]",

From what I can tell in this image, and correct me if I am wrong, but grub is trying to be installed into nvme0n1p1, which is the EFI partition created by Windows. \n If there's any way to fix this, or any way to fix the initial grub-dummy installation error, please let me know.

I'm curious to hear from people with experience on authoring Debian packages: what steps do you need to take to go from having no experience at all in contributing a package to having it present in future stable versions of Debian?\n Some of you might recognise me as the original author of ALE, and a very small number might know I'm the President & Treasurer of the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organisation that holds the copyright for ALE and other projects, Dense Analysis. I love working on FOSS and will do in some capacity until my last breath.\n I really, really love xmms2 and I've been a regular user of it since around 2010. I was really sad last year when xmms2 just stopped working completely in KDE Neon, and then really happy recently when an update to the packages fixed everything. What's even better is that I wrote what I believe is a very good implementation of MPRIS integration for xmms2, which upon completing a recent update actually continued to fuction stably with zero changes to my code. I previously made a package available via an Ubuntu PPA I still use myself. (Eat your own dogfood.)\n Repeating my initial question, what should I reasonably do to move this package into Debian stable itself in future? I think mailing lists are a very 1990's thing and have always been strange to me, and I'm from 1989 myself. I am very comfortable with IRC, though it's been a while.

          "description": "I have been looking into system backups since rolling back bad decisions is super easy on nixos. A BTRFS file system with a snapshot utility and grub-btrfs seems to be the closest to the nixos implementation from what I read. However that seems to require compiling grub-btrfs from source.\n I have never compiled a tool for my system before. As I understand I would need to try and manually keep up with update the package. Worry about dependencies due to debian having slightly older versions. And making sure to remove them on system upgrade.\n As I want the system rollback because I am trying to learn more about my system while acknowledging I could screw everything up, this seems like a bad idea.\n So I am curious what would the easiest/safest option be? Simply hope that I don't mess anything up too badly so I can get at least get past grub to use a basic timeshift reversion?\n I apologize for being ignorant. Reading into btrfs backups and ext4 rsync backups has gone a bit over my head and I don't want to blindly follow tutorials. So the plan is to find a starting point then try and understand it.\n    submitted by    /u/FroDude258  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I am running into issues after install. I have tried two different types of install (1) graphical install with KDE Plasma installation & other prerequisites as part of standard install and (2) graphical install BUT unticking everything except for \"standard system utilities\". The issue is whether I choose to install KDE Plasma Task via graphical install or install KDE standard via command line, I can't boot into the default kernel running 6.1.0-21-amd64 and gives me a out of memory error. But if I choose Advance Options in grub menu and choose kernel running 6.1.0-18-amd64, I can boot into Debian with no issues. Question - how do I make sure grub menu always selects the 6.1.0-18 kernal and I don't keep having to go Advance Options and manually select it.

Then tried fedora, I actually liked it, but the KDE spin is too bloated and dnf is pretty slow for me even after adding parallel downloads and fastestmirror, even using dnf5, the speeds are really REALLY shitty in my country, I guess it's a mirror and region problem not a dnf one. Besides why does it use so many resources on idle??? 2.8gb RAM, that's literally MORE THAN THRICE of what Arch used, Battery Life was also much worse compared to arch, also those ugly windows-esque offline updates at boot really irked me, although I did turn them off. Throw in RedHat/IBM and the excitement goes away. Finally ended up installing a minimal debian and installing pipewire, ufw etc. and the minimal kde desktop on top of it. Debian is where I'm gonna stay, been using it for 3 months and I love it. The workload on my laptop isn't as intense and debian handles it pretty well (I'm a law student, I just open documents and a web browser, I have no time for tinkering or trying out new stuff.

My TPM is CPU embedded and my server isn't in a shared space.\n I guess my main questions are:\n  \nHow do you go about configuring LUKS to decrypt itself using the TPM?\n What things do I need to do to prevent root access to someone who steals the machine?

I know radvd is often used to work with router announcements etc.\n I'm in the position where I can use prefix delegation with my ISP.\n ​\n So basically, what would I need to do to implement the following:\n  \nI have VLAN's on the lan-side, I want to make sure that some have IPv6 addresses, others don't.\n I want to be able to work with fixed IPv6 addresses, so that I can configure nftables rules like \"this whole vlan has no internet access, however IPv6 address A.B.C.D.E.F in this vlan does have internet access\". Basically, I need to be able to pin hosts to the same addresses every time and use those in nftables rules.\n I would prefer something which isn't depending on my ISP who might change their prefix delegation at some point in time. I'm aware that IPv6 has a range for internal addresses, fc00::/7 address block. If I would need this, how would I implement this? Is this in combination with IPv6 NAT, which doesn't seem recommended?\n If the outcome is that I do need IPv6 NAT'ing: what would be needed to implement this?\n  \n​\n Looking forward to your feedback, I hope there are people on here who have done this before and provide some guidance!\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/jefkebazaar24  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, most dualboot installation guide assume that you're coming from Windows and otherwise advise you to install it first for some reason that it handles disk space differently from linux or whatever... How do I dualboot without reinstalling my debian? I love my install, it's pretty much perfect at this point and I'm afraid that windows will mess with it once I install it just next to debian.
