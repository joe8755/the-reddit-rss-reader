The election processes do indeed finish, upon which point the coordinator process (rank n-1) sends out the ST leader to all GS processes and the GS leader to all ST processes respectively.\n Everything works fine for the ST election and message passing, but for some reason, when the coordinator sends out the GS_ELECT event to all ST processes after the GS leader election, the ST processes do not receive the event. I tried logging the probe's tag, and it is just always START_LELECT_ST and no matter what event is sent afterward, it just never changes the status of the probe, neither with GS_LEADER nor with TERMINATE.\n The relevant ST receiving part is on line 200 of the pastebin source code. I am busting my head trying to figure out why this is happening since if I am not mistaken, MPI_Probe and MPI_Iprobe should be seeing the pending new events and grabbing their tags.\n Any help is greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Najishukai  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all. So, as a challenge to myself to actually start doing projects in C, I decided to make a ncurses-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Part of the logic involves storing the current state in one matrix, and using that to build a second matrix for the next generation's state. Each cycle, the 'next state' (we'll call it m2) becomes the 'previous state' (m1), and my first implementation simply involved looping through the matrices and overwriting each cell of m1 with the corresponding cell of m2. While this works fine, I wanted to do it more \"optimally\" by simply swapping two pointer addresses. This is the function that I came up with:\n void swap_ptr(int (**p1)[ROWS][COLS], int (**p2)[ROWS][COLS]) { int (*tmp)[ROWS][COLS] = *p1; *p1 = *p2; *p2 = tmp; return; } \n The implementation looks like this:\n int matrix1[ROWS][COLS]; int matrix2[ROWS][COLS]; int (*m1)[ROWS][COLS] = &matrix1; int (*m2)[ROWS][COLS] = &matrix2; /* main loop starts, insert Life logic here to populate m2 based on the contents of m1*/ display(*m2); swap_ptr(&m1, &m2); \n This appears to be working fine, but it's not at all like the methods I found online for the same thing, which instead called for something more like:\n void swap_ptr(int ***p1, int ***p2); \n Is there something wrong with the way I'm doing it, or is this just one of those funny C things where there's multiple \"correct\" ways to do something? Thanks in advance!\n EDIT: fixed typos in my code examples.\n    submitted by    /u/XineOP  \n [link]   [comments]",

To stay ahead, I’m planning to deepen my expertise in C programming and explore branches such as embedded programming and advanced uses of C/C++.\n I have a decent handle on solving LeetCode problems and a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms. However, I aim to achieve a deeper understanding of programming and want to have skills that can make me a better developer and a valuable employee.\n I’m here to ask for advice and pointers from those with more experience. Should I focus on C/C++ for embedded systems, or are there other areas within systems programming I should consider? I am also taking a Computer Systems course on the side. I appreciate all the feedbacks I can get - roadmaps, youtube series, project ideas, literally anything.

Do you use something similar, or have a better way of handling errors?\n Here's some example code which can be run in godbolt:\n ​\n #include <stdlib.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdbool.h> #define _STRINGIFY(x) #x #define STRINGIFY(x) _STRINGIFY(x) #define ERROR_STRING(string_literal) \"ERROR in \"__FILE__ \" line #\" STRINGIFY(__LINE__) string_literal typedef struct { bool is_error; union { struct { enum {MakeEggs_error_TemperatureLow, MakeEggs_error_…",

          "description": "I am reading the book \"The C Programming Language,\" an amazing book by the way. In the last chapter about the Unix system, there is a part about building the fopen function with system calls. In this, we use some kind of internal flags, for example, _READ instead of O_RDONLY. In the implementation, it uses both the POSIX and the internal flags. As I understand it, it uses both because in order to detect if some FILE has write privileges, for example, you can intersect bits, and if the intersection is different than 0, it has the privilege. However, this breaks when using O_RDONLY because it has the value 0, so it is not possible to detect if a combination of flags has the O_RDONLY flag with this aproach.\n So my question is, why does POSIX start with 0 instead of 1 and shift the rest by 2*n?\n (Maybe the answer is obvious, but I don't see it.)\n    submitted by    /u/vaquitson  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I have some prior programming experience with C and Python but never managed to go pass the basics. Hopefully I will get to a point where I can do something useful with these languages around this time)\n Nonetheless, I am following the classic \"The C Programming Language\" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. In the introductory chapter (A TUTORIAL INTRODUCTION - Page 6), the first example to print Hello World goes something like this:\n # include <stdio.h> main () { printf(\"Hello, world\\n\"); } \n When I compiled it with the cc or gcc compiler, an error was produced:\n error: return type defaults to 'int' \n Naturally, I went back to the thought process that I had in my previous attempts at learning C. I simply declared the return type for the main() function to be void and it compiled successfully. The changed code goes like this:\n # include <stdio.h> void main () { printf(\"Hello, world\\n\"); } \n What am I missing out from the example? Has it something to do with the Compiler Version that I am on? Or is it something entirely different?\n    submitted by    /u/Desperate_Touch_1918  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there a similar process like this for embedded devices? For example, can GCC generate binaries that are flashed onto embedded devices, or do each embedded device have its own compiler?\n \nSince Linux syscalls generally don't exist on embedded devices, what c functions can I use when programming for embedded?

I feel like I have about 50 terminal tabs open because I'm down the rabbit hole of reading man pages, not complaining because I've found out some super interesting stuff, it just doesn't feel super efficient. \n Let me know if that's just what we do or if you have some other method, I get there's obviously books as well.

          "description": "Hi Everyone,\n I've written a tool at the company I work at that basically allow you to autogenerate any boiler plate code based off a yaml file and a Jinja template schema. At work, we use to tool to autogenerate C++ classes that have built in serialize/deserialize functionality for all kinds of different message classes that we work with. I've also written templates that can autogenerate Protobuf converters that convert a C++ message object to its protobuf equivalent. This has been super handy for us because we work with many different C++ message classes and hand typing all the converters would be tedious and error prone. \n My question is: I am debating making this tool open source, but want to see if other people who write C++ encounter similar problems to this and if a tool like this would be valuable and helpful before I spent a bunch of time re-working it and making it available on GitHub. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ndelgado1    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Log function essentially does this:\n std::cout << std::format(\"{}\\t\\t{}\\n\", LogTypeToString(type), vformat(fmt, args));\n The displaying of the text:\n constexpr auto renderTextSize = sizeof(renderer); Log(LogType::Info, \"{:*^{}} OpenGL Information {:*^{}}\", \"\", 16 + renderTextSize, \"\", 16 + renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, \"* Version : {} ({}.{}) {:{}} *\", version, glVersion[0], glVersion[1], \"\", 26 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, \"* Vendor : {:{}} *\", vendor, 52 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, \"* Renderer : {:{}} *\", renderer, renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, \"* GLSL Version : {:{}} *\", glslVersion, 52 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, \"{:*^{}}\", \"\", 76 - renderTextSize); \n As you may see, since the renderer text seems to be the longest by nature I'm trying to use that as the complete width so that this box shape using \"*\" is always just a space ahead and everything else meets it. I got it to look good with my settings, but I'm wondering how it would look if my information was different. Something tells me it wouldn't make a nice box.\n  \n[Info] ************************* OpenGL Information **************\n [Info] * Version : 4.6.0 NVIDIA 552.22 (4.6)\n [Info] * Vendor : NVIDIA Corporation\n [Info] * Renderer : NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Laptop GPU/PCIe/SSE2 * [Info] * GLSL Version : 4.60 NVIDIA [Info] **********************************************************\n  \nEDIT: It's hard to get it to display here, but basically the first line makes as many \"*\" to the length of the Renderer: text.

Dangerous languages perhaps, but languages that know they are dangerous, and document exactly where the sharp edges are located.\n However, for about a year and a half, I've been branching out and it appears to me that every single language and technology I look at has behaviors that are not defined. They just don't admit to it.\n I opened an issue in docker's documentation because they were missing an explanation for a behavior. Closed as resolved with, paraphrased, \"read the repository if you want to know how docker works.\"\n By that standard, C++ doesn't have undefined behavior either! Just read your compiler's source code and you'll know what happens.\n Same problem with Microsoft's Azure cloud services. Many guides and tutorials but no authoritative source that explains how Azure works, what each option does, and how they interact - or if there is, it's sufficiently burrowed that I've been unable to find it after searching for a while, and their representatives cannot guide me to it either. Dotnet projects? Same issue again, there's any number of properties you can set for your project and you just have to guess from their name what they will do - and don't get me started on the difficulty of writing provably correct golang.\n  \nI can sign for the correctness of C/C++ software. I might be wrong because mistakes happen, but those are mistakes, not lies.\n I cannot sign off on most other software. If I claim that I know something is correct, I am lying. I don't know.

Libraries like CTRE and serialization of any kind would become tremendously easy to achieve in this.\n But I have a feeling that semantics are incorrect and it is not what it appears to be.

This leads to strange inconsistencies in different UIs which might confuse users. Is GTK still the best option for performance reasons?

I'm transferring to a team whose mission is basically: be C++ experts for the rest of the organization. So now I need to know why and how I'm doing what I'm doing.\n What would be the most efficient way to fill in my knowledge gaps? I have gaps in more simple things like the nuances of move semantics, and on the other side of the spectrum I'm pretty unaware of more advanced techniques like metaprogramming beyond the simplest use case. I also need to build a better intuition of how a certain line of code would exactly translate to machine instructions, and fold that intuition into how I write code.\n I've been watching some cppcon videos to start, and I think the next step might be to reread all of the basic C++ books to make sure I fill in all of the more basic unknowns.\n    submitted by    /u/endundefinedbehavior    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Its development team recently wrapped some of its functionality as an unmanaged dll for us so that we can incorporate it into our aspnet based microservice application. Currently we are using .net's foreign function interface (PInvoke) to call the library, however it is a bit fragile and we have to meet a few odd requirements like using a thread with a non-standard max stack size.\n I am thinking maybe I should wrap the api calls in a separate program (probably written in c++) to execute c++ calls that I will run in a separate process and use ipc to communicate. This will probably be a bit more robust as I can recover from process crashes and do not need to implement a producer/consumer queue with a separate thread etc. to schedule api calls. However I also feel like I am overcomplicating things. Did any of you had to deal with a similar problem?

There is a UI to design it then you can generate the QML code, and the user may want to do some modifications on the generated code (I need the code to be well-indented).\n I'm looking for any tips or methods to generate this code and replace placeholders with value.\n Currently, I'm using QString and arg parameters. But I find this solution complex to maintain and the code is kind of ugly.\n One example: The imageField ```cpp bool QmlGeneratorVisitor::generateImage(FieldController* item) { if(!item) return false;\n QString text(\"%4ImageField {//%1\\n\" \"%5\" \"%4 source: %2.value\\n\" \"%4 color: \\\"%3\\\"\\n\" + getPageManagement(item, m_indenSpace) + \"%4 readOnly: %2.readOnly\\n\" + generatePosition(item) + \"%4}\\n\"); m_out << text.arg(item->label()) //%1 .arg(getId(item)) .arg(item->bgColor().name(QColor::HexArgb)) .arg(m_indenSpace) //%4 .arg(m_isTable ? QStringLiteral(\"\") : QStringLiteral(\"%1 id: _%2\\n\").arg(m_indenSpace).arg(getId(item))); return true; \n } ``` %1 -> name of the field %2 -> id of the field %3 -> background color %4 -> indentation space %5 -> generation of the QML id (based on item id)\n Do you have any solution or tips: could be a way to organize or even some libraries…\n https://invent.kde.org/renaudg/rolisteam/-/blob/master/src/binaries/rcse/qmlgeneratorvisitor.cpp?ref_type=heads\n    submitted by    /u/ObiLeSage    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I believe everything is being copied right now so I'm not working with the original object which causes them to constantly be deleted and not be rendered on screen so to fix this I just need the maps to store a smart pointer and the load functions return a smart pointer?\n For future reference is there a way to remember this sort of stuff for example whenever an object is needed outside the scope should I be working with pointers?\n    submitted by    /u/Konjointed    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Raptor provides a set of smart containers (vector, array, vector, scalar) and skeletons (map, reduce, scan, filter, sort) that can be applied over the smart containers. Containers can store the data both on the host (CPU) and device (GPU), and expose a seemingly unified memory address space. Skeletons are executed on the device. Containers are automatically and lazily allocated and synchronized whenever a skeleton is executed.\n    submitted by    /u/dma_snow    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm wondering if shared pointers are the way to go. \n The problem: I have a class that makes an expensive database query during construction. The information retrieved is static though and most of the class functions don't even depend on the data. Furthermore, a class instance might be constructed multiple times during a single call from the upstream application , and each time this expensive and often unnecessary db call is made.\n My idea: Lazy load the db query only when it's first needed and then store the data in a global cache that will exist for the entirety of the application call. I can't control if 10 instances of this class are created, but I can limit to a single db call instead of 10. \n Is a shared pointer amongst the class instances a feasible and a solution here? My understanding is that the a shared pointer to the cache will keep it alive as I need, but I'm unsure how to pass a pointer between the instances like this. I'm also wondering if I'm overthinking the problem and there is a simpler solution I'm not considering.

Given that the standard will likely not be widely supported by compilers until around 2030, I'm interested in using a library that aligns with std::linalg now. This would allow for a seamless transition to std::linalg once it becomes broadly available. \n So far, I haven’t found a library that meets these criteria. I did come across this post, but it wasn’t quite what I needed. If anyone knows of a library that fits this description, I would really appreciate your recommendations.\n Additionally, if anyone is aware of a wrapper for any established libraries like Eigen, Armadillo, BLAS, LAPACK, xtensor, or Blaze that adapts their functionality to align with the proposed std::linalg standard in C++26, I’d be very interested in learning about it. Such a wrapper would ideally allow for easier migration to std::linalg when it becomes standard.

          "description": "Hello everyone.\n I’m relatively new to C++ and have a project im working on. The basis of the project is a basketball game where randomized players and their stats are generated through a draft system then stored into multiple text files. \n I have correlated the players and their attributes using array positions. I have the system set up correctly where I can write the data to the text file and read from it but I am unable to run the code unless I manually go and delete the info from the text file. Only when I do this do the errors disappear.\n It defeats the point if the players stats are not able to be retrieved the first time they were drafted in the game, as I want to be able to implement a save feature where you can pick up where you left off. I have implemented this by creating a main menu, with a switch function, allowing a player to either reset their data by truncating the text files, and undergo the draft process all over again, or continue with the information already in the text file. The issue is however, as I said before, I cannot run this without deleting the data in the file, which I do not want the player to have to do unless they want to reset the game.\n The errors themselves are 2 C2059 errors and Expected a Declaration in the text file themself, which confused me.\n LINK: https://github.com/kvtrey5/BASKETBALL-GAME\n    submitted by    /u/isjupiteramoon    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Both still show a nice improvement --- the decline in average daily layoffs is around 24% on TrueUp and 14% on Layoffs.fyi. Also, I rounded the figures to the nearest 1K.\n TrueUp.io\n  \nThere are 211K open tech jobs today; there were 163K at the March 3, 2023 low. That said, the peak was 478K in April '22\n In 2023, there were 429K people laid off by 2,001 tech companies (an average of 1,175 people/day)\n So far in 2024, there have been 118K people laid off by 540 tech companies (an average of 891 people/day)\n  \nLayoffs.fyi\n  \nIn 2023, there were 263K people laid off by 1,191 tech companies (an average of 721 people/day)\n So far in 2024, there have been 81K people laid off by 287 tech companies (an average of 619 people/day)\n  \nIf it doesn't feel like it's improving, hang in there.

The recruiter had mentioned that I had a week to work on it, and to email him if I had any questions or concerns on it.\n The take home assessment required a lot of time and effort, but I was able to complete it. It took me about a week to complete. \n HOWEVER,\n I found myself reaching out to the recruiter to only get completely ghosted from the recruiter.\n The only acknowledgment I received was an impersonal, automated rejection email that offered no personal communication or constructive feedback.\n The best part: I also found out through the submission platform that my work had not even been reviewed! \n What's the point of asking candidates to dedicate effort to a take-home task if it's going to be IGNORED??? Super disrespectful and unprofessional to request detailed work from candidates and then disregard it entirely.\n I urge potential candidates to be very cautious. Current's hiring approach demonstrates not only a lack of professionalism but also a disregard for basic respect and decency. \n This experience highlighted a profound disrespect and unprofessionalism that prospective applicants should seriously consider before applying!\n    submitted by    /u/Cool-Bird-1958  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are focused on quality, they care about the software and where it is going. Non-technical managers want things done in X amount of time and you need to explain to them like they’re 5 why it hasn’t been done yet. \n How am I supposed to respect someone and essentially report to them when they know nothing about technology? \n These are roles to whip the employees to work harder, slaves overlooking other slaves. They’re there to force devs to give themselves deadlines and burn themselves out. \n Yes, there are also technical managers who aren’t good managers. Imo you need to be both good at management and good at technology, if you’re good at just one of these, you’re automatically not good enough. Your lack in the other area will show up. The definition of a leader, to me, is someone you look up to, who can do at least everything that you do and more. \n This industry is a bit of a joke, not surprised that people can’t take us seriously when we call ourselves “engineers”.

          "description": "Hi, I've been interviewing quite a few people recently for a remote role and noticed most don't bother turning on their camera. It's a bit awkward but I decided to keep mine on anyway.\n Is this very common in your experience?\n I assume they might do it for bias reasons (definitely had women not wanting to get judged because of their appearance and I get that from what I've seen in our field) or just don't feel like it. I didn't push for it as I generally tend to have my team decide by themselves if they turn their camera on during meetings and glad to do as much as possible in Slack. But for a first time meeting people I still find it super hard to... bond with them and then later tell them apart. Or even hire someone without ever having seen their face once.\n Last time I interviewed people for my team a few years ago I didn't notice this, most just seemed to turn on the cam without having it explicitly stated.\n EDIT: \n For the next rounds I'll definitely see that I explicitly state \"video call\". I was just surprised people don't do this by default but perhaps I'm just becoming boomer :). But there's a \"give a talk and we discuss\" round anyway, so I hope at least there they'll turn their cam on.\n I should probably add, this is for a very senior/scientific role, so we also have to meet customers at least virtually, pitch projects, give talks, hold webinars, perhaps go to a conference etc.\n    submitted by    /u/met0xff  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So recently I decided I was going to replace my LinkedIn profile pic since my current one is outdated. While I hadn't yet replaced it I left it blank and suddenly received 2 unsolicited messages from recruiters and 2 responses from other job listings in the span of 1 week. For context, I had spent 6 months and ~800 job apps which I know isn't that many but I haven't even gotten a phone screen. My last and only interview was 6 months ago, where I made it to the final round and was rejected because they had an applicant with more experience than me (I had over 2 YOE and it was a junior role FML). \n Anyway I'm starting to question the timing of these recruiter messages. I don't think there was anything wrong with my profile picture. The only critique I could think of is that it was a bit outdated so I might have looked too young. I don't really want this to turn into a r/RoastMe post so just bear with me and assume I am just an average looking person. \n I think the more likely scenario is that there is some algorithm that LinkedIn uses that detects when users become less engaged on the platform and then decides to rapidly promote that user into reengaging again. This may come across as tinfoil hatty but I do think this is the most likely outcome since the timing does not make any sense and I haven't read anything to suggest the job market suddenly improved a ton. I am curious if other people have had similar things happen to them like this.\n Also an FYI I am a White Male U.S. Citizen with 2.5 YOE in a popular tech stack in a west coast city. \n    submitted by    /u/nysoxfan01  \n [link]   [comments]",

While previous projects have brought many games to a playable state over the years, many audio and visual effects end up getting lost lost in translation. With these recops projects, were now able to get fully intact ports of these games in all their glory with plenty of enhancements as well.\n  \nZelda64 Recomp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywWwUuWRgsM\n  \nWith there now being a healthy interest for N64 from both fans and developers regarding these recent projects, it got me thinking about other consoles such as the OG Xbox and Sega Saturn that also have a troubled history with emulation progress over the years. How cool would it be to have decomp/recomp projects for games like Jet Set Radio Future and Panzer Dragoon Orta?\n For those of you with experience working on such consoles, how feasible do you see this? Is this something that has piqued the interest of anyone in these communities?\n Looking forward to hear what you guys have to say.

Is there a better way to do this?\n Currently I generate an entire frame of audio data and then sending that data to SDL when it renders the video frame (~60 audio frames/sec).

One of it's capabilities will be dissasembly of a PRG ROM. However the thing with these ROMs is that data is mixed up with the code and it can look roughly like this:\n <some data>\n <couple of instructions>\n <some data>\n <couple of instructions> \n And etc. So if you are looking at compiled binary you really have no way of telling whether given byte is treated as instruction, instruction operand (or part of it) or data used by the program.\n I came up with 2 approaches how I could tackle this:\n  \nLazy approach - Just interpret everything as instruction (of course by taking their variable length into account)\n Better approach - Interpret the program, not exactly by executing it but going instruction by instruction, tracking where it jumps or which subroutines it calls. While processing branch instructions process both cases. Read interrupt vectors and interpret them as well until reaching RTS instruction. Everything else would be considered raw data and dead code would also fall into that category. Basically disassembler would go instruction by instruction to determine where code execution can lead to distinguish instructions from the data.\n  \nI never specifically wrote a dissasembler, so I would like to know if my ideas are at least good, or there are better, more reliable approaches to that out there.\n    submitted by    /u/Sea-Work-173  \n [link]   [comments]",

How do you guys usually imagine your code structure beforehand in detail and cleanly. cuz im noticing that I have the same issue at work my philosophy is to think about the task good enough then start implementing as fast as possible so that if I fail, I fail fast and have time to recover, because in my mind there are stuff I wont be able to predict no matter how long I think about it, but my issue is that the amount of things that I cant predict is a lot more than what other developers cant predict, one of those things is overall structure for example (as simple as it may be :) ), so how do you guys approach this sort of tasks, and if you have any advice on how to improve it.\n https://preview.redd.it/9c8g7qcfngyc1.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=333799d98cc775dd6c63fd31b353ac2115c31c04\n    submitted by    /u/ShotAbrocoma4906  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a few services to run, so I’m looking for advice.\n There’s the app built in Expo, which interacts with an API. The API schedules jobs using BullMQ (Which uses Redis), and there’s a lightweight worker that fulfills those jobs (The worker just sends some HTTP requests and interacts with a Postgres database).\n So I have to host - Redis - Postgres (Hosted by Supabase at the moment) - An API (Node) - Worker (Node)\n I was thinking the worker would be a good fit for a serverless function, though I’ve never worked with them.

Or are they saying they should create a copy of their repository in GitLab/GitHub and pay the costs of two providers just to use the pipeline? Currently I'm in a team using Jira and Confluence so I think it makes sense for us to go with BitBucket since code review can easily be done in a way that ties to user stories and it is discounted with our other Atlassian products. Why don't more people that use Jira use BitBucket? And what is the best option for a company using Jira? Do we copy our BitBucket repo to GitLab, do we use GitLab and use a Jira integration but still not have our code review be able to be tied to user stories, or do we use a CI/CD manager like Jenkins which most people agree is complex to manage? What are other people doing for this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/carlordvr  \n [link]   [comments]",

The API is composed of micro-services. It does biz logic things like user management, fetching results, ingesting media inputs and passing them into our core engine which is owned by MLEs... \n We are a small startup, I am the first and only devops engineer at the moment. I initially wrote authorization and owned load balancing into the system but out of feeling that I was spread too thin I passed this ownership off to the fullstack team. My sense over the past few months is that the fullstack team shouldn't ideally own load balancing and authorization, they tend to do things really quickly and dirtily and I suppose I'm not fully comfortable with their approach. My sense is that this should be owned by security minded SREs who are already responsible for production.\n Can you guys assist in providing insight into my potential blindspots?

Also many expect engineers to have software architects skills anyway. So where does that leave the cloud/DevOps architect? I feel there is not much mileage in this path.\n Any others?

          "description": "Hi all,\n Work for an agency so I generally do client work. I've been with my current client for an unusually long time (years) which is my longest term engagement and they're very happy with me. It's a non-tech company in a lucrative industry.\n The work is generally easy but I am the only developer in the organization. As such, the work I do is often glueing their SaaS products together in some way or building small internal tools for my stakeholders. Don't really exercise my dev muscles often and the easiest (least complicated) solution is often the best one for their needs.\n The pay is great and generally the WLB is comfortable, but I don't work with any other devs and really feel my skills deprecating over time. The pay is at the top-end of what my expected range would be like so it's difficult to make a change without taking a pay cut. I worry that whenever this engagement ends (they always do), I will be a much worse dev than I was prior to working here. However, it's hard to not make hay while the sun is shining, so to speak, and just collect the easy money while it's here.\n What would you do?\n    submitted by    /u/htom3heb  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So we have a fairly new CTO thats pushing for various different process changes in dev teams. \n Two of these is trunk based development and full time pair programming to enable CI/CD. \n For context my team looks after a critical area of our platforms (the type where if we screw up serious money can be lost and we'll have regulators to answer to). We commit to repos that are contributed to by multiple teams and basically use a simplified version of Gitflow with feature branches merging into master only when fully reviewed & tested and considered prod ready. Once merged to master the change is released to prod. \n From time to time we do pair programming but tend to only do it when it's crunch time where necessary. The new process basically wants this full time. Devs have trialed this and feel burned out doing the pair programming all day everyday. \n Basically I ran my team on the idea of trunk based development and they're heavily against it including the senior devs (one of whom called it 'madness'). \n The main issue from their perspective is they consider it risky and few others don't think it will actually improve anything. I'm not entirely clued up on where manual QA testing fits into the process either but what I've read suggests this takes place after merge to master & even release which is a big concern for the team. Devs know that manual QA's capture important bugs via non-happy paths despite having a lot of automated tests and 100% code coverage. We already use feature flags for our projects so that we only expose this to clients when ready but devs know this isn't full proof.\n We've spoken about perhaps trialing this with older non-critical apps (which didn't get much buy in) and changes are rarely needed on these apps so I don't see us actually being able to do this any time soon whereas the CTO (and leadership below) is very keen for all teams to take this all on by this summer.\n    submitted by    /u/rjm101  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately there is zero data locality, everything is layered horizontally (persistence service, entity A logic service, entity B logic service, etc) and everything depends on everything else. Services keep each in other sync via synchronous RPC over network. In short, it's a distributed monolith.\n The project has progressed too far to make major architecture changes, and we need to move fast.\n We will soon have the foreseeable issue that keeping state synchronized across multiple distributed services and databases is hard. I shudder to think how the current system would behave during outages, and the many inconsistent states it will get in. I fear that if we don't intervene now, it will turn into a maintenance nightmare on release.\n If you've been in a similar situation, which eventual consistency pattern did you go with, and what was your experience? My main concern is keeping implementation overhead as low as possible. I've thought about the usual at-least-once event-driven + idempotency route, but I'm worried about the overhead during day-to-day development, and amount of changes required to even get started with that. Maybe try 2 phase commits instead?\n If you've been in a similar situation of trying to work with a distributed monolith, I'd be curious to hear what you went with, and what your experience was.\n    submitted by    /u/LizCDR  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Had my 1 on 1 with my manager today. We have had an open for another senior engineer on my team, so I was asking about the status of it. For almost a year I've been a part of a leadership program to help get me promoted to lead. I've gotten a lot of positive feedback along the way and told that I'm making great progress. According to my manager, because of some of the work that we have coming up in the near future 1. that senior role that I mentioned got bumped to lead (we already have a lead) and 2. they made a pitch for me but ultimate was denied by my skip because there's a \"local\" candidate in the pipeline.\n All things considered I'm taking it in stride. I wasn't expecting to be promoted this soon anyway and this unfortunately lines up with the company direction of moving to more in-office / hybrid. There are a bunch of people that were hired (and still are) remote - seniors / leads / principals / managers / directors - one of whom is my manager. Most people still don't go into the office except on rare occasions like vertical get togethers where remote folks fly in too.\n I really enjoy working for the company that I do, so the game plan for now is just to keep kicking butt and make myself undeniable for promo. Looking elsewhere for a lead / staff job has crossed my mind, but I have an agreement with myself that I'll wait until 5 years before doing that (currently sitting at 3 and some change at my current level). Moving back to where the company is based out of has also crossed my mind - I used to live there, but moved back to my home state to be closer to family during the pandemic.\n I'm curious - have y'all run into similar situations? How have you handled it? Also, I have a 1 on 1 with my skip level in a month who denied my promo. Any tips? They're new to me because of a re-org, so it'll be the first time we've met. I've known of them for a while.\n    submitted by    /u/C6H12O6_Ray  \n [link]   [comments]",

My country was very profitable. \n 2018 it is decided that most development work in my country would be moved to India. Our senior developers would now work as architects, product owners and team leads. Most of our great developers decided to jump the ship. I decided to stick around.\n 2018-2020 is a disaster. Everything falls apart. Its so bad that there is a new decision to switch back to 100% inhouse development.\n 2021, its hard to recruit great developers and we need to recruit a lot of people. Management and HR is not happy with the progress, too many candidates fail the technical interviews, its taking too long to sign new employees. It is decided that there will be no technical interviews from now on, HR will handle 100% of the recruitment process. Focus on \"soft values and skills\".\n 2022, it is still a disaster. We have signed a lot of new emoloyees, most with wrong skillsets due to HR having no clue about what we need. We needed senior software developers and we got database admins, sysadmins, service desk agents etc that wanted to get into software development. \n 2024, we are still in a very bad state, and guess what? The solution is to move development to India again. The history repeats. \n I should obviously jump the ship, i used to be a developer, now i just spend my time in crisis meetings, escalations, red alerts, meetings with management etc. However i find this mess to be very entertaining.

Basically you tell them, we need to do C and to get there we need to build A and B. He then goes and builds E, F, G, H and then finally C. You tell him that that’s not how we usually do things, and then they asks you to write the requirements for it, and they will make sure that C matches those requirements… I don’t think anyone else on the team would be able to contribute to this project or support it, which is almost like a legacy service being brand new.\n They don’t get involved in any of the other tasks the rest of the team does, but constantly requires time from everyone to review their PRs. They also started getting very involved with other teams organizing lunch and learns, presentations, discussions and trying to get buy-in from other teams in how they do things.\n This individual is a very smart person and I don’t doubt his technical skills.. but is really a pain to work with him.

Little did I know, they were about to announce a funding round, invalidating the previous strike price and the strike price that I would receive has tripled (which I have not yet been granted). Sure I still get X # options however they are now at 3x the strike price. This means that instead of paying say $200k to exercise my options I have to pay $600k if I ever want to exercise (with the risk that it becomes potentially be worthless if it never IPOs).\n Given that I don't see the company realistically going IPO until at least 5+ years, this means if I leave before then I will have to either shell out a large amount of money or just leave my stake on the table. If I just leave it on the table then it only makes financial sense for me to stay at the company the amount of time equal to the amount of options I am willing to exercise.\n Has anyone else joined in the middle of a raise unknowingly and are there other solutions?

I'm going through some existential crisis and just felt like writing it out.\n I've been a developer for around 14-15 years and have worked on a lot of different tech and systems and have a good breadth of knowledge i'd say. \n But i've never really worked on anything with huge amounts of data or low latency requirements or extremely high throughout etc. Have always worked in big orgs and on systems with moderate non-functional specs and lots of business features. Historically i've not been into developer communities or open source contributions (earlier in career due to lack of awareness and now due all sorts of stuff including lack of motivation to do this outside work hours). I'm trying to change this a bit recently by getting more involved in communities in my company.\n Having said that within my teams i've always got good remarks, hikes and considered as a solid all-round senior. Pay was always good and I mostly enjoyed my work (was almost too grateful to even be hired as a SWE at the start). I also keep myself quite updated even though most of that knowledge stays mostly theoretical.\n As I evaluate my career i wonder if I should have seeked out more challenging work? There seems to be an expectation that after all these years one would have atleast tackled some hard technical challenge and I cant seem to think of any. Slowly starting to feel if i'm actually good to even handle anything challenging now and that's not helping my confidence to even look for such opportunities. What if I get an opportunity and fail?\n Just wondering if others have gone through such a phase and found their peace somehow? Or any advice on how to position myself for the next 15 years of my career? \n    submitted by    /u/rchan88  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Maybe a better thing to ask would be: how do you ensure you’re recognized for the products of your work?\n I’ve had a strange problem for a while now: despite putting in the same hours as my coworkers, and being very productive in terms of tickets, I have for years now been receiving the feedback that I should work with more urgency, and should try to get things done faster. I genuinely do not slack off at all, but the fact that I keep receiving this feedback (and that it has followed me between companies) indicates to me that I’m clearly at least doing a poor job of representing myself.\n For example: once, after a particularly rough sprint a manager had a version of this conversation with me, and we pulled up metrics, and over the course of that sprint I’d completed more tickets than anyone else on the team, and had completed the same number of “urgent” tickets as the rest of the team combined. (And it’s not as though I just pick easy tickets to pump my numbers)\n In one-off situations like that it’s easy to be like, look, I’m sorry I’m giving off this appearance, but if we look at the actual work that got done I think it’s clear I’m pulling my weight… but it’s really not a conversation I enjoy having over and over. Instead I’d really like to just not give off that appearance in the first place.\n    submitted by    /u/aahOhNoNotTheBees  \n [link]   [comments]",

I explained to him that we didn't have requirements for that and because of differences in the implementation, they wouldn't really work for this customer.\n On Friday he emailed the customer and asked them if they were planning on flowing us new requirements for the features that we discussed because it would make the tool much better. He didn't copy me, but the customer emailed back, copying me, and said they were considering it. I replied that we could discuss it, but gave the reasons why it wouldn't be a good idea for them.\n They also copied our management and our director came and yelled at me for \"requirements fishing\" - someone at the customer felt we were trying to increase the scope to inflate the contract value. To be honest, my reply wasn't the best (I didn't think it through enough and I can see why they might have thought we were coordinating)\n I'm pissed, if I were management, I'd fire him.

          "description": "I've been living in a VHCOL city on the west coast for the past few years, working as a software engineer. My company has an office out here, but announced recently they're closing it at the end of the month, after which I'll be fully remote.\n I don't particularly care for the city I live in, and thought that remote work would be a great opportunity to move to a larger city with more energy, namely NYC. I've been floating this idea around my team since the announcement of the closure was made, and haven't gotten any negative feedback around it, so I felt pretty confident about the topic when I officially asked my boss if I could move to NYC after I become fully remote.\n He got back to me a few days later (after speaking with HR), and said that a move is totally doable, if I take a $50k pay cut in my TC. I was pretty floored at this request, especially since by any metric NYC is more expensive than where I currently live, but the rationale is that the pay bands in NYC are ostensibly lower for my job compared to my current city.\n I'm wondering, is this level of pay cut common for a move from the west coast to NYC? It seems totally unreasonable to me, especially after looking at jobs at some of the other tech companies operating out of NYC. Many of these companies actually explicitly state that their pay bands are identical for NYC and the city I live in currently.

          "description": "I heard this metaphor a long time ago. I forget where and from whom. I also forget exactly how it went, but the basic idea was this. Developers are going to want to build their sandcastles. And the idea I think it was trying to express was the desire of software developerss to build the most complete, robust, and elegant solutions they could engineer for the problems they are trying to solve.\n Sometimes this may be good, but the context I think I remember the metaphor in was that of, \"project managers are necessary otherwise develops will never make progress towards a end goal, with endless scope creep and analysis paralysis\". Thinking about it now, I think this metaphor was being used in reference to the video game industry when I heard it.\n This post is two part, firstly, and mostly for my curiosity, I was hoping you all who are familiar with this expression could remind me exactly how it goes and provide your take on it.\n Secondly, I would like to start a discussion on the topic. At work, I don't really seem to face this issue that often. But when working on a personal project, I seem to almost never get very far because I get stuck in this trance where I am trying to over engineer the first problems I come across with any amount of complexity. For example, I have tried writing a vulkan renderer multiple times now, and each time I get stuck on trying to build a thesis on device and queue selection, coding for every use case that I can imagine, when in reality I only need one or two simple methods for accomplishing this task.

          "description": "Apart from using an actual debugger - in some cases you can’t have a debugger attached to the process, or the behavior you’re facing is complex and emergent, and you cannot just put a breakpoint or log statement there. If attaching a debugger is possible, then of course I just attach a debugger.\n Let me share mines:\n  \nIsolate - if something’s tricky, try to have the simplest isolated reproduction that you can have. This cuts out unnecessary complexity and usually also speeds up iterations.\n Isolate early - it’s tempting to think that “I just need to fix this here, redeploy and it’ll probably work”, but I found that more often than not, I should have isolated the case earlier. It’s balancing between the likelihood of fixing it in place in a couple of iterations with a longer cycle and between investing time upfront in the isolation to have shorter feedback cycle. Also, the skill of efficiently isolating cases is something that improves with practice.\n “Approach from two ends” - I’m not sure if this has a name, sometimes it can be called ‘binary search’. When I tried everything that I could think of but it all doesn’t seem to make any sense, then I step back and try to ‘brute force’ it. This usually starts by taking my problematic case on one end, and a known working example of what I’m trying to achieve on the other end. Then I start modifying on both ends: stripping down parts on the first end, and adding more and more parts on the other end, so that they become more and more similar. At some point, the difference that I didn’t think of pops out. A similar approach also works for example if a new release of an app has a regression, but it’s not clear from the code change why - then we can start producing synthetic approximation releases in a test environment to see where exactly things break. I really like this approach, it really helped me solve cases where I had no idea why things don’t work.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/my_dev_acc  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm currently developing a prison-escape game, basically very similar to \"The Escapists\" but in a low-poly 3D setting. The steam shop page exists for a few months, not resulting in many wishlists, which I would expect for a hobby project without marketing (except for a few YouTube shorts (~100-400 views each)).\n So the daily wishlists were around 0-1, mostly 0. Then, a few days ago, I checked the tags again, and compared them to the tags to \"The Escapists\", since the gameplay is pretty similar.\n Here is my little/big fuck-up: The tag I initially set with the highest priority is (in german) \"Ausbruchssimulation\", which can also be understood as a game where you/the player has to break out of somewhere. I was kinda wondering why \"The Escapists\" is not tagged with the same tag, as I would imagine it is the most fitting for this kind of game.\n I looked at the games that were tagged with \"Ausbruchssimulation\", saw stuff like Pague Inc. etc., and had an epiphany: changed the language to english, \"Ausbruchssimulation\" is the translation for \"Outbreak Sim\".\n Yeah, so i removed the tag and (at least for the four days since) this also had an impact on daily wishlists: https://ibb.co/GHgBXxh\n    submitted by    /u/projectbreakout  \n [link]   [comments]",

Well, it’s a significant aspect of the game where you defend your base and earn Tech Points to unlock new technology in your tech tree. However, it’s not a necessity; you can choose to farm your own way, explore, or complete contracts to obtain technology. The game also supports multiplayer.\n Teaser:\n In the teaser footage, I’m showcasing some of the environments, gathering mechanics, alien life, points of interest, combat, player base interactions, character movement, overall feel, and theme of the game.\n Feedback:\n I’d like to hear your thoughts on all these aspects, including the graphics.\n Development Teaser [on the Steam page]:\n https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800450/Planetaries/\n Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Jaarekt22  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm actually not joking, If I had a time machine to 15 years ago, sigh\n Though if the hubris does overwhelm, pick an easier game genre, Something one person can do, no matter how brilliant you think you are, you really are not. Still it could of been worse I could of chosen a MMORPGGGGGH\n Don't make a major gameplay change midway (I done 2 on this game adventure, turn based -> realtime & dungeons -> Open World). Lesson learnt, If the game ain't happening, scrap it and start something new, don't try to shoehorn what you have into this cause it will bite you in the ass later \n Don't roll your own code. i.e re-invent the wheel, Sure this is oldhat advice. But take it from an oldfart, dont. I went from my own engine in c++/opengl & my own physics engine -> my engine + ODE -> Unity & C#. I wasn't cool rolling my own, I was just a dick wasting hours, hours that could of been useful realizing my dream \n  \nPositive advice:\n  \nOnly 2 rules in programming\n #1 KISS - Always keep it simple, you may think you're smart doing some shortcut or elegant solution, but 50% of the time you're creating problems down the track, why roll the dice, play it smart. OK this is a mantra but #2 is not well known\n #2 Treat everything as equal. AKA - don't make exceptions, no matter how much sense they appear to make, inevitably it will bite you in the ass later\n Now I still violate both the rules even now (after 40 years of programming) So this is do as I say, not as I do thing\n Don't be afraid to go out of your comfort zone. Myself, In the last couple of years, I've (with my GF) had my child, something I swear I would never do (It happened though) & gone to help in Ukraine.

The best thing to do is take notes. You know who isn't going to care about the \"design\" excuse? The person who leaves a negative review on Steam complaining about the same issues. The best outcome is that your playtester comes to that conclusion themselves.\n Playtester: \"The movement feels very stiff, but those restrictions make the moment-to-moment gameplay more intense. Kind of reminds me of Resident Evil 1, actually.\"\n That's not to say you should take every piece of feedback to heart. Absolutely not. If you truly believe clunky movement is part of the experience and you can't do without it, then you'll just have to accept that the game's not for everyone.\n The best feedback is given when you don't tell your playtester what to think or feel about what they're playing.

I’d love for you to try it out and share any feedback or suggestions!\n Future Plans:\n I am planning to develop a version in GDScript based on community interest.

          "description": "Introduction\n repo\n This is a proof of concept/Prototype\n Almost a year ago, I started working on a GDScript compiler. And then stopped because getting GDExtensions to work (even in C) was a pain (because it's not documented). This was my first time using rust, so the code was kinda bad. \n I have revisited the project, but it's a bit different now. Instead of using LLVM to generate machine code, I generate rust, because if I can use rust I will (even for shaders). \n And with help of gdext, I won't have to deal with GDExtensions.\n Benchmarks\n The rust version (without optimizations) can run 5 times faster in this case nth Fibonacci number.\n  GDScript: 390 ms Rust: 77 ms \n (Code for the benchmark can be seen in addon/bench.gd)\n Features\n  \nFunction\n Calling functions in the same file\n Math\n for loops\n while loops\n if\n variables\n Addon\n maybe I missed something else\n  \nLimitations\n  \nUsing other Nodes.\n calling function outside the file\n Can generate wrong rust code\n And a lot more\n  \nFAQ\n Why rust?\n I like it.\n Will this make normal GDScript obsolete?\n No, GDScript is really nice to debug. And fast to iterate.\n Why is GDScript slow?\n IMO, I think the main problem is loops, it's something that any interpreted language fears.\n Why not make a JIT?\n While it will be better for dynamically typed language like GDScript, but it will be harder to implement. Oh, and JIT's won't work on IOS.\n Why not use rust or c++ direly\n Debug in Godot, run with rust. GDScript is easy to debug for normal people, for compiled languages you need to use lldb or gdb.\n Future\n  \nbeg Godot devs for --script-dump-ast\n Better codegen (this that takes AST and makes rust source code)\n Improve the add-on.\n  \nI won't be working on this for some time. Writing a parser is only fun the first time, not 2 times + other failed attempts with parser generators. Basically, nothing will be done until --script-dump-ast, and then maybe I will continue.\n Maybe this will revive this issue.\n    submitted by    /u/ssd-guy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not sure why they died out, maybe it was a programming fad.\n I can't help feeling it might be a good fit for the Godot community though. It allows more experienced devs to flex their muscles and show off, while more novice level people can take notes.\n I'm not talking about long challenges, such as making games/prototypes, but more specific stuff. \n Here's an example of Python challenges for comparison. That list goes from beginner level to hard, but there's no reason we have to vary the difficulty by that much.\n    submitted by    /u/sundler  \n [link]   [comments]",

Godot 4.2 will still default to 6.0, but you can edit your .csproj file to change this.\n \nBelieve it or not, you can use full native AOT compilation with C# in Godot projects. That's right: no more virtual machine IL interpreting JIT nonsense. Real machine code. Interpreted languages require too much imagination.\n \n Set it up like below, and you can completely ditch the CLR runtime and its dependencies for your game and get considerable performance gains.

They knew full well that they didn't meet the system requirements, but wanted to try it anyway. Turned out the game ran pretty awfully on Proton because of their hardware, the framerate skipped wildly around, their progress kept getting wiped out, and certain textures either didn't load or popped in after several minutes.\n I had put off building for Linux until I could boot it up myself on an old PC, so I spent the day trying to debug the issue with them and figure out if there were certain settings that could improve their experience.\n In the end, we couldn't find any fixes. So I took a leap of faith, put all my chips on Godot and just blindly built a Linux version for them without testing it, figuring it probably wouldn't work but was worth a shot.\n It worked PERFECTLY, first try, no issues.\n Love this engine, love you guys. Shown above is me and the new player absolutely dumbfounded by Godot effortlessly taking care of business.\n    submitted by    /u/AuraTummyache  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm new to Golang, and trying to build an app that uses 3rd party APIs on behalf of the user. I've seen in the documentation that you should always reuse the clients in order to take advantage of existing HTTP connections. At first, that looks pretty straight forward: initiate a new client at start time, attach it to the server struct and access the client from anywhere, like a singleton.\n Now, say I have a Gitlab client that sends requests on behalf of an user which has provided an access token. I cannot initiate the client at start time and reuse it (setting the token before calling the api) because I could have race conditions where an user ends up with the token from someone else, so sharing an authenticated client seems like a no go. \n I think I could create a client per http request, making it unique per client, but then if I only make one call to gitlab per request it's the same thing as never reusing the client.\n Do I make sense? How should I go for such use cases?\n    submitted by    /u/Key_Climate5857  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to understand why this is the case.\n I understand that the sort interface needs to be implemented along with Push and Pop. From my newbie POV it seems that the reason why other languages only require a comparator is because priority queue's in Java and C++ are able to provide a concrete heap implementation through generics? So is this a vestige of pre-generics Go?\n I'd appreciate any discussion as to why this was the choice taken, as I'm hoping to get a better understanding of Go and become more gopher :).\n    submitted by    /u/aclinical  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was just rejected from a role after completing a take home assignment writing a simple RESTful API for a microservice managing one resource. The position was a Golang position (which I admittedly have no experience in) but the assignment did not have to be written in Go. I decided to write it in Go anyways because:\n  \nI would need to learn the language if I were to be hired for the position anyways.\n \nIt would be nice to learn a new language and it's ecosystem even if I were to be rejected.\n \n So I poured my heart into learning Go and some select frameworks. I honestly thought I did well enough on the assignment considering it's my first real attempt to write something in Go that isn't absolutely trivial. I was not given any feedback for where I went wrong so I'm left in the dark here. Can any of you give me some feedback on my code? Really appreciate the time.\n https://github.com/brandonto/rest-api-microservice-demo\n EDIT:\n I'd like to thank you all for the enormous feedback. It's heavily appreciated. Never thought that I would have received so much in such a short time frame. I think I have a clear understanding of where the weak points lie now for future projects. I'll definitely be incorporating some of the suggestions in future projects. Perhaps even make changes to this one for the sake of completeness.\n As for the job, while I am a bit disappointed after sinking in hours into this project, I'm just treating it as part of the learning experience.\n I probably won't have the time to respond to any new comments.

In the Python world, I was used to riding on the shoulders of giants. Python frameworks usually provide built-in tools for authentication—everything from password validation and encryption to token expiration and third-party logins.\n Now, as I start developing my first API with Go Chi1, I've noticed the prevalent advice is to implement features from scratch. This shift has left me anxious about potential missteps and the risk of creating an insecure application.\n Do you all build auth from scratch when using Go Chi, or are there trusted libraries you rely on? How do you manage the complexity and ensure security? \n 1 Choosing Chi over the many other \"expressive, lightweight, API router\" was already a tough dilemma (and still I don't know if I chose the right tool).

I started telling her how files don't intrinsically \"mean\" something and that programs simply do something with the bytes.\n For instance, an image utility assumes that if there is a file.png somewhere and its internal binary layout follows the PNG conventions then it must be an image and it will display that image on screen interpreting the bytes as RGBA values. However, other programs may interpret these same bytes differently and do other things with them.\n To demo that concept in the most obvious way, I created snapsound - a CLI (for now) that allows you to transform any MP3 file into a PNG image but retain the ability to play back the original sound. It's as simple as\n snapsound snap song.mp3 # Creates song.png snapsound play song.png \n If you're curious, the code is completely open source on GitHub. It can be easily installed with go intall.\n As a summation of this little research effort, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it is to write a program that plays sound in Go! The only thing is, I think that github.com/gopxl/beep (one of the deps) requires CGo to build on Linux, but MacOS and Windows are pure Go, no need for anything else (already tested both).\n    submitted by    /u/sharpvik  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I've written pktstat-bpf, a simple replacement for ncurses/libpcap-based pktstat, using Linux eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) program, allowing packet statistics gathering even under very high traffic volume conditions, typically several million packets per second even on an average server. In this scenario (high volume, DoS attacks etc.) typically regular packet capture solutions start being unreliable due to increasing packet loss.\n By default it uses TC (Traffic Control) eBPF hooks with TCX attaching requiring at minimum Linux kernel v6.6 for both ingress and egress traffic statistics. Alternatively it can switch to XDP (eXpress Data Path) hook but with a consequence of losing egress statistics since XDP works only in ingress path. XDP mode due to XDP program to network interface attaching calls requires at minimum Linux kernel v5.9. Some distributions might have backported XDP/TC patches (notable example is Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel) and eBPF program might work on older kernels too.\n When using XDP on SmartNICs (100GE and more) it is possible to run in XDP Offloaded mode where XDP program loads directly on NIC with hardware XDP support and executes without using CPU, allowing wire speed statistics even on 100+Gbps speeds.\n At the end of the execution program will display per-IP and per-protocol statistics sorted by per-connection bps, packets and (source-IP:port, destination-IP:port) tuples, either in plaintext or as JSON.\n Program consists of the eBPF code in C and the pure-Go userland Golang program that parses and outputs final IP/port/protocol/bitrate statistics. Go part of the program uses wonderful cillium/ebpf library to load and run eBPF program, interfacing with eBPF map.\n I would be glad to hear about any improvements, bugs or otherwise. File an issue or ping me in the comments. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/kreatormoo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Can the same exploit be executed if the vulnerable c program runs on a different machine? Will memory addresses be the same?\n I think the answer is no they probably won´t even be the same when running only in the same environment and on the same machine. There is nothing like a guarantee that it will have the same address.\n A modern-day OS assigns the memory arbitrarily (within certain sections of course). This technique is called Address Space Layout Randomization. Also gcc or clang uses the --fstack-protector that prevents buffer overflow attacks\n Hence, my final question confuses me and make no sense for me based on this video is how geohot manage to exploit a buffer overflow attack remotely if addresses would not the same.

I can post some blurred out shots \n    submitted by    /u/Alive-Kaleidoscope63  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I recently lost my job. I didn't particularly like it, so it's not sad in that sense; however, the financial implications are obviously less than ideal.\n I've been interested in cybersecurity for a long time and even took the CompTIA Security+ certification a few years ago just for fun, but that is the extent of my relevant experience. I want to use this as an opportunity to upskill myself and finally break into a field that I am genuinely passionate about, and I do not mind starting from the bottom. I have enough saved that I can go at this full time, 8-10 hours a day, for the next 4 months. Importantly, I have basically no other commitments.\n I have outlined a plan:\n  \n Month 1: TryHackMe + HTB boxes with walkthrough to get the basics down and document all progress. \n Month 2: Study for and take the PNPT (can't afford the OSCP), continue with HTB and THM. \n Month 3: Renew Security+ cert and start applying for tons of jobs, keep going at it with HTB and THM. \n Month 4: Keep applying, and hopefully get some interviews, and keep doing the same stuff and document all progress. And if I get no results maybe try my luck in Bug Bounty hunting.\n  \nI know this is a massive undertaking, and I realize it's going to be a tough few months. But I've always seemed to learn quickly, and I'm very committed to making this happen.\n I would greatly appreciate any feedback, critique, and advice that could help me in my journey.\n    submitted by    /u/DimWit666  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "With the newest set of bugfixes, the experimental Rust to .NET compiler backend is coming closer and closer to being usable!\n The std built by the project is now functional enough to handle things like creating/writing to files, and writing to stdout / stderr.\n This small snippet of Rust code:\n use std::io::Write; fn main(){ println!(\"Hello from Rust to .NET!\"); std::fs::File::create(\"/tmp/rust_on_dotnet.txt\").unwrap().write_all(b\"Hi from Rust, .NET\").unwrap(); eprintln!(\"We are writing to stderr!\"); } \n Can now run without issues within the .NET runtime!\n While this week has been a bit busy for me (first 3 final exams), I still made some progress in other areas too.\n Besides this, I have also eliminated 2 memory corruption errors (one related to closures, one related to small constant values). Those issues were found using valgrind - a memory debuting tool, which I now use to verify the Rust code compiled for .NET behaves correctly (the runtime can run under valgrind, if the right flags are set).\n I have also finished a round of extensive fuzzing (46 434 773 LOC of MIR test programs), which allowed me to find and patch many other issues (mostly related to floating-point numbers).\n Some issues still remain (13 out of 10 000 generated tests still fail, and the fuzzing tool I use does not check for every kind of bug), but a lot more Rust code should now compile properly.\n There is still a lot of work to do, but I wanted to share some of the progress.\n Also, the project has reached 1024(2^10) stars on GitHub! So, I would like to thank people for the amazing reception my project has had!\n If you have any questions/suggestions/whatever, feel free to ask.\n    submitted by    /u/FractalFir  \n [link]   [comments]",

I always thought this is just how terminal apps are like, and not much can be done about that. Ranger is written in Python.\n Then I discovered yazi (https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) which is similar to ranger but it's blazing fast and snappy. It's written in Rust.\n The functionality of these apps is pretty similar, but the snappyness of yazi yet again reminds me how fast and rock solid Rust programs could be. I just don't understand why that's the case though—it's not like these apps do heavy number crunching or systems programming; they essentially provide a skin around terminal utilities such as ls and cd. Why is yazi so so faster then?\n    submitted by    /u/nderstand2grow  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The dbg! macro is awesome, but I almost always use println! instead. I lose inline convenience and the automatic label, but I just can't stand pretty printing.\n When I'm trying to print the context of some execution, I'm usually expecting a ton of repetitive text. I find this way easier to read when parallelized; just painless to pattern match, scan over, and read across dimensions. The patterns are automatically provided to you, they're just there.\n What I want is this:\n [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 10] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 1] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 2] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 3] [src\\comb.rs:1260:3] count = [7, 0] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 4] // .. \n versus\n [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 10, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 1, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 2, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 3, ] [src\\comb.rs:1260:3] count = [ 7, 0, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 4, ] // .. \n This is actual dbg! output from my program, which also demonstrates how pretty printing can even be unnecessarily confusing. The lines [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count and [src\\comb.rs:1260:3] count are very similar, but in the single-line example it's much easier to spot the odd one out.\n I can copy-paste the source code into my own macro, but for a debug tool that I'd wanna use everywhere and anywhere it's just not the same. Is there an environment variable or some way to disable pretty printing everywhere? I've searched, but found none.\n Either way, curious to hear your thoughts on pretty printing for debug output.\n Your dearest friend,\n Yokin\n    submitted by    /u/Y0kin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Moreover, std Backtrace brings a lot of unrelated intermediate stacks and increases a significant runtime overhead.\n Our solution is built upon snafu, which is like a combination of thiserror and anyhow, with less than 1% runtime overhead and binary size.\n Check it out the blog for the design, implementation, and how it can benefit you: https://greptime.com/blogs/2024-05-07-error-rust\n    submitted by    /u/tison1096  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I recently started learning Rust and wanted to share my experience to encourage others who might be hesitant about its perceived difficulty. The notion that Rust is a tough language puts people from even trying, including my past self. This is particularly relevant for those who, like me, have primarily worked with GC'd languages (I've only ever completed one semester course in C++ and never used it professionally).\n For me, the learning curve for Rust wasn't as steep as it was for other programming paradigms I've used extensively, such as logic or pure functional programming. It only took me an evening or two to get somewhat comfortable with Rust, and within a week I was able to finish the book and complete a couple of projects. What made the transition smoother was the excellent \"onboard…",

          "description": "ctreg (pronounced cuh-tredge) is a library for compile-time regular expressions the way they were always meant to be: at compile time! It's a macro that takes a regular expression and produces two things:\n  \nA type containing the compiled internal representation of the regular expression, or as close as we can get given the tools available to us. This means no runtime errors and faster regex object construction.\n A type containing all of the named capture groups in the expression, and a captures method that infallibly captures them. Unconditional capture groups are always present when a match is found, while optional or alternated groups appear as Option<Capture>. This is a significant ergonomic improvmenet over fallibly accessing groups by string or integer key at runtime.\n  \nInterestingly, we currently don't do any shenanigans with OnceLock or anything similar. That was my original intention, but because the macro can't offer anything meaningful over doing it yourself, we've elected to adopt the principles of zero-cost abstractions for now and have callers opt-in to whatever object management pattern makes the most sense for their use case. In the future I might add this if I can find a good, clean pattern for it.\n This version is 1.0, but I still have plenty of stuff I want to add. My current priority is reaching approximate feature pairity with the regex crates: useful cargo features for tuning performance and unicode behavior, and a more comprehensive API for variations on find operations.\n    submitted by    /u/Lucretiel  \n [link]   [comments]",

What's the current limitations? I can imagine countless benefits to using it over javascript, but are there any drawbacks to using rust for it over javascript? \n ​\n I know absolutely nothing about it, and my web dev knowledge overall is extremely rusty and likely outdated. But are you somehow working with frameworks like react but with rust? Or bindings? CSS?

          "description": "I switched my primary language from C/C++ to rust around 5 years back. I have been interviewing lately for a job change. Most of the interviews were 45 min affairs, solving Leetcode style problems (why ?? - that is a separate discussion).\n Sadly, I have come to realize rust is not ideal for this scenario, and going to switch back to C for these coding rounds. Most of these interviews involved working with 2D arrays, linked list, binary trees and such which would be relatively simple in C/C++.\n More context: I have had to spend a good part of the 45 min setting up these primitives, before even trying to solve the core algorithmic challenge. Few reasons:\n  \nThings like coderpad don't let you use external crates (e.g) there is one for 2D arrays\n Some questions involve removing elements from middle of lists in O(1) time. I had to hand roll a doubly linked list with unsafe pointer usage to achieve that, which itself easily filled the time\n  \nWith C/C++, these interviews used to go lot better, uh. Now I think: use C/C++ for interviews, rust for product development. Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/rusty_rouge  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's entirely written in Rust and orders of magnitude simpler than comparable ML frameworks.\n Recently we've been working on speeding up performance on Nvidia and Apple GPUs, which led us to write compilers capable of generating kernels on the fly. These kernels are compiled once and ran many times, and since the whole compute graph is known at compile time, we can get very aggressive with the kernel optimizations.\n We're adding tons more features (autograd landed a few weeks ago, so training is now possible!) so check out the blog post and the repo if you'd like to know more!\n    submitted by    /u/jafioti  \n [link]   [comments]",

Lately I just avoid adding async at all costs because it just comes with so many caveats and gotchas that the effort is sometimes not worth the performance improvement. Some of the things that I absolutely find annoying:\n  \nasync is not part of rust, it's a library. The main one being Tokio with no real alternative. I applaud the work done on this but it all just feels horribly hacky. \n \nany time you have to use async you taint all your functions and types with it. As if dropping a bucket of paint (worse than paint but let's keep it civil) all over your code. It makes refactoring a horrible experience. As you crawl your codebase to make it async you eventually end up with an impossible task and have to find ugly alternatives (looking at you async fn in traits)\n \nwhile the rust compiler has been an amazing tool along the journey, it just fails miserably with async. It won't complain at all if you forgot to remove a blocking fs call in an async context and of course it will fail horribly at run time. And when the program eventually crashes, it will just render the most obscure stacktrace i've ever seen. FAR from the developper experience of vanilla Rust.\n \n Overall for such a great language with so many features, it just feels broken as soon as you put your finger in the async business. I ve been looking at the async improvement proposals but apart from async fn traits, i just don't see anything revolutionary that would make the experience better. \n At some point, shouldn't it just be part of the language if async Rust is to improve in a major way ? \n Disclaimer: I am not a Rust expert, but i ve been programming for 25+ years in many different languages.\n    submitted by    /u/ArnUpNorth  \n [link]   [comments]",
