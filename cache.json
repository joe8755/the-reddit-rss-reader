I only really got into use of function pointers when I moved away from C++.\n Update: As luck would have it I also just thought of a kind of table, actually more like a tree, which simply fetches the successive indices at each state/input intersection within an array; index 0 and every nth one after it being a \"state\" and all other entries being \"inputs\", which simply store the virtual addresses of the next state to enter.

However, I've run into a problem that I can't really wrap my head around. If I try moving the cursor to the end of a line with tabs, the cursor will stop too early. Therefore, I thought maybe I should replace the tab characters for each line of the file, but then I remembered Vim. Vim can change the 'shiftwidth' of the tab character (i.e 8 spaces get turned into 2 spaces according to the shiftwidth variable) without directly affecting the line itself! So I'm wondering how I can implement this in my own program and allow the cursor to adjust to the tab size?\n For reference, here's the source code for my program if anyone's interested: https://github.com/MoolsDogTwo/Centi\n Buffer & cursor functions are in their respective c & h files.

All threads share some global variables which are primarily used for signaling, the simplest example being a boolean flag which signals a global shutdown. Only one thread (the server) will ever write to this flag, and once set it remains set until all threads return, but many threads will read it many times in a hot loop before this happens, so I'd like to optimize those reads as much as possible.\n I'm fairly new to multi-threaded programming, but from what I've read, data races are primarily caused by one thread reading after the write has begun but before the write has finished, causing partially written data to be read. However, in this case it is a single byte being written, only one thread is the writer, only the transition from 0 to 1 needs to be detected, and that detection doesn't need to be perfectly synchronized between threads because the value will stay the same until all threads have reacted to it.\n I can't see a way that anything bad will happen if I just use a non-atomic bool, but again, I'm new to this and I don't want to introduce a subtle bug that might bite me suddenly down the line; every relevant search result I've found says to always use atomic operations by default, but they're using more complex data types. I can't imagine how a bool can ever be in a partially updated state so I feel fairly safe using a non-atomic bool, but is there something I'm missing? And if a non-atomic bool is safe, at what point does a non-atomic one-writer many-readers variable become unsafe? I imagine that depends on architecture (data bus size, etc.), so should I just assume anything larger than a bool requires atomic accesses only?\n    submitted by    /u/poorlilwitchgirl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Notice how C and C++ aren't even from the same country, yet they can do all of the same things? Regardless of their origins, because C++ was built on C, you need to write libraries in C to support the functions of C++, if you don't have the standard libraries already. Even then, some older systems with separate I/Ospace don't let you too easily write interactive (or reactive) programs for them in C; luckily you can include assembly files for them to fit your hardware.\n One key difference in C functions from their C++ counterparts is how C++ replaces the target object of a function with a pointer named \"this\". That's its actual name; the indefinite demonstrative pronoun fits for being the object of which the function is a member in C++.\n Templates aren't exclusive to C++ either; in C you can imitate them with macros, that while they may destroy type safety, can still be used for dynamic dimensionality or objects whose size is dependent on a parameter. These are, of course, object-like macros. Sadly, most folks tend to forego both object-like and function-like macros and only define simple values or even just dummies whose only purpose is to satisfy preprocessor conditions and compile code within. In fact, using object-like and function-like macros in C, I do recommend the practice of adding types as arguments for as many different types are in your functions. You can actually do that as it's only ever the preprocessor that sees them.\n C can do encapsulation too, but requires objects to be in separate files included by a \"root\" file for it, whereas C++ has classes. Members in branch files are \"private\" if instantiated and \"protected\" if static. Members in the root file are \"public\". Trouble is that even C++ hasn't a type of class whose members are \"protected\" by default.\n    submitted by    /u/Moist_Internet_1046  \n [link]   [comments]",

According to the C standard, this results in undefined behavior. However, the exact implications of this are rather nebulous and dependent on several factors, including the underlying hardware and the compiler optimizations.\n so my question is How do different compilers (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC) handle such extreme pointer arithmetic? Are there specific flags or settings that can mitigate the undefined behavior in such cases?\n and How does the C standard address integer overflow in pointer arithmetic, and what are the recommended ways to detect and handle potential overflows?\n    submitted by    /u/putu420  \n [link]   [comments]",

I do this to implement \"hot reload\" for those set of functions. It did not work at first, because myshared.c referenced functions from mylib.c, and it obviously does not have the location of those symbols when it gets hotloaded (myshared.c was not a shared object at first. It was just a standardly linked object, linked in the main step).\n As an experiment, I modified the above to be the following:\n main: mylib.o libmyshared.so gcc -o main mylib.o main.c # Made the code position idependent mylib.o: mylib.c gcc -fPIC -c mylib.c # ADDED mylib.o as dependency libmyshared.so: mylib.o myshared.c gcc -fPIC -shared -o mylib.o libmyshared.so myshared.c \n I was surprised to see that the program \"worked\" properly (though it may only be working \"by accident\"). My thought was that both main and the libmyshared.so binary would have their own in-memory copy of mylib.o and the program wouldn't work properly. That said, all of the memory is owned by the main.c code, so mylib.c and libmyshared.so does not have any state of its own.\n My questions are: 1. In this configuration, are there two copies of mylib.o at runtime (e.g. one owned by main and the other owned by libmyshared.so)? I guess the symbols are just compiled into the binary, so there is just duplicate code. 2. Would making mylib.o into a shared object remedy that problem (i.e. make it only use one copy)?\n    submitted by    /u/haskell_account  \n [link]   [comments]",

They think that 343867 is the last (=biggest) number to require five terms, it should be at most four after that. The conjecture nor the suspicion have been proven, yet.\n I made a multi-threaded C program for Mac and Linux that analyses any given number from 1 to 232 -1. It is not specifically geared towards disproving (or confirming) the conjecture; it only looks at the single given number and calculates all its tetrahedral sums of up to five terms.\n For example: tetrasum -q 12345678 completes in about 2.3 s on an 11 year old Mac. On a Raspberry Pi 5 with 4 cores at 2.4 GHz, it took a little under 3 hours for my program to calculate that there are 863 tetrahedral sums of up to four terms for the number 232 -1, and another 377968 sums of five terms.\n Compilation command that worked for me is specified in the comments: gcc -std=gnu17 -Ofast -march=native -Wall -Wextra -o tetrasum tetrasum.c -lm -lpthread on Linux.\n Just having some fun.

          "description": "Numberphile asked a question on Twitter and their blog (now both deleted) if anyone could help determine which five tetrahedral numbers will sum to 343867. I solved it quickly with 5 nested loops which helped him I think, although I don't think he anticipated that there were no less than 277 different working combinations, ha!\n I also made a much shorter program in Python based on itertools.combinations but it was excruciatingly slow. So I wanted to make a similar function in C, and I did. Successive calls to the function return a pointer to an array of K distinct numbers, each time the next combination in lexicographical order of an \"N take K\" set. The last call, or a call with invalid arguments, frees the memory used by the function internally.\n I implemented Donald Knuth's algorithm from his book The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4A, §7.2.1.3, algorithm T, page 359. The only thing is that his lexicographical order goes from highest to lowest number, while we usually want to process the array in ascending order, so it's only really ordered if you reverse it. That is different from the Python version and the nested loops version. Ah well.\n Let me know what you think!

The general layout of the primary data structure is thus:\n struct global_data{ float *data; struct data *table; size_t size_data; size_t size_table; }; \n where data is a table of single precision values, table is a dynamic table structure, and size_data denotes the size of the data, and size_table denotes the number of struct data structs.\n The implementation of struct data is:\n struct data{ float *data[COL]; }; \n Each data struct will represent a specific matrix of data.\n The goal is to have a dynamic table of data to work with and pass around a specific part of some data processing program; the idea is to not have to call malloc k-times and have a fragmented heap.\n What goes on is the following:\n 1) Input the number of unique matrices\n 2) Allocate all relevant data : *table by way of number of matrices; *data for the total number of matrix elements\n 3) Link *data from struct data to specific segment of *data found in struct global_data.\n This is based on the current implementation. The next implementation is to have the *data field within struct data to be dynamic: based on some k-dimensional array or arbitrary size, as determined by the user input, rather than predefined by the const definition of COL.\n The idea is to alias specific regions of some single-allocated table to pointers within another data structure, who determines the size of its own data to work with.\n What would you recommend I do to best approach this? The main issue I seem to have is the next implementation may need to account fro k-deep for loops for k-dimensional data structures. That may not be realistic. Another way is to perform algebra on the aliased pointers to access specific regions, but I'm not sure if that is the best way of approaching this problem due to the issue of readability and the increased risk of segmentation faults.\n    submitted by    /u/learnin_too_code  \n [link]   [comments]",

I realize that this approach will have a significant impact on performance, but nevertheless I would like to give it a try in specific places in the project. The idea is to generate code around each memory load, check the pointer value and decide if the load should happen from other address.\n Pseudocode illustrating the idea:\n char * mapped_file; read(somefile, mapped_file, file_size); char load_hook(void * ptr) { if(ptr & 0xff000000) { return mapped_file[ptr & 0x00ffffff]; } else { return *ptr; } } char s[] = \"some data\"; char * p = 0xff000002; char load_1 = *s; char load_2 = *p; // load_1 will contain first byte in s[], // load_2 will contain th…",

See for example GCC bug 107107. \n so I assume that, even though the project disables strict aliasing checks explicitly, the above pattern should remain valid even if they were enabled.\n Is my assumption correct? If not, how would one go about interpreting a region of memory as different types (e.g., when implementing file format parsers, or manipulating in-memory data structures provided by an operating system kernel)?\n EDIT: The second example is harmless, as it creates a pointer from an integer.

          "description": "I have a simple singly linked list, where each node has a next pointer to the next node, and a data pointer to whatever the consumer wants to point to. I want the same linked list implementation to be able to hold both function pointers and data pointers.\n Since void pointers are not allowed to be converted to function pointers in the C standard (I think since processors with Harvard architectures can store instructions and data differently?), my current solution is to create two wrapper structs, one for instruction and data pointers respectively, and then have the linked list node point to the wrapper. \n Is this the simplest way to go about things? Here are some things I thought about:\n  \nSection 2.12.3 of the POSIX standard (PDF) says that function pointers should be safely convertible to void pointers and back, but I want to make my program portable to non-POSIX systems if I can help it.\n I thought about simply having a void pointer which could either point to a data pointer or a function pointer, instead of having the struct wrapper. But I don't think this works because we would need to allocate space for the function pointer to live, and malloc only returns void pointers, so we get back to the same problem.\n I could simply having two implementations of a linked list, one that holds function pointers and another that holds data pointers, but I want to share as much code as possible.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/SereneCalathea  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I created a simple REPL in C that reads a line of input and prints it back, while saving the history of inputs entered by the user. Before you judge me as a noob (I don't mind that tbh), listen.\n Why create a stupid REPL?\n Well, creating a basic REPL that reads input until the user hits ENTER is straightforward. However, allowing the user to navigate through input history with the UP and DOWN arrow keys is more challenging because:\n  \nImmediate Input Handling: You don't get what the user typed until they hit ENTER. This is problematic because users expect the previous command to be displayed immediately upon pressing the UP arrow key.\n Raw Mode and Escape Sequences: To handle user input on each key press, the terminal input must be in raw mode. And once you're in raw mode, say bye bye to the default behavior of the terminal like CTRL+C to exit, CTRL+D to send EOF, or something as simple as backspace handling. You have to handle all of these manually. In fact, you have to responsible for writing back the character that the user types to the terminal.\n  \nYou can read more about raw mode and escape sequences in my notes:\n  \nRaw mode: https://github.com/biraj21/echo-repl/blob/main/notes/raw-mode.md\n Escape sequences: https://github.com/biraj21/echo-repl/blob/main/notes/escape-sequences.md\n  \nBtw this stupid REPL is roughly 500 lines of (probably buggy) code!\n Source code: https://github.com/biraj21/echo-repl\n Please go through the README once to understand the behaviour of history in this implementation.\n Motivation? Needed it to follow https://buildyourownlisp.com/ book, and I was unable to build the library suggested there on my Mac.\n Would appreciate your feedback.

Just some idea had when I was studying decison trees and I wanna see if it works. \n Is it even feasible? What approaches would you try? How can I do matrix multiplications and additions?

          "description": "I'm working in embedded C. The device receives ascii text one character at a time over a serial port and I would like to recognize when certain regex patterns appear in the stream. The character rate is highly variable and there are other tasks to perform, so I can't simply block on the serial port and collect data as a string.\n What I want is something like PEARL with various rules and actions, but with a one-char-at-a-time input. And it has to play nice with other round-robin tasks.\n The goal would be to do something like stringRecognizer() in the code below. The pattern rules would be regex that are pre-compiled by the lex-generator for (e.g.) recognizing the strings \"CAT\", \"DOG\" and \"PIG\" and returning an appropriate enum value that would trigger an action.\n The function is stateful, so it knows if it has seen (e.g.) C and then A, so a subsequent T would return ACTION_CAT but an R (or anything else) would return ACTION_NOT_DONE and move on. A D would also return ACTION_NOT_DONE but move the state into the DOG rule (so CADOG would eventually trigger the DOG rule). There might be a rule to reset the state machine when a new-line or carriage-return is seen.\n I've looked at lex, flex and re2c but none provides a stateful pattern recognizer. In all cases the state machine pulls data from either a string or an input stream, but is otherwise fully blocking. When the lex() function returns (to main()) all state is lost and restarts when a new string is supplied.\n while(1) { doTask1(); // blink led doTask2(); // read a sensor if (serialInputHasData()) { char c = getch(); action_t action = stringRecognizer(c); switch(action) { case ACTION_CAT: doCatFunction(); break; case ACTION_DOG: doDogFunction(); break; case ACTION_PIG: doPigFunction(); break; case ACTION_NOT_DONE: break; default: break; } } } \n    submitted by    /u/somewhereAtC  \n [link]   [comments]",

(Impossible)\n Sorry for bad hand writing. The idea is simple something like this:\n We give each other our public keys. You and me accomplish for two numbers (pre-partial-numbers that produce the pre-chain) and then we give each other their encrypted versions and then we have the final-chain (the protocol and client software can have common sorting and hashing as a reducer function... for example into a game card) After all each client software verifies the final chain with public keys of each peer and each peer will ensure that their pre-partial numbers are there inside and it is making the chaos for randomness because the common hasher/reducer function's hash is gonna be unpredictable.\n The fact that's providing this is that when peers encrypt their pre-partial-numbers with their private keys (RSA) there is no any pattern between them to predict and break the protocol safety. (Or there is? Idk.)\n If this whole thing is not bullshit, I will implement it in my game server.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/EvrenselKisilik  \n [link]   [comments]",

The election processes do indeed finish, upon which point the coordinator process (rank n-1) sends out the ST leader to all GS processes and the GS leader to all ST processes respectively.\n Everything works fine for the ST election and message passing, but for some reason, when the coordinator sends out the GS_ELECT event to all ST processes after the GS leader election, the ST processes do not receive the event. I tried logging the probe's tag, and it is just always START_LELECT_ST and no matter what event is sent afterward, it just never changes the status of the probe, neither with GS_LEADER nor with TERMINATE.\n The relevant ST receiving part is on line 200 of the pastebin source code. I am busting my head trying to figure out why this is happening since if I am not mistaken, MPI_Probe and MPI_Iprobe should be seeing the pending new events and grabbing their tags.\n Any help is greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Najishukai  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all. So, as a challenge to myself to actually start doing projects in C, I decided to make a ncurses-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Part of the logic involves storing the current state in one matrix, and using that to build a second matrix for the next generation's state. Each cycle, the 'next state' (we'll call it m2) becomes the 'previous state' (m1), and my first implementation simply involved looping through the matrices and overwriting each cell of m1 with the corresponding cell of m2. While this works fine, I wanted to do it more \"optimally\" by simply swapping two pointer addresses. This is the function that I came up with:\n void swap_ptr(int (**p1)[ROWS][COLS], int (**p2)[ROWS][COLS]) { int (*tmp)[ROWS][COLS] = *p1; *p1 = *p2; *p2 = tmp; return; } \n The implementation looks like this:\n int matrix1[ROWS][COLS]; int matrix2[ROWS][COLS]; int (*m1)[ROWS][COLS] = &matrix1; int (*m2)[ROWS][COLS] = &matrix2; /* main loop starts, insert Life logic here to populate m2 based on the contents of m1*/ display(*m2); swap_ptr(&m1, &m2); \n This appears to be working fine, but it's not at all like the methods I found online for the same thing, which instead called for something more like:\n void swap_ptr(int ***p1, int ***p2); \n Is there something wrong with the way I'm doing it, or is this just one of those funny C things where there's multiple \"correct\" ways to do something? Thanks in advance!\n EDIT: fixed typos in my code examples.\n    submitted by    /u/XineOP  \n [link]   [comments]",

My background includes an undergrad degree in Computer Science and several software engineering internships. I have a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming using Java, as well as web and mobile development with technologies like React and Node.js.\n While I consider myself proficient in developing products, I’m aware that the rise of workflow automation might impact the relevance of some skills I currently possess. To stay ahead, I’m planning to deepen my expertise in C programming and explore branches such as embedded programming and advanced uses of C/C++.\n I have a decent handle on solving LeetCode problems and a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms. However, I aim to achieve a deeper understanding of programming and want to have skills that can make me a better developer and a valuable employee.\n I’m here to ask for advice and pointers from those with more experience. Should I focus on C/C++ for embedded systems, or are there other areas within systems programming I should consider? I am also taking a Computer Systems course on the side. I appreciate all the feedbacks I can get - roadmaps, youtube series, project ideas, literally anything. Thank you. \n PS - I am also trying to explore if I really like programming in C in long-term so I want to go in-depth.

In the last chapter about the Unix system, there is a part about building the fopen function with system calls. In this, we use some kind of internal flags, for example, _READ instead of O_RDONLY. In the implementation, it uses both the POSIX and the internal flags. As I understand it, it uses both because in order to detect if some FILE has write privileges, for example, you can intersect bits, and if the intersection is different than 0, it has the privilege. However, this breaks when using O_RDONLY because it has the value 0, so it is not possible to detect if a combination of flags has the O_RDONLY flag with this aproach.\n So my question is, why does POSIX start with 0 instead of 1 and shift the rest by 2*n?\n (Maybe the answer is obvious, but I don't see it.)\n    submitted by    /u/vaquitson  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I have some prior programming experience with C and Python but never managed to go pass the basics. Hopefully I will get to a point where I can do something useful with these languages around this time)\n Nonetheless, I am following the classic \"The C Programming Language\" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. In the introductory chapter (A TUTORIAL INTRODUCTION - Page 6), the first example to print Hello World goes something like this:\n # include <stdio.h> main () { printf(\"Hello, world\\n\"); } \n When I compiled it with the cc or gcc compiler, an error was produced:\n error: return type defaults to 'int' \n Naturally, I went back to the thought process that I had in my previous attempts at learning C. I simply declared the return type for the main() function to be void and it compiled successfully. The changed code goes like this:\n # include <stdio.h> void main () { printf(\"Hello, world\\n\"); } \n What am I missing out from the example?

I’ve programmed in Python on the past, but I will need to refresh, as I have used C more lately.\n But should I build the assembler, and maybe the next required software (I think it is a VM and a compiler), with C?

          "description": "Hello everyone, I'm working with an STM32G070CB microcontroller and facing an issue where the USART2 interrupt isn't being triggered after populating the TDR with the first byte. Despite configuring the USART with FIFO enabled and setting up the correct NVIC priorities, the data isn't being transmitted, and the ISR isn't called. I've checked the usual suspects like global interrupts, USART initialization, and error flags, but the problem persists. Here's a brief overview of my setup: FIFO is enabled for USART2. NVIC is configured with the correct priority for USART2 interrupts. Global interrupts are enabled. USART2 is initialized with the correct settings (baud rate, word length, etc.). Hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) is enabled.\n    submitted by    /u/PuzzleheadedScreen61  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have not been working on it for quite some time.\n My questions are: Do you see yourself using such a library if it is \"stable\" and working? Do you think it is worth spending time improving it?\n The library became my playground to discover a lot of stuff and there a lot of features. UTF-8 support, wide char, UTF-16 and UTF-32 support with libunistring, _Decimal printing, stdfix.h printing, struct tm formatting, full python format specifier support, monetary printing support, configurable multiple ways of printing floating point numbers - using strfromd or RYU library or my own implementation of floating point printing, …",

The goal of this project was to create a boolean expression solver. Any comments, suggestions, critiques are welcome. I did everything except for the abstract syntax tree class (ast.cpp and ast.h) therefore I am not interested in any critiques involving the code in those files, but everything else is fair game (including the readme and the cmakelists.txt). This was my first time using cmake.\n I do have one question, though. We received a 98/100 on the project, with two points being deducted. The TA stated that using a makefile instead of cmake would be better, and that it would \"greatly simplify and improve the build process\".

Been working with PHP for a pretty long period of time. Let’s start with the task I am working on and what problem I have got and want to tackle in the best way possible.\n Recently, I have reminded myself a project I have been working in university - Trains Schedule. Main functions had to be: - Show trains schedule - Search among various filters - CRUD\n So I have decided to rework on that using Raylib with a GUI instead of console. Wanted to fancy fonts, SFX and stuff.\n Problem came from place where I didn’t though of - Config class. Because config file contains fonts settings, sfx settings, misc, etc.\n How do I properly do a Config class to be able to be used among various classes without a need of re-reading a config file?\n Would really appreciate some constructive feedback on this matter.\n Regards.\n    submitted by    /u/Romanovich0195    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I hate to ask this question, but I need help. I need to learn C++ for a project that requires me to implement a function into existing code. I know I'll need to use classes for this. While the function itself isn't too difficult, understanding where it belongs, what inputs it needs, what it should output, and how it all fits together is the challenging part.\n I'm not an expert in programming; I'm more of a beginner. I know basic concepts like loops and data types, and I understand the idea of pointers, classes etc.. My main problem is applying these concepts correctly in different situations and internalizing them.\n I've been using learncpp.com, which I like, but it seems too time-intensive. Maybe I'm approaching it the wrong way? I read, make notes, and then try the examples. This takes a lot of time. I am on part three \"Debugging\" part. \n I then switched to studyplan.dev, which offers shorter lessons. However, it sometimes feels too superficial and lacks practical exercises. Here, I also completed Chapter 3 about classes. \n I recently discovered Codecademy's free C++ course. Would you recommend it, or do you have other suggestions? Or should I stick with learncpp and force myself to learn it this way?\n I also saw that there are some YouTube videos, and I like the concept of watching people explain things. However, I'm not sure if there are very good series on C++.\n I would appreciate any advice you can offer.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/chiefbroson    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I'm am looking for information on the way you handle your project's build targets, the best practices, what worked the best for you and your teams.\n Specifically, other than debug and release targets, do you maintain other build configuration when releasing software ? Personally, I rarely only maintain those 2 targets: I have at least a RETAIL/FINAL build, and sometimes, a test build. More than 4 targets is a pain to deal with, so I never go there. Here's the differences between them, the features they have:\n Debug build: should be for development only, not for testing. Debug version will include debug info, and no optimization;\n Release build, more specifically 'development release': does contain liited debug information (generated program database files, pdbs) but also has some degree of optimizations. The rationale of this build is that the debug build often is too big, bulky and slow to be practical when testing or reproducing a bug.\n Final/Retail : here the build has zero debug information, full optimization and for example, in visual studio, WholeProgramOptimization and link-time code generation to perform whole-program optimization. Leveraging optimizing compilers : OCs take the code that you have written and re-write parts of it in order to minimize the memory footprint, maximize execution speed, or both. Making it very hard to debug.\n Sometime, a QA build is maintained because our QA have specific needs in regards with what they need to test the software.\n What are you guys thoughts oon this ? If you also maintain a 'production' build in addition to the release buid, how to did you name it ? retail ? final ?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/zolaternative    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

In other words, padding is not allowed before the first data member of a standard-layout type. Note that strict aliasing rules still apply to the result of such cast.\n  \nIs this relevant to the above? I.e. does dereferencing int_through_a violate strict aliasing because a given standard layout type is not generally similar to its first member? https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion#Similar_types ; https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reinterpret_cast#Type_accessibility ; or is it fine because we know there is an object of type int at this address even though the pointer is obtained from a reinterpret_cast? \n Secondly, is it correct that skipping the line (i.e. initializing int_through_b) is UB?\n    submitted by    /u/KuntaStillSingle    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can find SCPs in crew scheduling or test selection, for example.\n Currently, commercial MILP solvers like Cplex or Gurobi are often the go-to option for SCPs. But, while they are powerful, well-designed heuristics can often achieve even better results (especially when the available time is tight).\n Our implementation is based on the work of Caprara, Fischetti, and Toth. It was originally developed for a research project, but we've decided to clean it up and make it publicly available as a free, high-performing alternative.\n We also hope the library serves as a helpful companion to the original paper, which can get a bit technical at times.\n Since this is our first real open-source contribution, any constructive feedback is welcomed. We hope this library will prove helpful.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/__c4v4    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or should I start with something easier like Python?\n My thinking goes like this: If I where to learn Python, I would have to sit with it every day after work hours and learn, but If I learn C++ - I can learn a little bit in my spare time, but still interact with it every day and learn some things from my job.\n My goal is not to become a developer, but to work within cyber security. And to be proficient in that field, I need to learn at least 1 programming language from my understanding.\n Thanks for reading, and have a good day!\n    submitted by    /u/xs0crates    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I get the whole paradigm about having a completely valid, initialized object as soon as it comes into being via the \"resource acquisition\".\n However, it seems to me that this is the much less important part of RAII. The more imporant part being: objects out of scope release their resources automatically. \n The destructor releasing the resources (e.g. a lock_guard releasing a mutex) is much harder to get right because releasing it manually would have to occur at the end of the scope. Conversely, if we weren't allowed to use a constructor, it wouldnt be as hard to manage, because the initialization would usually follow closely after the resource allocation. \n Consider the following example: \n int fun() { SomeBigObject* o = new SomeBigObject(); // assume empty constructor // 1. Initialize o->name = \"someName\"; o->number = 42; // ... // 2. Stuff happens, maybe early return, maybe exception delete o; // 3. Missing this is much more consequential! } \n Now lets assume SomeBigObject does have a more useful constructor, with the initalizations I made to be done there, but no destructor. Taken literally, you would have \"acquired the resources\" and \"initialized them\" with only a constructor - even though this is not what is generally understood by RAII, which usually entails the destructor that does the cleanup when something goes out of scope.\n ​\n  \nAm I missing something or is there another good reason that I'm missing?\n Why couldnt the committee think of a better name? It confused me a lot in the beginning. I think something like \"Ownership & Valid intialization as a class invariant\" or something.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Gay-B0wser    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are still on C++17 at my firm and while I have learned some things during my time at this company, my company is in an industry where low latency programming is really important, and when I interviewed for other companies in the industry, they made it abundantly clear that expertise of C++20 and above is crucial for the industry.\n I would like to get more modern C++ programming experience while I stay in this role so that I have some job mobility in case my future in this company goes awry. For those of you in jobs where the tech is behind, how do you manage to keep up? I’ve started reading some books on modern C++ programming and I’ve been trying to find open source projects to work on, but I haven’t really found many projects online that make use of a lot of the modern C++20 syntax (e.g. concepts, ranges, even older stuff like CRTP). Would appreciate any input!\n Edit: think there are people dming me with the assumption that I’m just a beginner who just started cpp programming. Listen, I don’t claim to know everything but I’m not a dumbass either (so don’t patronize me), I am really just looking to get more experience working with implementing real systems with more modern (++20 and above) C++.

If you don't know how thermocouples work, essentially it's a simple device of 2 wires being welded together, and at specific temperatures they output a known voltage. \n This is commonly used for temperature measurement, as you can measure the voltage to get temperature (simplified). In order to know the temperature based off of the voltage you must have the table that corresponds the voltage and temperature. Since this table is just temperature to voltage, its 2 columns. However the tables sometimes have 1500+ rows.To add to the pain, I haven't been able to find a text file of these tables, only PDF formats. \n What would be the fastest way to implement these tables into memory and search through one column of data to find the corresponding data point.

I am on chapter 2 which is where it goes over functions and their different types.\n Once thing i've notices is that it keeps going over the same code it went over before and modifying it to find out different ways you can go about writing the code.\n For example: Void and Int functions.\n I'm quite familiar with int functions but quite confused on void because it doesn't explain what it is very well. In section 2.4 it goes off imediatley showing a code I practised alot and understand how it works but then soon shows how we can make it work with the void function.\n The code (Int):\n include <iostream>\n int getValueFromUser() { std::cout << \"Enter an integer\"; int input; std::cin >> input; return input; }\n int main() { int num{ getValueFromUser() }; std::cout << num << \" Doubled is: \" << num * 2 << '\\n'; return 0;\n  \nPretty straightforward right? You're making the code prompt you to enter an integer and then it will double the the number.\n Example:\n 4 Doubled is: 8\n But then the tutorial brought that one back again and decided to make it work with the void function.\n include <iostream>\n int getValueFromUser() { std::cout << \"Enter an integer\"; int input; std::cin >> input; return input; }\n void printDouble(int value) { std::cout << value << \" Doubled is: \" << value * 2 << '\\n' }\n int main() { int num { getValueFromUser() }; printDouble(num); return 0; }\n  \nMy biggest annoyance here is why are you trying to make me do 50 extra steps to a code I already got good at, no wonder i'm confused on how your explaining things.\n Any better tutorial so I don't have to deal with this?\n    submitted by    /u/Ko938AUp    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here's what I've come up with so far...\n  \nEach header file uses the full file path as the header guard (e.g. a/b/c.h uses __A_B_C_H__ for its header guard).\n Each source/header file is wrapped in a namespace that mirrors the file path (e.g. everything in a/b/c.h is in namespace a::b::c).\n  \nIs this too much? Do other projects do similar things? My thinking with the two points above was that it'll almost eliminate any name conflicts and it'll organize things the way I see them in the file system. The only problem is that it'll be tedious if I ever have to move files around.\n    submitted by    /u/korkvid    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have some c++ and programming experience but it is limited to scripting and programming Arduino. In college I took intro to c++ and a computational fluid dynamics course in which I wrote c++ scripts to solve and model differential equations. I am a mechanical engineer so I have also used matlab extensively for work, programmed robots in a language similar to python, lua for writing touchOSC scripts, and VBA for automating excel. It’s quite a hodgepodge of programming skill sets and again all individual scripts of varying complexity.\n I am now working on a project developing software for a multitrack looper for making music. I am currently using an open source software looping program but would like to write my own. \n This would be a “real” program, something with a rudimentary UI and multiple functions that can be compiled and run as an executable. I am having trouble figuring out how to make the jump from simple scripts to actual software development. Can you point me in the direction of some learning resources to move from this sort of “beginner” level programming to something more intermediate level? \n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Breakfast-990    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am trying to follow the one from the Head First Design Pattern books where it only has the function hasNext() and Next(). On paper it seems straightforward but I am trying to pinpoint if my problem is with the understanding of what exactly is a map iterator and what exactly I am passing. With regards to my uni textbook, it does not cover maps.\n To my understanding, a map is composed of a pair struct where first is the key and the other is the value. In order to go through the whole map I need the iterator for the first element and the last element and I can get those via map.begin() and map.end() and an iterator can be progressed via the ++ operator. I am trying to protect my map by encapsulating it in a class thus an iterator class is the only way for me to go through the map. Now I am confused as to what exactly I should be passing when I am iterating and how I can control access of the iterator so as not to expose my map.\n    submitted by    /u/towerbooks3192    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I thought this violated strict-aliasing rules so was undefined behaviour, but with how much I'm seeing it in our code it has me doubting myself. As this is written by people with a lot more experience then me.\n If you have a char* or uint8_t* you've read off a socket or character device:\n char buffer[512]; // or std::uint8_t buffer[512] // imagine we're reading from a device or socket into the buffer here... // then later: const std::uint32_t *ptr = reinterpret_cast<const std::uint32_t*>(buffer); const uint32_t n = ntohl(*ptr); // etc... \n I don't see -fno-strict-aliasing in our compiler flags either. But I thought that while you can cast a pointer to any type to a char/uint8_t pointer, it doesn't work the other way round. The compiler is free to optimise based on that assumption, not to mention issues with alignment, caching etc. \n If I'm wrong can someone explain where how? I may have misunderstood aliasing rules.

So one extract causes two sides decrements.\n  \nFortunately, the last version of C++ Builder seems to be moving away from Dinkumware, but until I upgrade, is anyone here aware of a broader list of Dinkumware bugs?

          "description": "Hi! As far as I can tell, the Intel C++ compiler, icpx, does not support anything in the <bit> header. Specifically, I'd like to use std::endian in my project. Here is an example that fails with icpx -std=c++23. It works with gcc-13.2.0 and clang-17. It is a bit confusing becasue the compiler uses the GCC library which does support this feature. Feature description and search for std::endian.\n ```\n include <iostream>\n include <bit>\n int main() { std::cout << \"Hello, World!\" << std::endl; if (std::endian::native == std::endian::big_endian) std::cout << \"Native is big endian\" << std::endl; else if (std::endian::native == std::endian::little_endian) std::cout << \"Native is little endian\" << std::endl; } ```\n I'm being pressured by management to use the Intel compiler for \"customer support\" reasons. But this is a four year old feature that doesn't compile... Is supporting the Intel compiler a bad idea?\n EDIT: Thanks to /u/pdimov2 it seems like this was some sort of an issue with my local compiler as it does work in Godbolt.\n    submitted by    /u/geekboy730    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

The key point is that I definitely don't need a gigantic swiss army knife GUI framework, I only need the basic stuff - simple layout, a couple of basic widgets, rudimentary window support. Think basic Win32 - toolbars with buttons, menus, some configuration windows with lists and checkboxes, that sort of stuff. Having \"native\" looking UI (whatever that means these days) is of no concern.\n The important visual bit of the program is going to be a vector based data visualizer and it needs to be very snappy, have very clean looking rendering and very smooth zooming. That's the most challenging bit, I think. As for basic GUI, I've actually made a basic sketch of a GUI builder of sorts a while ago in Lua (just by relying on the existing pixel drawing function and font rendering) and I didn't find it overly difficult.\n The main issues are that I'm unfamiliar with Cpp (I do have some experience with C, I still remember it fairly well), and I'm going to be developing on Windows while having no idea how much work it'll take to build and distribute it on OSX until I've actually progressed a good deal.\n As far as general GUI multiplatform development goes... I dunno, I've spent a great deal of time researching the subject and it seems that no silver bullet exists, not even remotely. Every option has serious cons and issues. Qt, Java, countless web-based frameworks, and then of course every language has its cons too. For instance, I've been tinkering with Dear PyGui lately (Python bindings for ImGui) and Python doesn't seem to have a good distribution system to end users.\n    submitted by    /u/abir_valg2718    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am also comparing the performance of my implementation against the performance of the ktprime \"emhash8\" hashmap. Currently, when I test both hashmaps with google's benchmarks library, it shows that my hashmap design is extremely slow, nearly 3 times slower than emhash8 and significantly slower than std::unordered_map , however, when I test all 3 hashmaps CLion's integrated profiler, it shows that my hashmap is faster than the other 2 hashmaps. I initially assumed this was because I ran my hashmap first when I tested with CLions profiler, but the changing the order of the benchmarks doesn't appear to effect the performance. I am not sure which performance metric I should follow here.\n    submitted by    /u/Jark5455    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

This means I cannot transform the C code right away into modern C++ with unit tests and all the code quality tools I would like.\n As long as I'm grooming it up, I tend to make mistakes. Namely I refactor the code before I functionally replace the old code with a modern C++ approach. For instance, I replace statements like\n anOldCStruct->memberfield->memberfield2->value = x; anOldCStruct->memberfield->memberfield2->value2 = y; anOldCStruct->memberfield->memberfield2->value3 = z; \n into \n auto* memberfield2 = anOldCStruct->memberfield->memberfield2; memberfield2->value = x; memberfield2->value2 = y; memberfield2->value3 = z; \n but I run into problems with boolean variables, as I mistakenly remove negative logic ! without noticing. We have pull requests and these mistakes are also not detected, so double human problem here.\n That's why I'm asking this: before I can go full unit testing, does anybody know if there's any tool that can detect from git commit to git commit the change of boolean logic that it's \"easy\" to miss if you're a human but not if you're a computer?\n    submitted by    /u/somecucumber    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

With the approach I'm trying If the currently selected object is changed, it seems like any edits made are not kept in memory.\n As an example, the below code (in my mind) should allow the user to swap between two \"Fruit\" objects which exist on the heap, prompting the user to change the color of the currently selected fruit and automatically swap to the other.\n When I call setColor(\"green\") on apple, after swapping the currentFruit from banana back to apple again if I call getColor() on apple it returns \"red\", which doesn't make sense to me,\n How can you keep a “Fruit” object in memory that remembers its variables have been changed? Or does this question not make sense in this language and is this approach fundamentally wrong?\n #include <iostream> #include <string> using namespace std; class Fruit { string name; string color; public: Fruit (string n, string c) { setName(n); setColor(c); }; void setName(string s) {name = s; return;}; string getName() {return name;}; void setColor(string s) {color = s; return;}; string getColor() {return color;}; }; Fruit* a = new Fruit(\"apple\", \"red\"); Fruit* b = new Fruit(\"banana\", \"yellow\"); int main() { Fruit currentFruit = (*a); bool keepGoing = true; while (keepGoing) { cout << \"\\nthe current fruit is \" << currentFruit.getName() << endl; cout << \"\\nit is \" << currentFruit.getColor() << endl; string newColor; cin >> newColor; currentFruit.setColor(newColor); cout << \"\\nokay, now \"<< currentFruit.getName() << \" is \"; cout << currentFruit.getColor() << endl; if (currentFruit.getName() == \"apple\") { currentFruit = (*b); } else { currentFruit = (*a); } } return 0; } \n    submitted by    /u/MetalKev    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As you know, one of the main gripes with C++ development is related to compilation time. Compiler vendors constantly strive to make improvements in this area, in spite of new STL features being constantly added. C++26 is going to be quite special in this regard though afaik, having the reflections proposal accepted. Reflections being probably the biggest metaprogramming extensions ever added to the language, even bigger than concepts and require clauses.\n I'm saying this because I was watching this particular talk by Alexander Fokin describing it: https://youtu.be/FqzrQf6Xr8g?si=oe6L0askoOzQjSlC&t=3592 . What immediately caught my attention was the example of how you could implement std::tuple (almost fully) in what? 20 lines of code? For reference, MSVC's implementation is a header with more than 1000 lines of code ( https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/main/stl/inc/tuple ), containing dozens of helper class template instantiated for each instance of std::tuple used in real code. A fair assumption would be that the std::meta version would be far faster to compile, reflections being a very straight-forward way of expressing your intent to the compiler. In real life scenarios this could results in an immense amount of time saved at compilation time. And better yet, the opportunity of rewritting std::tuple would be a big bonus too since none of the standard implementations are optimal ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ilujab/it_turns_out_stdtuple_is_not_a_zerocost/ ).\n Again, I'm not talking just about std::tuple here, I'm assuming there are dozens of STL components that could use being rewritten using reflections, if for nothing else, at least for the sake of compilation time. I'm wondering if this new feature couldn't be the push vendors have needed to take into consideration a real ABI break with one of their future releases, considering the compilation time improvements now available on the table. \n    submitted by    /u/cristi1990an    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I started working with unreal and started messing around and found it rather simple.\n I then asked a programmer friend of mine for some tasks I could do to improve my knowledge, and suggested I try create a single Linked List, after multiple days, nothing, I could not figure it out to save my life. What bothers me is after looking up solutions online it looked like something extremely simple, and i realized just how much unreal does in the backend, now I just feel disheartened with a simple Linked List brought me to my knees. Anyways, not thinking of giving up, just more for those struggling to keep pushing and maybe some words of encouragement if this is the right place to ask/turn to.

Please tell me it is restricted.\n  \nI'm currently working for porting existing libraries like magic_enum, fastgltf and etc (which are used in my private module based projects). Changing dependencies with module is quite easy and giving me much benefits for compile time.\n During porting, I'm curious about which folder is the proper location for module port file (which ends with .cppm or .ixx extensions). At first I think src or module is the answer, because it is not header file and cannot be included. However, I realized that package managers like vcpkg does not install files in those folders, but compile the sources files to static/shared libraries (which ends with .a or .so extensions).\n Some module supporting libraries like Vulkan-Hpp and glm locates the module file in include directory. In this case, vcpkg install the header files to include directory and user can fetch them using ${glm_SOURCE_DIR}/include/glm/glm.cppm to declare module target.\n There are many package managing strategies that are preserving file structures, but I think CMake + vcpkg is the de facto system for C++ developers, so I'm confusing about the proper module exposing method.

So, it can become difficult to understand which privates get used externally, without inspecting the friends. To try to keep things sane, I segregate those members to their own private section. Best I can do is put comments to say they are used externally.\n private: // These are used by friends Foo mBar; Some Function(); private: //... Other private sections are not used by friends. \n I wish C++ supported a 'friend:' access specifier in classes, similar to public/protected/private.\n friend: Foo mBar; Some Function(); private: // ... \n If a class has a 'friend:' section, then those members are consider private, and they can be accessed by friend classes/functions.

Currently we are using .net's foreign function interface (PInvoke) to call the library, however it is a bit fragile and we have to meet a few odd requirements like using a thread with a non-standard max stack size.\n I am thinking maybe I should wrap the api calls in a separate program (probably written in c++) to execute c++ calls that I will run in a separate process and use ipc to communicate. This will probably be a bit more robust as I can recover from process crashes and do not need to implement a producer/consumer queue with a separate thread etc. to schedule api calls.

          "description": "Hi everyone, I wrote a blog post about a small C++ library I recently wrote called raptor. I thought I'd share it here for anyone interested: https://dma-neves.github.io/dma/raptor.html\n Raptor offers similar performance and capabilities to thrust, but offers a more abstract interface. Raptor provides a set of smart containers (vector, array, vector, scalar) and skeletons (map, reduce, scan, filter, sort) that can be applied over the smart containers. Containers can store the data both on the host (CPU) and device (GPU), and expose a seemingly unified memory address space. Skeletons are executed on the device. Containers are automatically and lazily allocated and synchronized whenever a skeleton is executed.\n    submitted by    /u/dma_snow    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I'm pretty new to cpp and am trying to work out the best design for a problem I'm having. I'm wondering if shared pointers are the way to go. \n The problem: I have a class that makes an expensive database query during construction. The information retrieved is static though and most of the class functions don't even depend on the data. Furthermore, a class instance might be constructed multiple times during a single call from the upstream application , and each time this expensive and often unnecessary db call is made.\n My idea: Lazy load the db query only when it's first needed and then store the data in a global cache that will exist for the entirety of the application call. I can't control if 10 instances of this class are created, but I can limit to a single db call instead of 10. \n Is a shared pointer amongst the class instances a feasible and a solution here? My understanding is that the a shared pointer to the cache will keep it alive as I need, but I'm unsure how to pass a pointer between the instances like this. I'm also wondering if I'm overthinking the problem and there is a simpler solution I'm not considering. I'd appreciate any advice or insight, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/epicmouse77    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Because of this, we recommend that you cache any algorithm provider handles that you will use more than once, rather than opening and closing the algorithm providers over and over.\n  \nThis implies to me that you can globally initialize the algorithm handle and reuse it throughout your application in all threads.

I'm aware of their existence and \"what they do, kinda, sorta...\", but I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle.\n I don't feel like I can use these features because I d…",

Just like how there's no array type but there is the int array of size one type or the string array of size two type and so on. For so long I've been thinking that a struct is a type and then there's just different versions of it... and yeah these might be their own types but it was never a conscious thought in my mind... they both just blurred together.\n Here, https://imgur.com/a/UTUpZcN we can see that I've got the part highlighted. I'm declaring it in the long var way just to be clear about how the type is on the left of equals and the literal is on the right. The type sentient is simply a named type for that struct. But of course this makes a whole new type. Just like how I can have two floats be different types (one Celsius and another Fahrenheit) to keep them conceptually different. They couldn't be combined. But really this is a convenience... structs in the end are all unique types based on the properties given... right?\n    submitted by    /u/HighOptical  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't remember seeing it in the books I read so far (I read the 100 common mistakes and the Effective Go books).\n I inherited some application and had many problems with properly shutting things down. There was always something that 'stuck' or lived after it shouldn't have... After going a few circles I introduced a rule that is summarized as\n  \nfunctions should be synchronous\n if they need to start multiple goroutines to do stuff in parallel, they are free to do that\n but they need to wait until those routines terminate.\n  \nI also introduced contexts where the previous guy was a bit lazy, and this thing emerged as a pattern. I can be sure that things are properly shut down when the function returns to the caller. There are no more 'ghost effects' from go routines of the 'past'.\n Since I started doing this my thinking about handling gorutines completely changed, and I often spot the lack of it in others' code, then immediately see that they don't have the same guarantees about ghosts and termination that I have.\n Sometimes this is a bit hard to do, for example when dealing with Reader.Read() in a goroutine. Because Read() doesn't have context and can block for unbounded time. But I always have this ichy feeling that this is somehow bad and figure out a way to make the function behave well (to my standards). I tend to follow it especially within our codebase.\n We do mostly backend stuff, my experience with go is limited to that subject.\n I call this 'leave no goroutine behind', but it might have a name already.

My database still has a schema; the schema is just shifted from SQL table definitions over into the code itself. If I change the format of a struct representing the document in a collection or add a relational field to another collection, previous records in the DB need to be updated to reflect this, or I end up with bad data.\n Right now I'm handling this with a function for each migration step. Each migration has an ID associated to it and I keep a migrations collection with the timestamp when this migration was run (if it was run). This way I don't have to rerun any previous steps. I'm trying to make each one idempotent, so even without the migration collection, they could potentially run again if needed. The \"migrations\" collection is just for performance purposes, to avoid having to run all historic migrations every time the app starts.\n I've been reading about the various SQL DB migration tools, and declarative state based migrations vs functional time-series migrations. The latter sounds roughly like what I'm doing. I'm mostly just trying to understand if what I'm doing is common or if there's some better way that I hadn't considered (and why?)\n How are you dealing with this?\n    submitted by    /u/RomanaOswin  \n [link]   [comments]",

I cannot initiate the client at start time and reuse it (setting the token before calling the api) because I could have race conditions where an user ends up with the token from someone else, so sharing an authenticated client seems like a no go. \n I think I could create a client per http request, making it unique per client, but then if I only make one call to gitlab per request it's the same thing as never reusing the client.\n Do I make sense?

          "description": "Hello all. I've been working as an embedded software engineer for about 8 years and wanted to move my career in the direction of backend and cloud. I was just rejected from a role after completing a take home assignment writing a simple RESTful API for a microservice managing one resource. The position was a Golang position (which I admittedly have no experience in) but the assignment did not have to be written in Go. I decided to write it in Go anyways because:\n  \nI would need to learn the language if I were to be hired for the position anyways.\n \nIt would be nice to learn a new language and it's ecosystem even if I were to be rejected.\n \n So I poured my heart into learning Go and some select frameworks. I honestly thought I did well enough on the assignment considering it's my first real attempt to write something in Go that isn't absolutely trivial. I was not given any feedback for where I went wrong so I'm left in the dark here. Can any of you give me some feedback on my code? Really appreciate the time.\n https://github.com/brandonto/rest-api-microservice-demo\n EDIT:\n I'd like to thank you all for the enormous feedback. It's heavily appreciated. Never thought that I would have received so much in such a short time frame. I think I have a clear understanding of where the weak points lie now for future projects. I'll definitely be incorporating some of the suggestions in future projects. Perhaps even make changes to this one for the sake of completeness.\n As for the job, while I am a bit disappointed after sinking in hours into this project, I'm just treating it as part of the learning experience.\n I probably won't have the time to respond to any new comments. But I'd like to thank everybody again.\n Golang is a lovely language. :)\n    submitted by    /u/brandonto  \n [link]   [comments]",

In this way, when debugging, I can quickly locate which line is doing the complaining by clicking the link on my terminal.\n The code is here: https://github.com/Yifeeeeei/butterknife\n A quick example here, the comments show the output:\n package main ​ import ( \"github.com/Yifeeeeei/butterknife\" ) ​ func main() { a := \"a\" b := \"b\" butterknife.Print(a, b) // [main.go:10 main.main] ab ​ butterknife.Println(a, b) // [main.go:13 main.main] a b ​ butterknife.Printf(\"a:%s ,b:%s\\n\", a, b) // [main.go:16 main.main] a:a ,b:b ​ caller() } ​ func caller() { c := \"c\" d := \"d\" butterknife.PrintHierarchy(c, d) // [main.go:19 main.main] // [main.go:25 main.caller] // cd ​ butterknife.PrintlnHierarchy(c, d) // [main.go:19 main.main] // [main.go:30 main.caller] // c d ​ butterknife.PrintfHierarchy(\"c:%s ,d:%s\\n\", c, d) // [main.go:19 main.main] // [main.go:35 main.caller] // c:c ,d:d } ​ \n Right now it only supports 12 different styles (print with fmt/log, print/printf/println, with/without hierarchy), but I may add more functionalities to it later.\n    submitted by    /u/Parking_Bite_6416  \n [link]   [comments]",

Python frameworks usually provide built-in tools for authentication—everything from password validation and encryption to token expiration and third-party logins.\n Now, as I start developing my first API with Go Chi1, I've noticed the prevalent advice is to implement features from scratch. This shift has left me anxious about potential missteps and the risk of creating an insecure application.\n Do you all build auth from scratch when using Go Chi, or are there trusted libraries you rely on? How do you manage the complexity and ensure security? \n 1 Choosing Chi over the many other \"expressive, lightweight, API router\" was already a tough dilemma (and still I don't know if I chose the right tool).

          "description": "My girlfriend (a non-programmer) recently asked me what it means when programmers say that \"everything is just binary under the hood\". I started telling her how files don't intrinsically \"mean\" something and that programs simply do something with the bytes.\n For instance, an image utility assumes that if there is a file.png somewhere and its internal binary layout follows the PNG conventions then it must be an image and it will display that image on screen interpreting the bytes as RGBA values. However, other programs may interpret these same bytes differently and do other things with them.\n To demo that concept in the most obvious way, I created snapsound - a CLI (for now) that allows you to transform any MP3 file into a PNG image but retain the ability to play back the original sound. It's as simple as\n snapsound snap song.mp3 # Creates song.png snapsound play song.png \n If you're curious, the code is completely open source on GitHub. It can be easily installed with go intall.\n As a summation of this little research effort, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it is to write a program that plays sound in Go! The only thing is, I think that github.com/gopxl/beep (one of the deps) requires CGo to build on Linux, but MacOS and Windows are pure Go, no need for anything else (already tested both).\n    submitted by    /u/sharpvik  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would have to create a specific struct with all my functionality and a mock for it.\n What I am used to, and thought was a good design, was to have all fs methods to take a fs instance and given that go does do that for few things I was confused when I don't see that as just \"the way to do it\".\n Also, os.DirFS is admittedly broken for things that require dynamic paths or cross os compat, which makes it hard to use things like MapFS in your tests (MapFS looks so good on paper).\n Is there something I need to learn about this to get more comfortable or did I get to the same conclusion as everyone else?\n    submitted by    /u/5DBookshelf  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I've written pktstat-bpf, a simple replacement for ncurses/libpcap-based pktstat, using Linux eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) program, allowing packet statistics gathering even under very high traffic volume conditions, typically several million packets per second even on an average server. In this scenario (high volume, DoS attacks etc.) typically regular packet capture solutions start being unreliable due to increasing packet loss.\n By default it uses TC (Traffic Control) eBPF hooks with TCX attaching requiring at minimum Linux kernel v6.6 for both ingress and egress traffic statistics. Alternatively it can switch to XDP (eXpress Data Path) hook but with a consequence of losing egress statistics since XDP works only in ingress path. XDP mode due to XDP program to network interface attaching calls requires at minimum Linux kernel v5.9. Some distributions might have backported XDP/TC patches (notable example is Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel) and eBPF program might work on older kernels too.\n When using XDP on SmartNICs (100GE and more) it is possible to run in XDP Offloaded mode where XDP program loads directly on NIC with hardware XDP support and executes without using CPU, allowing wire speed statistics even on 100+Gbps speeds.\n At the end of the execution program will display per-IP and per-protocol statistics sorted by per-connection bps, packets and (source-IP:port, destination-IP:port) tuples, either in plaintext or as JSON.\n Program consists of the eBPF code in C and the pure-Go userland Golang program that parses and outputs final IP/port/protocol/bitrate statistics. Go part of the program uses wonderful cillium/ebpf library to load and run eBPF program, interfacing with eBPF map.\n I would be glad to hear about any improvements, bugs or otherwise.

          "description": "Hollo, Rustacians! \n I'm a backend developer, and I mainly use Go. I had read the Rust Book multiple times before, as I find it be insightful and interesting. Last week I had some free time, so I decided to work on my first actual project in Rust. It was a simple HTTP server. \n Overall, it was a fun experience. The type system is powerful. I felt at home with defining types and attaching methods to them. Enums are great as well. The Option type for gracefully handling null values and the Result type for more flexible error handling. It was satisfying to refactor my code to remove cloning or to use ? for early returns.\n Although, I found the compiler to be too much in the way. At some points, my speed grinded to a halt, trying to understand what I did wrong and how should I fix it. Granted, I'm new, and it's only natural to face such problems. But in many cases, I had to alter the solution I had in my mind to match what the compiler expected of me, which required so much mental energy. It was challenging in a fun way, but my productivity plummeted.\n Now that I'm fairly done with the project, it feels like I'm missing something about Rust. Surely, I'll continue to use it for my side projects, but I don't get the hype around it. What makes it so great? Is it just the challenge of writing more idiomatic code and constant refactoring, or is there something that Rust does that I'm not appreciating?\n    submitted by    /u/hossein1376  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there any objective reason for this?\n I honestly think it would be easier to simply have one type - String - and get rid of the str type. We could then have string slices as just borrows of the String type (&String).\n Is there any objective reason for having multiple string types in Rust? It seems to just lead to having to write lots of .to_owned()s, String::from()s and .as_str()s, as well as defining my function signatures as this:\n rust fn funcname<S: Into<String>>(string_param: S) \n Instead of just this:\n rust fn funcname(string_param: String) \n I thought it would be interesting to discuss the positives and negatives of having many string types in Rust, as for me I honestly don't see the positives!\n Any information is appreciated, Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/dylancode  \n [link]   [comments]",

The better you want your code to be, the more time/effort you need to invest. And the closer to perfection you get, the more it takes to push even further.

          "description": "I recently released my first ever proc-macro called pack_bools. It was a nice mix of frustration and joy as i had to navigate around syn, proc-macro2, quote and all the other tools. Some problems I encountered was that while syn was awesome for parsing the TokenStream, there was really no easy way to instantiate the AST structures from it, and I was kind of lost in how I was supposed to quote structures I had destructured. Also, it was quite hard to debug, I often got error messages like unexpected ,, but even with cargo expand it was sometimes invisible. But, I managed at last, and I am proud of the final product. Feedback highly appreciated!\n As a quick decription, the macro turns structs looking like this: ```rs use pack_bools::pack_bools;\n [pack_bools]\n [derive(Debug, Clone)]\n struct Config<'a> { output_name: &'a str, verbose: bool, pub use_colors: bool, original_file: &'a std::path::Path, legacy_mode: bool } ```\n into structs looking like this:\n ```rs\n [derive(Debug, Clone)]\n struct Config<'a> { output_name: &'a str, original_file: &'a std::path::Path, packed_bools: u8 }\n impl<'a> Config<'a> { /* getters and setters for the fields, with the same visibility as the fields */ } ```\n I also added lots of configuration options, inspired by serde, so you could do #[pack_bools(newtype)] to use the newtype pattern for the packed bool field, and much more. I looked around at crates.io a bit before making this, but didn't quite find anything just like this; I found some macros that generated bitfield-structs, and some macros that could expand a u8 field into multiple boolean fields with getters and setters, but I like the \"clean\" interface this crate provides.\n As said, feedback greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/CMDJojo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Its goal is to be a reliable & predictable but performant general purpose KV storage engine, for both smaller, but especially larger-than-RAM data sets. I have just released version 1, which stabilizes its data format for all future 1.x.x versions.\n Its design is heavily influenced by LevelDB/RocksDB’s architecture and generally yields similar performance. It has similar features, like:\n  \nRange and prefix searches with forwards and backwards iteration\n Data partitions (”Column Families” in RocksDB-speak)\n Cross-partition atomic write batches\n MVCC & Snapshot reading\n Adjustable durability guarantees\n Size-tiered (write-optimized), Levelled (read-optimized) and FIFO compaction (for ephemeral data)\n  \nCompared to other Rust storage engines (e.g. Persy, ReDB, …), Fjall has better write and space amplification across the board while still having competitive read performance. It also has very low startup times (~0.1s for 1 billion keys) and very short compile times (~3s on my machine, compared to ~90s for RocksDB).\n AMA here, on GitHub (star the repo ❤️, https://github.com/fjall-rs/fjall/discussions) or on Discord (https://discord.com/invite/HvYGp4NFFk)\n You can find and run Fjall and other Rust storage engines in my Rust storage engine benchmark: https://github.com/marvin-j97/rust-storage-bench\n I have also made a bunch (more coming soon) of examples demonstrating some practical usage: https://github.com/fjall-rs/fjall/tree/main/examples\n https://preview.redd.it/2gbybwtix01d1.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=52c10545f596abe75a5975a6f9952bffb34455dc\n    submitted by    /u/DruckerReparateur  \n [link]   [comments]",

It may not be the most idiomatic or modern thing to do however if it helps someone who has navigated such code bases for 40 years read my code better for his review that’s a tradeoff I’m willing to make.

He comes from a pure automotive background written in C for critical systems. That’s a wide jump compared to Rust. If I can learn what he learned over these years and how he applies it to Rust this is probably way more invaluable than any philosophical battleground.\n PS: Hungarian notation for function parameters isn’t nearly as bad as you make it out to be.

          "description": "Hello, coding newbie here,\n I've recently started learning Rust, mainly because a) it looks more fun than R (is R even considered a programming language? idk) which I begrudgingly use everyday and b) It seems like Rust's main focus is to minimize memory issues during runtime, which is of great interest to me. Right now I'm reading the Rust Book and having a lot of fun, but I know to truly step up my game I need to do a personal project.\n Thing is, I don't know what to do. I came across a random comment from a different subreddit talking about their setup, and it seemed like they made their own music player (I'm not sure if this is the correct term, what I mean is programs like foobar2000, itunes, etc), and that caught my eye. I like music, and I've never had a music player that perfectly suits my needs, so I think it'll be a pretty fun challenge to make one myself, but I'm not sure if it's going to be too hard for me.\n I pretty much have absolutely no coding experience. Yes, I've said I used C/C++ before, and because of my line of work requires some knowledge of Python I learned that as well, but I only know them at a surface level. So going back to the question - Will making a music player be too hard for me? Should I do something simpler first?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/MangiBoi  \n [link]   [comments]",

Optionally use gitignore to filter out some.\n I decided to write my own grammar for the markdown language, so it does not follow a specification 100%, but create an issue if you feel like it doesn't parse something correctly. Most of the common markdown syntax should be supported.\n If your terminal support some image protocol, it can also display images. Syntax highlighting is supported for some languages, and I am adding more as we speak.\n The biggest feature I have not seen other do, is a \"select link\" mode which allows you to scroll through the links in the file and follow them. Does not matter if it's a link to a heading, another file, or external URL to a website.\n Would be awesome to hear your thoughts.\n Edit: should have said it does not follow a specification 100%\n https://preview.redd.it/31aa4kmbdj0d1.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb1e4a9b912146a3a87ea0b6be84946ddacdcd80\n    submitted by    /u/The_Big_Hen  \n [link]   [comments]",

Those issues were found using valgrind - a memory debuting tool, which I now use to verify the Rust code compiled for .NET behaves correctly (the runtime can run under valgrind, if the right flags are set).\n I have also finished a round of extensive fuzzing (46 434 773 LOC of MIR test programs), which allowed me to find and patch many other issues (mostly related to floating-point numbers).\n Some issues still remain (13 out of 10 000 generated tests still fail, and the fuzzing tool I use does not check for every kind of bug), but a lot more Rust code should now compile properly.\n There is still a lot of work to do, but I wanted to share some of the progress.\n Also, the project has reached 1024(2^10) stars on GitHub! So, I would like to thank people for the amazing reception my project has had!\n If you have any questions/suggestions/whatever, feel free to ask.\n    submitted by    /u/FractalFir  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's written in Rust.\n The functionality of these apps is pretty similar, but the snappyness of yazi yet again reminds me how fast and rock solid Rust programs could be. I just don't understand why that's the case though—it's not like these apps do heavy number crunching or systems programming; they essentially provide a skin around terminal utilities such as ls and cd.

I find this way easier to read when parallelized; just painless to pattern match, scan over, and read across dimensions. The patterns are automatically provided to you, they're just there.\n What I want is this:\n [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 10] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 1] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 2] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 3] [src\\comb.rs:1260:3] count = [7, 0] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 4] // .. \n versus\n [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 10, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 1, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 2, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 3, ] [src\\comb.rs:1260:3] count = [ 7, 0, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 4, ] // .. \n This is actual dbg! output from my program, which also demonstrates how pretty printing can even be unnecessarily confusing. The lines [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count and [src\\comb.rs:1260:3] count are very similar, but in the single-line example it's much easier to spot the odd one out.\n I can copy-paste the source code into my own macro, but for a debug tool that I'd wanna use everywhere and anywhere it's just not the same. Is there an environment variable or some way to disable pretty printing everywhere?

It's a macro that takes a regular expression and produces two things:\n  \nA type containing the compiled internal representation of the regular expression, or as close as we can get given the tools available to us. This means no runtime errors and faster regex object construction.\n A type containing all of the named capture groups in the expression, and a captures method that infallibly captures them. Unconditional capture groups are always present when a match is found, while optional or alternated groups appear as Option<Capture>. This is a significant ergonomic improvmenet over fallibly accessing groups by string or integer key at runtime.\n  \nInterestingly, we currently don't do any shenanigans with OnceLock or anything similar. That was my original intention, but because the macro can't offer anything meaningful over doing it yourself, we've elected to adopt the principles of zero-cost abstractions for now and have callers opt-in to whatever object management pattern makes the most sense for their use case. In the future I might add this if I can find a good, clean pattern for it.\n This version is 1.0, but I still have plenty of stuff I want to add.

          "description": "I've worked in front-end web dev before, although 95% of my experience is in systems, machine learning, and gamedev as a hobby in c++, java, c#, python etc. I've definitely had an interest in doing web development and I have worked in a small team before to do a simple web app, but I found that the process was absolutely agonizing. \n ​\n Specifically, javascript seems to take my least favorite aspects of all the languages I know, and puts them together in one singular package seemingly designed from the ground up to make development as frustrating as humanely possible. \n ​\n I'm learning rust now but I consider myself a beginner still, and even though I don't think I'm quite past the initial growing pains with getting used to it, I am enjoying it and I'm all for trying out literally any alternative in existence to using javascript again. \n ​\n So as someone who knows nothing about it beyond skimming through the first page of google, do any of you actively use rust for front end? What's the current limitations? I can imagine countless benefits to using it over javascript, but are there any drawbacks to using rust for it over javascript? \n ​\n I know absolutely nothing about it, and my web dev knowledge overall is extremely rusty and likely outdated. But are you somehow working with frameworks like react but with rust? Or bindings? CSS? Any sort of generalized idea of how it works, what the experience is like and maybe some pointers on good resources for getting started would be really appreciated \n    submitted by    /u/Packathonjohn  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've found some post on this topic on stackoverflow, but unfortunately the solutions didn't helped in my case or maybe I misunderstood something while trying them out, so I came here to post my issue.\n use bevy::prelude::*; fn main() { App::new() .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins) .add_systems(Update, file_drag_and_drop_system) .run(); } fn file_drag_and_drop_system(mut events: EventReader<FileDragAndDrop>) { for event in events.read() { info!(\"{:? }\", event); } } \n I simply add an addition space after the ? character in the file_drag_and_drop_system function. Then press ctrl + s to save the change and after that use cargo run / cargo build. In both cases cargo recompiles all dependencies.\n The things I've tried so far:\n  \nSome people suggested, that the problem is that the build incremental isn't set to true.\n Others said, that setting the CARGO_TARGET_DIR environmental variable to a different folder might solve the problem.\n  \nconfig.toml in .cargo folder\n Prior to my issue I also set up the cargo.toml file after the Bevy getting started guide.\n [package] name = \"bevy_01\" version = \"0.1.0\" edition = \"2021\" [workspace] resolver = \"2\" # Important! wgpu/Bevy needs this! # NOTE: Remember to remove \"dynamic_linking\" before releasing your game! # Otherwise you will need to include libbevy_dylib alongside your game if you want it to run. # If you remove the \"dynamic\" feature, your game executable can run standalone.

Most of the interviews were 45 min affairs, solving Leetcode style problems (why ?? - that is a separate discussion).\n Sadly, I have come to realize rust is not ideal for this scenario, and going to switch back to C for these coding rounds. Most of these interviews involved working with 2D arrays, linked list, binary trees and such which would be relatively simple in C/C++.\n More context: I have had to spend a good part of the 45 min setting up these primitives, before even trying to solve the core algorithmic challenge. Few reasons:\n  \nThings like coderpad don't let you use external crates (e.g) there is one for 2D arrays\n Some questions involve removing elements from middle of lists in O(1) time. I had to hand roll a doubly linked list with unsafe pointer usage to achieve that, which itself easily filled the time\n  \nWith C/C++, these interviews used to go lot better, uh.

          "description": "Blog Post\n Hi everyone!\n I posted about Luminal a few months ago, and since then we've made significant progress in the CUDA and Metal compilers.\n For those who don't know, Luminal is a a deep learning library that uses composable compilers to achieve high performance. It's entirely written in Rust and orders of magnitude simpler than comparable ML frameworks.\n Recently we've been working on speeding up performance on Nvidia and Apple GPUs, which led us to write compilers capable of generating kernels on the fly. These kernels are compiled once and ran many times, and since the whole compute graph is known at compile time, we can get very aggressive with the kernel optimizations.\n We're adding tons more features (autograd landed a few weeks ago, so training is now possible!) so check out the blog post and the repo if you'd like to know more!\n    submitted by    /u/jafioti  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I really love working on Rust up until I have to add async to the mix. Lately I just avoid adding async at all costs because it just comes with so many caveats and gotchas that the effort is sometimes not worth the performance improvement. Some of the things that I absolutely find annoying:\n  \nasync is not part of rust, it's a library. The main one being Tokio with no real alternative. I applaud the work done on this but it all just feels horribly hacky. \n \nany time you have to use async you taint all your functions and types with it. As if dropping a bucket of paint (worse than paint but let's keep it civil) all over your code. It makes refactoring a horrible experience. As you crawl your codebase to make it async you eventually end up with an impossible task and have to find ugly alternatives (looking at you async fn in traits)\n \nwhile the rust compiler has been an amazing tool along the journey, it just fails miserably with async. It won't complain at all if you forgot to remove a blocking fs call in an async context and of course it will fail horribly at run time. And when the program eventually crashes, it will just render the most obscure stacktrace i've ever seen. FAR from the developper experience of vanilla Rust.\n \n Overall for such a great language with so many features, it just feels broken as soon as you put your finger in the async business. I ve been looking at the async improvement proposals but apart from async fn traits, i just don't see anything revolutionary that would make the experience better. \n At some point, shouldn't it just be part of the language if async Rust is to improve in a major way ? \n Disclaimer: I am not a Rust expert, but i ve been programming for 25+ years in many different languages.\n    submitted by    /u/ArnUpNorth  \n [link]   [comments]",

Blazor seems (I might be wrong) easier to learn and has more eye candy/UX type stuff in it.\n I'm cautious about picking it up because it seems like the big thing that I got out of reading this sub is that Microsoft has a habit of releasing a new technology/framework and then abandoning it if it doesn't get enough traction. Is that something that I should be concerned about with using a newer technology like Blazor? Or has Blazor received enough traction that the chances of that happening are low?

I have verified the connection through a web browser by running Flask on \"127.0.0.1:5000/video\". On the web browser, it works fine by displaying when sending a video file, but after changing the source of the frame, namely editing #VideoCapture(0) to a webcam it doesn't work. \n However, in my C# project, when I set the IP to 127.0.0.1 and the port to 8080, there's a second port number.

It provides an easy way to monitor sync status, get alerted on issues, and manage sync cycles.\n With this tool, you can:\n  \nView the status of your AD Connect sync cycles\n Get notified if delta or initial sync fails\n Manually trigger full or delta syncs\n Analyze sync errors to identify objects with issues\n And more!\n  \nIt's built with PowerShell so it should be easy to deploy in most AD/Azure environments. I'm actively developing it and welcome any feedback or suggestions.\n If you struggle with keeping your on-prem and cloud directories in sync, give AD Sync Manager a try. Let me know if you have any questions - I'm happy to help!\n Hopefully this tool saves you some time and headaches.

          "description": "I have about 7 years of experience as a software engineer. But what's interesting about my resume is that I have exclusively worked for Cybersecurity/Software Security companies in the past (some big names in the industry) but worked there exclusively as a software engineer. The thing is, I've been exposed to security stuff more than the average software engineer, but in no way am I a security engineer or an expert in anything security. So I've been casually applying to new jobs just to test the waters and see what's out there, and I've set my LinkedIn to \"open to work\" (hidden, of course), and I'm surprised by the number of companies wanting to interview me... as a software security engineer. I am NOT qualified for any of those roles and have not used any of the tools listed, but they still want to chat. On the other hand, I've applied to a number of pure SWE roles and nothing but rejections. If you're a software engineer with a cybersecurity background, the market's probably hot for you.

I've run quite a number of coding interviews over the past couple of weeks. It's a pretty simple problem, requiring basic knowledge of how to use a dictionary/hashmap, with a few different steps along the way that build on one another. We offer it in your choice of any major language, but 99% of candidates pick Python. The test is completely open book and the interviewers provide coaching as well. \n My issue is that over the past couple of weeks, we've interviewed THREE different developers from Capital One, all Senior+ level, and all of them have very clearly had absolutely ZERO coding exposure. In 45 minutes, none of them could fulfill a single unit test, such as throwing an error if a parameter was None, or throwing an error if a value wasn't in the dictionary. All of them were performing below what I would expect from a first year CS student, yet 2 claimed to have Masters in CS. \n What the hell is going on? Is Capital One some kind of complete joke organization? Surely not, right? Are these people lying about working there? If so, why did all three have Capital One as their current employer? Is there some kind of conspiracy? Anyone else experienced this?\n    submitted by    /u/Mediocre_Fly7245  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm completely surprise by just how much of a gap the tech stacks are. I was always told that the private sector is efficient, leaner, and decades advance. Man I could not be more wrong. My old job did not use git (internal decades old version control that was a nightmare using between just two people), the senior developers insisted on using notepad ++ (complain whenever they saw me using vs code), and I just started learning React and Spring boot (seniors insisted in vanilla JS and in house low code backend language). My mind is blown. Whenever I ask this multi billion dollar company why, the responses I always got was that \"new\" tech is for over hype FAANG companies not \"real\" companies that make products. \n I had so many issues with how navigating the ancient tech stacks with no documentation that made me feel like an idiot. We would spend months building an application from scratch and custom developing everything and I got so many complaints whenever I pointed out a limitation that our products were doing that was solve decades ago with new stacks. I was told that if I ever went anywhere else they be even more behind and there no point learning these skills. My Team didn't even code. They were all engineers with decades of outdated experience that they even admitted are so behind they could not work with modern stacks and just waiting for retirement. I was the only engineer under 40 on my team and could not aks anyone for help because they didn't even understand html.

I write really specific prompts, query different aspects if I don't understand the logic, prompt more and sometimes manually debug. Don't get me wrong, I am learning. I don't just throw in code until I understand what is going on and I also use GPT as my tutor to learn more about the tech stack.\n My worry though is that I'm not building up the problem-solving skills required by more senior engineers. Some of the logic GPT implements would have taken me ages to get right as a junior - but maybe that struggle is a necessary step for my development?\n Do more senior people here see there being long term issues with my approach? My concern with using GPT4 less is that I've set a standard at work which would probably drop massively without it. \n    submitted by    /u/chicagotool  \n [link]   [comments]",

My question is, is there a way to quantify how many of those professionals are actually decent coders? Or, a more straightforward question would be how many don't really know how to code?\n I worked as a tutor for 3 years in college and as a \"professor\" for 2 years in a bootcamp, and I can safely say that a good chunk of my students and classmates oversell themselves on LinkedIn and Resume by a huge margin. \n They go from running a ML model from a repo to adding \"Successfully designed and implemented a Visual transformer model for semantic segmentation, obtaining 98% IoU score while training on a dataset with underrepresented classes\" on their resume. Like bro I know you don't know what those words mean, I was literally trying to teach them to you yesterday.\n I don't doubt that the market is bad compared to previous years, but I do wonder how much of that comes from people who just started trying to get jobs that demand more knowledge. That has to skew the unemployed rates in tech somehow.\n This is a legit question and I'd love to hear different or similar perspectives.\n    submitted by    /u/APEX_FD  \n [link]   [comments]",

Long story short, I was working at a startup until last Friday, when my boss and I suddenly had a one-on-one call over Zoom. The conversation was basically about me having to be more \"responsible\" in my job. In other words, reply to messages on the weekends, work overtime (with no pay), etc. In a nutshell, I apologized, politely said no, and that I was going to work strictly within the hours I'm meant to: 9 to 5. I was pretty much fired on the spot shortly after that.\n You see, ever since I'd gotten hired, I'd made my boundaries very clear and never failed to set them up. Once 5pm hits, I'm out. Nobody can contact me for work-related reasons. I don't care if something is broken or whatever, I'm not fixing it until the next day or the following Monday (if it's a Friday). Unless you communicate to me that you're going to pay me overtime, I'm out. I have things to do in my private life, like taking care of family and simply hunkering down so that I have the energy to get back at it the next day.\n I think that boundaries are very important, especially if they ultimately help you to love your job more and to be able to have good mental health. To expect and to demand from employees, especially to their face, that they're meant to sacrifice their life for the company they're working for is a huge red flag in my book.

The approach here seems to rollback Trump-era tax breaks for corporations, and increase taxes on foreign profits therefore increasing local profits and disincentivizing outsourcing.\n \n ​\n All in all, the outsourcing problem seems complex and intertwined with very touchy facets of US commerce and labor, coupled with corporate desire for Short-Term profits. We cannot forget how the outsourcing plague in the mid-80s killed many American automotive manufacturing jobs and partly led to the demise of prosperous US Cities e.g. Detroit\n Do you think with the recent layoffs both in Tech and other fields that there is a likelihood that such legislation will be brought back up?

          "description": "I've been a web developer for the last 5-6 years(mainly frontend, but I worked with Node.js and express for a while). I work for a Big Tech company and I earn a reasonable salary. \n My problem is I'm exhausted and I feel I can't keep it anymore: We have a lot of strict deadlines and everyone works an unreasonable amount of hours.\n Last Friday, I had to work until 4AM to finish an urgent task that just appeared. This week, I worked 10-12 hours days to finish a bunch of important tasks. I'm not the only one - almost all of my team worked until midnight on tasks and codereviewsw.\n I don't know how to handle this because this is the way we worked for the last 3 years. My manager has very good intentions and he is a technical person, but I feel this is part of the problem.\n Our estimates goes like that: We need to build a popup with some tex and 2 buttons and call an API when \"confirm is clicked\".\n Me: It will take 3-4 days. Let's say 4 to be safe.\n Manager: 4 days for this ? It's simple enough, should be 2 days at most.\n Me: Yeah, but we want 100% coverage unit tests, use feature flags, the API is not ready yet and we use mock data, 2 people should review the code, we deploy on stage and prod, manual test everything (no QA). We even write e2e tests. \n In reality, even 4 days is not enough because some things are always unclear, and I have to clarify with 2-3 people and propose solutions. The codebase is very big and a lot of code has been untoched for years etc. So I end up working 12 hours/day to respect even the 4 days estimation, knowing my manager thinks is should be 2, which in fact should probably be 6-8 days because I'm not a robot.\n And I can't continue to work like that. I don't have time for myself, let alone personal development and learning new things.\n I don't know what to do. I talked with my manager a lot, and it's true we managed to complete the task in 4 days, but with me working 12+ hours and going above&beyound for this to happen. \n    submitted by    /u/InspectorDizzy3391  \n [link]   [comments]",

This incentivized innovation and fueled the rapid growth of tech startups. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 changed the game, which went into effect in 2022.

Post graduation I didn’t have anything lined up, so during the summer I worked as a bag boy at a local golf course, then eventually went back to a broker I interned for to work as an office assistant part time all while I continued to job search. Sent out hundreds of applications and got interviews here and there, but no luck getting hired. It was honestly such a draining experience. I couldn’t even get hired for a position paying 45-50k a year and a lot of them were customer service based roles, very entry level. Fast forward to now, I got hired to be an ‘engineer’ but the role is more so a project management role. Absolutely no experience in the field and they are willing to train me. One thing I learned about obtaining a job is it’s all about who you know and if the timing is right. The guy whos position I am taking over got promoted and I happen to know someone within the company which definitely helped. One in-person interview and three weeks later they sent me an offer, which definitely caught me off guard.

I have seen mind numbingly stupid takes from people who work at Google,Meta, Snap, Uber, Pinterest, Two Sigma etc. If brain dead morons can crack LC and get into FAANG so can you.\n So if you are struggling with LC just stick with it. I guarantee you it's not an intelligence thing. Several Meta employees have confirmed they basically just memorized the top tagged Meta LC list. These people are not high iq geniuses. If you need to memorize or do the same top tagged problems over and over then do so. Some companies , cough...Meta, expect you regurgitate answers anyways so don't feel guilty or shame with having to memorize answers for the most common LC hards asked in interviews.\n    submitted by    /u/Apprehensive-Income  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently got contacted by a Big G recruiter. They now send over a Hiring Assessment consisting of 100 Agree/Disagree questions. I pass that, so I assumed I would go to the tech screen next. A week passes and the recruiter finally sends me an email telling me I need to \"continue developing my skills\" and no feedback. Their auto-email also mentions that I have a 6-9month reapply waiting period. I'm fine getting denied, but don't tell me to improve my skills when you reached out to me and I haven't even done the interview yet...\n It is insane that some recruiters hold the entry door for some of the highest paying jobs in our field. Guess I now have a re-apply waiting period due to a bad recruiter. \n P.S> Seems like Big G is even outsourcing recruitment to outside the US.

It is a flat hierarchy for the engineers with one Engineering VP. Recently, they told one of my work friends that other departments have people be held accountable for mistakes and publicly talk about “lessons learned” and things to make us grow. They said they have no insight on what the tech team does (we are the only full remote team) and want us to be like the other depts and talk about our failures, what we did wrong, what bugs we caused, and how we fix them. This seems so strange. We will sometimes have these talks internally with our own teammates but to publicly put us on blast in front of the whole company, or at least the top dogs? They don’t even mention our successes, why they hell do they want our failures? But anyway, I have a meeting with these execs tomorrow to “pick my brain” and because I was made aware of this beforehand, I’d love some advice on a good rebuttal that won’t get me fired or have a target on my back.\n Edited to add: The CTO either resigned or was fired, we don’t actually know since it was very ominous and quick.

They are focused on quality, they care about the software and where it is going. Non-technical managers want things done in X amount of time and you need to explain to them like they’re 5 why it hasn’t been done yet. \n How am I supposed to respect someone and essentially report to them when they know nothing about technology? \n These are roles to whip the employees to work harder, slaves overlooking other slaves. They’re there to force devs to give themselves deadlines and burn themselves out. \n Yes, there are also technical managers who aren’t good managers. Imo you need to be both good at management and good at technology, if you’re good at just one of these, you’re automatically not good enough. Your lack in the other area will show up. The definition of a leader, to me, is someone you look up to, who can do at least everything that you do and more. \n This industry is a bit of a joke, not surprised that people can’t take us seriously when we call ourselves “engineers”.

It's a bit awkward but I decided to keep mine on anyway.\n Is this very common in your experience?\n I assume they might do it for bias reasons (definitely had women not wanting to get judged because of their appearance and I get that from what I've seen in our field) or just don't feel like it. I didn't push for it as I generally tend to have my team decide by themselves if they turn their camera on during meetings and glad to do as much as possible in Slack. But for a first time meeting people I still find it super hard to... bond with them and then later tell them apart. Or even hire someone without ever having seen their face once.\n Last time I interviewed people for my team a few years ago I didn't notice this, most just seemed to turn on the cam without having it explicitly stated.\n EDIT: \n For the next rounds I'll definitely see that I explicitly state \"video call\". I was just surprised people don't do this by default but perhaps I'm just becoming boomer :). But there's a \"give a talk and we discuss\" round anyway, so I hope at least there they'll turn their cam on.\n I should probably add, this is for a very senior/scientific role, so we also have to meet customers at least virtually, pitch projects, give talks, hold webinars, perhaps go to a conference etc.\n    submitted by    /u/met0xff  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So recently I decided I was going to replace my LinkedIn profile pic since my current one is outdated. While I hadn't yet replaced it I left it blank and suddenly received 2 unsolicited messages from recruiters and 2 responses from other job listings in the span of 1 week. For context, I had spent 6 months and ~800 job apps which I know isn't that many but I haven't even gotten a phone screen. My last and only interview was 6 months ago, where I made it to the final round and was rejected because they had an applicant with more experience than me (I had over 2 YOE and it was a junior role FML). \n Anyway I'm starting to question the timing of these recruiter messages. I don't think there was anything wrong with my profile picture. The only critique I could think of is that it was a bit outdated so I might have looked too young. I don't really want this to turn into a r/RoastMe post so just bear with me and assume I am just an average looking person. \n I think the more likely scenario is that there is some algorithm that LinkedIn uses that detects when users become less engaged on the platform and then decides to rapidly promote that user into reengaging again. This may come across as tinfoil hatty but I do think this is the most likely outcome since the timing does not make any sense and I haven't read anything to suggest the job market suddenly improved a ton. I am curious if other people have had similar things happen to them like this.\n Also an FYI I am a White Male U.S. Citizen with 2.5 YOE in a popular tech stack in a west coast city. \n    submitted by    /u/nysoxfan01  \n [link]   [comments]",

(keeping it real)\n Literally would sit down and try to learn languages like Java, Python, HTML/CSS.\n Couldn’t do it because it was so boring.\n What I did to fix this was literally hop on structured learning platforms like Sololearn (free) and Codecademy ($150/year).\n Then of course it still wouldn’t work. \n Same thing would happen, I would just continue to procrastinate and feel bored.\n To combat this, I simply screen recorded myself coding and explaining what I was doing.\n Then I uploaded those videos onto YouTube.\n Knowing that I was being recorded made me focus more and building an audience on YouTube doing this (you would be surprised) kept me motivated to keep coding.\n This is also something you could eventually monetize, but even if your YT doesn’t grow, you’ll learn how to code and program.\n I hope this helped a few of you. I wish someone introduced this to me a long time ago.\n Good luck everyone!\n    submitted by    /u/Interesting_Two2977  \n [link]   [comments]",

But basically I was a lazy student and pretty much just chose Comp Sci since I thought it was one of the majors people took, when they didn't care, so I pretty much just graduated with a Comp Sci degree having never studied, and didn't learn until later that Comp Sci is actually considered one of the harder majors.

MIT also doesn’t use 4.0 as their GPA scale, its 5.0. You can backtrack and find this person on LinkedIn, then try finding them on the MIT alum database that’s publicly available, the only person with that name did not major in CS nor did they graduate when this profile claimed they did. There’s no published research mentions on google scholar either for this guy, incredibly unlike for a stanford phd.

I'm not sure what exactly the expected behavior is supposed to be.\n I've seen multiple sources say that, after enabling the LCD, the very first scanline on the first frame has different timings from other scanlines, but I can't find timing documentation for this anywhere.\n Here's what I've gathered so far:\n  \nThe PPU starts in mode 0 (HBlank) after the LCD is enabled. There is no mode 2 on the first scanline.\n After mode 0, PPU advances to mode 3, which is unusual.\n The PPU advances from mode 3 to mode 0, and remains in this mode until the end of the scanline.\n After scanline 0, the PPU resumes normal operation (mode 2, mode 3, mode 0, etc)\n The PPU starts 2 t-cycles \"late\"?\n The LCD is blank for the first frame after it is enabled\n  \nWhat is the timing for scanline 0? How long does the PPU stay in each mode?\n Are any interrupts requested during the first frame after enabling the LCD?\n How is the PPU started 2 cycles \"late\" if it starts in mode 0 and jumps straight to mode 3? How can it be late if it starts in HBlank?\n Is there any documentation out there that describes this behavior?\n I had a look at Higan, and it runs mode 0 for 72 clocks, then mode 3 for 172 clocks (according to Kevtris this might need to be 173.5), then back to mode 0 until 456 clocks have elapsed.

I can't imagine that this is performant. But maybe I'm wrong. It would be really interesting to know what black magic is used in those emulators.\n    submitted by    /u/Zeusenikus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have an idea that I have never seen implemented or discussed anywhere and I wonder if it would be possible to do it. I'm not talking about motion interpolation for 2D video which you hear a lot about these days. I'm thinking about calculating extra frames by interpolating the 3D coordinates of triangle vertices to boost the framerate of any 3D game without modding it. Even the 60Hz video output of many game consoles would not be a limit, you could just calculate more frames to reach 144Hz or any value your computer can keep up with.\n One crucial thing that needs to be done for this is to identify which vertex in one frame belongs to which vertex in the next. I don't know how the GPU of consoles usually work with triangles and vertices on a technical level. Maybe the games just send the updated coordinates for each vertex, then it would be easy. If games send completely new triangle information (with color and texture information) every frame, then I guess it would be a lot harder. But I think it should still be possible by using some heuristic that looks at the size, texture and change in position and finds a mapping that results a (approximated) minimal overall change in size and position (and no texture change) of triangles. And if the changes become to big (when an object moves or grows really fast) and the mapping becomes too ambiguous, it would not do the interpolation for the affected triangles. That calculation would of course create a performance overhead but I feel like with modern GPUs it should work for old games.\n I understand that creating 60 fps hacks gives better results and is a cleaner approach, but it has to be done individually for each game and is not trivial and I don't know if you even can go beyond 60 fps with this, so I think it would be nice to have this automatic fps increase option in emulators (or even old non-emulated games) to play everything with 144 fps. What do you think of this idea?\n    submitted by    /u/Abrissbirne66  \n [link]   [comments]",

I never really had that much of a problem getting the graphics to look correct, I even eventually figured out EGA/VGA which was a nightmare. I just can't seem to figure out the correct way to draw Pac-Man though! (Testing with Midway arcade ROMs)\n I'm getting the tile data. If I use the two bits per pixel I get from character ROM and just treat that as a grayscale image, I get a totally recognizable display! I see the words on the title screen, I see the maze. That part's working.\n  charval = ROM_gfx[val * 16 + idx]; pixel[0] = (charval & 0x01) | ((charval & 0x10) >> 3); pixel[1] = ((charval & 0x02) >> 2) | ((charval & 0x20) >> 4); pixel[2] = ((charval & 0x04) >> 3) | ((charval & 0x40) >> 5); pixel[3] = ((charval & 0x08) >> 4) | ((charval & 0x80) >> 6); \n Where val is a byte out of the char RAM and ROM_gfx[] is the character ROM array. No problem!\n But what's the correct way to get the full color? There's color RAM just above char RAM. I believe I'm supposed to use the same offset in there for the tile as I do for the char RAM. Then left shift it by 2 and OR the values from the pixel array above?\n Then there's a color ROM and a palette ROM. I thought I was supposed to index palette ROM from the result I got from the above, and then I use that value to index the color ROM which gives me the RGB values?\n That's what I'm trying, and it just looks like a mess. Completely wrong.\n What am I missing? I thought this one would be simple lol. I can't seem to find a clear explanation anywhere.\n    submitted by    /u/UselessSoftware  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi. I want to write my own NES \"cartridge decoder\" that will serve as a helper tool during development of my NES emulator. One of it's capabilities will be dissasembly of a PRG ROM. However the thing with these ROMs is that data is mixed up with the code and it can look roughly like this:\n <some data>\n <couple of instructions>\n <some data>\n <couple of instructions> \n And etc. So if you are looking at compiled binary you really have no way of telling whether given byte is treated as instruction, instruction operand (or part of it) or data used by the program.\n I came up with 2 approaches how I could tackle this:\n  \nLazy approach - Just interpret everything as instruction (of course by taking their variable length into account)\n Better approach - Interpret the program, not exactly by executing it but going instruction by instruction, tracking where it jumps or which subroutines it calls. While processing branch instructions process both cases. Read interrupt vectors and interpret them as well until reaching RTS instruction. Everything else would be considered raw data and dead code would also fall into that category. Basically disassembler would go instruction by instruction to determine where code execution can lead to distinguish instructions from the data.\n  \nI never specifically wrote a dissasembler, so I would like to know if my ideas are at least good, or there are better, more reliable approaches to that out there.\n    submitted by    /u/Sea-Work-173  \n [link]   [comments]",

Combined with enough workers this gets test suite run times down to seconds (https://brisktest.com/demos).\n I've had a lot of requests for people who want to run Brisk in their own infrastructure and so I've gone ahead and open sourced it all. You can now run Brisk yourself both locally (for development/testing purposes) and in your own cloud for free.\n Currently we have dedicated support for Node JS, Ruby, Python and Go test suites and we integrate with Github Actions, CircleCI etc, Bitbucket etc. Adding additional test runners for other languages is also straightforward. \n We also integrate with your IDE so you can access the full power of your CICD pipeline from your local machine after each save. \n Let me know what you think.\n https://github.com/brisktest/brisk\n https://docs.brisktest.com/\n    submitted by    /u/reillyse  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been studying for the CKA cert, however after thinking about it some more, CKAD is starting to make more sense to me.\n The continuous trend in k8s administration is through managed services like EKS and GKE. Rarely do I see job openings of bare metal or administrating a cluster through other means. While yes there are still cases where you need to debug the control plane, it's extremely rare and 99% of the time, the associated cloud provider has support. \n And yes, it's extremely important to know how the control plane component works. But, I find that my personal experience with K8s is more in the development and application architectural side, than it is in debugging etcd or the api server.\n Does anyone else feel the same?

The only issue is customers of Operations Technology despise Internet Connectivity. Without Internet Connectivity, working with Cloud-Native technologies like Containers is a massive pain.\n So as a common way to solve such a problem I was working with Ansible to setup systems with a Docker Registry and then using container tarballs to do the following:\n  \ndocker pull images from registries\n docker save to create tarballs\n docker load to extract them on the main gateway\n docker tag to make sure I rename it for making it compliant with the registry\n docker push to registry\n cleanup etc.\n  \nThis works well for a single architecture system e.g. amd64. Now I have devices which also are arm64 based and the registry isn't smart enough to generate manifests to let devices determine which blobs to pull based on the underlying architecture.\n I tried Skopeo today and in the lab I was able to sync an Image from Docker Hub to a testing registry in 10s.. No docker gymnastics involved.\n If i need to create tarballs - Skopeo can do that. If I need to push tarballs to a registry it can do that too. Cherry on Top, no need to have docker installed on your local machine where some development is needed.\n I will combine Ansible and Skopeo to get a large leap on the product I am working on.\n The only thing I need to figure out is to generate a Manifest List for multi-arch container images available on Docker Hub\n Amazing tool, would recommend for air-gapped scenarios.\n    submitted by    /u/dugindeep  \n [link]   [comments]",

How bad is it really to run the Application without the agent, and just push with the SDK?\n Q: Is the push model much worse than the pull model?

Don’t get me wrong, i am always up for learning new tech - I learned Go and wrote tf providers and k8s operators at my previous places and was a python/c++ dev for 5 years before that but i don’t get/like scala at all - and the codebase is highly opinionated. \n I also think that because of the principle engineer, we end up taking so much application development work that should be delegated to the application teams.\n Anyways, i am very frustrated and don’t really see the way out except finding a new job.\n Rant over!\n    submitted by    /u/OkBeacon  \n [link]   [comments]",

My first job was as a general SysAdmin, then I moved into being a MySQL DBA. I got into DevOps / AWS between 2008 - 2014 -- AWS, EC2, Chef, Puppet, etc. -- but took a break to run a side business outside the industry, which ended up turning into the last 10 years of my life.\n There was a software component to my side business, and I've kept up with some small consulting projects, so the skills I had are still sharp, but I haven't kept up as much on what's new.\n I remain pretty well-versed in MySQL/Postgres (RDS/Aurora/otherwise) and AWS in general, though I'm not certified. Bash skills are still solid, Python skills are not. My Ruby skills are decent, but no Node experience.\n My original plan was to take a Kubernetes course. I generally figure things out pretty quickly. But with the changing landscape -- salaries, everything being AI -- I'm wondering what I should focus on next. I'm probably going to be looking for a full time job come September, and wondering where I should spend most of my time. AWS Bedrock? Kubernetes? Learning how to build LLMs? Teaching myself Node & Python?\n Appreciate any feedback anyone can provide.\n Also curious if people feel that being physically in the Bay Area can hurt or help your chances of finding work. I have the option to move there.\n TLDR: Great at bash, awk & sed; decent at CloudFormation, but just learned what kubectl was yesterday. \n    submitted by    /u/manlymatt83  \n [link]   [comments]",

Help desk, network admin, security analyst, sys admin, info sec manager. \n My bachelors is in IT and my masters is in cybersecurity. I recently started working with the dev team at my company in a devops role. I’m building docker images, automating their builds using gitlab-ci and kaniko, threw in some SAST and container scanning with acceptance criteria, then using azure app service to deploy, wrote some firewall rules. \n Kinda just learning on the go but absolutely loving it. And I’m the kind of person when I dive into something I dive in with both feet. So I’m flying through KodeKloud in my spare time, learning Kubernetes, getting stronger devops concepts, getting more proficient with Linux and bash scripting. I’m doubling down by using code academy to learn some basics in web development, (already knew basic python syntax) gonna start building a web app with a flask backend. Then for fun I was gonna deploy my own web app with a database in my minikube lab. Maybe host the database in the cloud and make them communicate securely just to make my environment more realistic. \n all this while still working with the team at work and applying things im learning to my work. \n Nothing seems extremely hard. like it's a ton to learn, but absolutely not impossible. but then i come here and everyone talks like if you didnt start as a software developer youre gonna be useless in devops. i understand im still extremely new in my journey, and i already have a good background in fundamentals so maybe its coming easier to me then a random guy that googled “high paying jobs”, but am i wrong to think i can be good in the field? This sub constantly has me feeling like im wasting my time and no company will ever take me seriously because I don’t know how to leetcode. Hell I’m even willing to learn how to leetcode lmao.

Plus, we’re enabling mobile teams to instrument any software component or service using OpenTelemetry and gather the data in the Embrace backend.

I am stuck in my current job because there is nothing more to do. I have revamped the entire infrastructure of my (medium sized - multi million) company, terraforming the infrastructure, managing and improving deployments, improved kubernetes, docker images, pipelines, etc…\n Now my company hired 3 new devops engineers for a different company because they are cheaper but s the tasks go to them. Because of that I had a lot of free time, but I’m actually losing motivation for devops. Automating used to be my passion but now I’m in a bit of a rut\n Due to certain personal circumstances I can’t leave the job at current moment; although I thought about it because I’m kinda reaching the ceiling of this company.\n If anyone has any advice, I would appreciate it\n    submitted by    /u/zodiac-azrael  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been asking my software friends what pain points they experience in the cloud deployment aspect of DevOps, especially when it comes to creating and managing cloud infrastructure. \n I wanted to utilize my knowledge in ML and AI to perhaps enhance or improve DevOps workflows but I need to learn and listen to what the actual difficulties DevOps Engineers face in companies that I could perhaps explore as a hobby. \n It would be amazing if people share problems that DevOps Engineers see could be solved by implementing some codebase integration with RAG and then perhaps using retrieved info with LLMs to make informed decisions? \n I recently created a short demo which converts natural language queries to a runnable terraform deployment (The agent I coded for this hobby project also fetches relevant config parameters that might be needed for the Terraform Code).

Or are they saying they should create a copy of their repository in GitLab/GitHub and pay the costs of two providers just to use the pipeline? Currently I'm in a team using Jira and Confluence so I think it makes sense for us to go with BitBucket since code review can easily be done in a way that ties to user stories and it is discounted with our other Atlassian products. Why don't more people that use Jira use BitBucket? And what is the best option for a company using Jira? Do we copy our BitBucket repo to GitLab, do we use GitLab and use a Jira integration but still not have our code review be able to be tied to user stories, or do we use a CI/CD manager like Jenkins which most people agree is complex to manage?

The API is composed of micro-services. It does biz logic things like user management, fetching results, ingesting media inputs and passing them into our core engine which is owned by MLEs... \n We are a small startup, I am the first and only devops engineer at the moment. I initially wrote authorization and owned load balancing into the system but out of feeling that I was spread too thin I passed this ownership off to the fullstack team. My sense over the past few months is that the fullstack team shouldn't ideally own load balancing and authorization, they tend to do things really quickly and dirtily and I suppose I'm not fully comfortable with their approach. My sense is that this should be owned by security minded SREs who are already responsible for production.\n Can you guys assist in providing insight into my potential blindspots?

An awesome paradigm at the base layer and so much interesting built on top of it.\n Observability - almost a science in itself and plenty to get into (or related to) be it monitoring, alerting, analytics, service management. \n Platform management - building out a consumable platform, kinda like being a developer for developers.\n Architect - the problem I have with this is developers are going to have their own software architects doing system design that the may overlap already with the infra side. Also many expect engineers to have software architects skills anyway. So where does that leave the cloud/DevOps architect? I feel there is not much mileage in this path.\n Any others? As each year passes the more I think it is not a good idea to stay in the middle as a generalist and time to pick a path.\n    submitted by    /u/gowithflow192  \n [link]   [comments]",

And they can't debug their own work because they don't understand how it works either, so I have to troubleshoot it as well.\n Another issue I have is during code reviews, people cannot explain why they wrote their code a certain way. They just say \"that's what chatgpt output\". And it's usually just several long functions with minimal thought going into the design or how it will work in the bigger picture. One project is using 3 or 4 different libraries for making http requests at this point because chatgpt isn't consistent in which it uses and devs arent checking to see what is already in place. \n The other thing people started doing is responding with a copy paste from chatgpt explaining the design when answering my PR comments. Even if the explanation feels nonsensical from my perspective, they just copy paste spam clearly generated replies until I give up and pass the review over to someone else.\n Ive talked to my boss but hes drunk on AI hype and thinks this is the future. I explain these issues but he thinks I am just trying to force people into doing things the old way. His favorite thing to say is that people originally opposed using compilers and wanted to hand write assembly for a long time, which i find pretty annoying.

Hopefully, based on the upvotes, this is fine :) \n I have finally read all the responses in that thread about the tips for writing better code. A lot of people mentioned testing, but the opinions themselves were really different. \n My recent project proved to me that unit tests are very tricky to get right. It's very simple to write them and increase the coveted code coverage so that fellow devs can applaud and be confident that something good is happening. That said, a lot of tests are either meaningless in that they pass whatever what, or so flaky that maintaining them becomes such a burden that you just want to delete them. \n Recently, it has happened several times that I just ditched all unit tests and mocks and fired testcontainers with a real PG instance. \n Of course, unit tests have their place for business logic where no external dependencies are involved. In such cases, it also helps to use fuzzy testing and property-based testing. \n Now I am rereading the wonderful article by Fowler on tests, but I am sure some of you might have a lot of insightful things to say on the topic.\n    submitted by    /u/dondraper36  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm of the mind that if you have 2 variables or sets of data that should ALWAYS be the same, that you SHOULD (assuming some huge hurdle) that you should have a source of truth that feeds both or one passes it to the other.\n For example, if you click a button (\"foo\") and need to call a method (\"bar\") that passes that button's value to somewhere else, you should change the code so \"foo\" is in a variable somewhere and passed to \"bar\" as opposed to hard coding \"foo\" inside \"bar\"\n But this can obviously end up with writing more code so that the foo variable is getting passed around.\n So this tech lead seems to be of the mindset that you should always change the least amount of code possible regardless of anything else.

          "description": "Okay, let me clarify. In the thread about overrated concepts, several people mentioned Uncle Bob and clean code. Again, the principles behind the rules are very useful. After all, software engineering is fighting complexity almost by definition. \n That said, because of the tone and Uncle Bob's authority, those out-of-nowhere rules like \"methods can't be longer than 5 LOC\" or \"methods can't have more than one parameter\" became associated with clean code. \n A much better book on writing great code is A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout. What I like the most is that John has a very nuanced view on software design, and instead of magic numbers and prohibitions he comes up with useful ideas like deep/shallow modules. This single chapter made me rethink how I write code and think about complexity. \n As for less philosophical rukes, there's a favorite of mine that in my opinion tremendously improves average code. It's guard clauses or, simply speaking, early returns. I know, there used to be the opinion rooted in old programming languages that a routine must have only one return. This is fortunately no longer true, and in the language I use 99% of the time (Go) , returning early is one one of the common best practices. \n What are your favourites?\n    submitted by    /u/dondraper36  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’d like to recommend this book I’ve read a while back (Chip & Dan Heath - Decisive). Many things I've read there continue to echo in my head.\n So this is a book about decision making. The authors researched business decision making primarily, but many of the findings make sense in the context of decisions that developers, especially lead devs regularly make.\n The book mentions common known biases in decision making, such as the famous sunk cost fallacy or loss aversion. But what I like really about the book is that it goes way beyond that and focuses on the process of decision making.\n One of the recommendations is to apply a wide context. For example, instead of asking whether the team should do a certain refactor and discussing pros and cons, a better question is: what can the team do in the X engineering hours granted to code maintenance.\n Another interesting advice was that decision makers should actively reach out for opinions that oppose their preferred choice. If you don’t see any disadvantages with the decision, then chances are you didn’t spend enough time to discover your blind spots, and efforts should be made to at least give a chance for counteropinions.\n Another practice mentioned is preparing for failure: what happens if the decision doesn’t bring the expected outcome? If we start this refactor, what do we do if it gets more complicated than we anticipated? When do we stop it? Do we have a clear way of undoing changes, if necessary? What if our changes designed to improve performance turn out to have a catastrophic effect in production?\n I also really like the pragmatic approach they’ve taken: they collected and analyzed hard data to see what decision making practices correlate with better outcomes.\n Have you read other books that are not really focused on software engineering, but contributed to your practices?\n    submitted by    /u/my_dev_acc  \n [link]   [comments]",

The thread has some insightful stories and arguments, but I still feel like the hype around microservices did the industry a bad favor. \n MongoDB (closely related to the PG point below). I have several times heard my colleagues discuss MongoDB and want to use it at work. Every single time, my immediate reaction was to ask why and suggest using Postgres instead with its JSONB columns.\n Clean/hexagonal architecture - I think that the underlying ideas (dependency inversion, single responsibility and the rest of SOLID) are great ways to reason about architecture. That said, the marketing hype about clean architecture seems to have created a cult of religious fans to the point where abstractions and layers of indirection are created just because that follows what Uncle Bob wrote in his article. Also, the popular argument of \"now we can swap the database every day\" is so unrealistic in my opinion. I don't really remember ever needing to unexpectedly swap a database. Maybe, I'm wrong. \n Underrated: \n Postgresql - even though it has a great reputation these days, I still think a lot of people would benefit a lot from knowing more about its features and potential. My personal favorite is using PG's FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED feature to implement a simple queue. Whenever I need a task queue, I immediately reach for it. \n Presentation/writing skills: I am not a great presenter and speaker myself, but the more I work as a software engineer, the more I realize that being concise, accurate, and engaging in your writing/speaking is a valuable asset.

Been there 3.5 years, was promoted once, and given lots of recognition and leadership.\n  \nI am going to retire either in 2 months or 8 months to be a stay at home parent.

And also a decent guy who I'm relatively close with.\n \nI'm the embodiment of the bus factor. I work on a critical team, am the only one with deep experience in the product and code, and it's a pretty niche bit of technology. I haven't preferred it be this way, but we've generally been understaffed and overworked on executive priorities since we were acquired. This is just to say, I know it'll be hard on the team when I leave, and they're going to try and get me to stay.\n \n My question:\n I'm considering letting my manager know that I'll be leaving in X weeks (still not for sure when I'll give notice), but that I'd be open to staying on for up to 8 months, under the condition that I work a lot less (say 10 hours/week) with the expectation that I'd help KTLO, stabilize the team and backfill my role. \n But I won't stay for 8 months without a deal like that, for various family and personal reasons. \n I can imagine many reasons the org wouldn't go for something like this.

I also don't like meetings that aren't directly feeding into meeting some objective or satisfying some stakeholders needs. I also like everything be fully remote. \n So no team building lunches, games, axe throwing, board game night, etc. No stand ups, no weekly team meetings, etc. Retros are async, design meetings and discussions are scheduled as required around specific topics, and I do optional 15m one on ones with people who like that environment for asking questions or giving feedback. People pair on work when they want, but they can also work alone if they want. Basically just trusting staff to work how they want and achieve whatever is most urgent or needed, and flag stuff when it isn't clear.\n The result I have found is that people on the team can do 4 or 5 hours of work on their own schedule and exceed the output of teams doing +8 hours work in office. So of course I am happy with people taking this extra time and using it for their own purposes.\n However, I know some people really feel like these kinds of team building activities are important for building team cohesion.

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I've been tasked with creating a payment application at my company that acts as an \"Adyen wrapper\" (and can work with other payment gateways as well). The goal is to develop an abstract API that centralizes payment requests and forwards them to the appropriate payment gateway for processing. Essentially, this is similar to what Adyen does with various payment processors.\n One of our senior developers suggested using a microservices architecture for this project. In this setup, one microservice would receive the payment requests, and there would be separate microservices for each payment method we use. These microservices would then communicate with the respective payment gateways.\n I believe that Adyen and other payment gateways might use a similar approach in their systems.\n Here are my questions:\n  \nHow do payment gateways handle communication between their internal services?\n Is the communication entirely synchronous, with microservices calling each other using HTTP?\n Do they use message queues? If so, how do they ensure the process appears synchronous to the client? For example, when I make a payment request to Adyen, they return the status in the same response.\n  \nThanks for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/RaphaS9  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some team members weren't familiar with this so we had some workshops and I wrote up some detailed documentation and everything seemed good.\n But one developer in particular is basically refusing to change and just does what he used to, so it becomes a hassle for him to clean up his branch when he creates a merge request, and this has to be done for him because he claims that rebasing doesn't work for him and he can't force push, etc. This is in addition to him continuing to complain that the new way is wrong.\n It doesn't help that our project manager is seeing this and is starting to suggest we rethink the strategy if there are so many problems, etc.\n I don't want to get into the pros and cons of the branching strategy, because I don't think that's the underlying problem, but how do you guys deal with stubborn developers like this?

A bad one is a bottle neck.\n So I was in the unfortunate situation where i had to lead a team who overall lacked the right kind of skillset for what the project demanded.

Granted long term there are 5 engineers who can work on it vs 1, which is positive, but still, it was a struggle.\n I have the hunch that building a core / skeleton and then having people explore / solve isolated problems is the right way to go, but then people find excuses or avoid diving in the codebase. \n    submitted by    /u/dangling-putter  \n [link]   [comments]",

Plus any associated blob storage NoSQL dbs as well (using ids from the relational database). Let's ignore the implications of distributed systems and stay solely within a singular db.\n The tricky part was, how do you stop engineers submitting code that breaks this rule? For a more concrete example, a dev adds a new or modifies an existing sql table FOO with no foreign key to the previously concerned tables, but on event creation, FOO will now have some event related data (possibly transformed/hashed so it's completely unrecogniseable from original event data, but must still be deleted)?\n It's simple to say Code Review, but I'm looking for basically as robust a solution here, preferably as part of the CI pipeline (eg github actions).

There's one group of (sharp) senior devs that have been working with it a long time, and a second off-shore group that is significantly less experienced. Experienced group likes one IDE; new group has been told to use a different IDE (and a few rebels (me!) use a third).\n I have two main concerns that I'm hoping the tool can help with: code formatting consistency across multiple IDEs (PR noise), and coding apprenticeship factors (\"Don't copy that, it's not a good example\"). I am tired of PRs where I'm looking for NPEs, seeing 'if' statements that are 8 levels deep, and getting distracted by code moving from one line to the next because the line continuation moved. I'm hoping a lint-as-you-type tool would help with these types of issues, but I'm a bit overwhelmed on how to push it out. The new group is probably amenable, but the old group maybe not so much.\n Likely a phased approach is best, carrots over sticks, but what to prioritize in phase 1? Server side counts, or just let early adoption happen locally amongst the willing? Identifying & disabling the rules that generate too much noise? Editor freedom?\n Edit: I ran a full scan on the repo today.

Whatever the title is -- sometimes it's called Business Analyst too I think.\n Basically, I have never met even one good PM (or whatever you call it) in my 6+ years of experience. I think a good PM should worth the salary of one dev + one business side, and probably more if applicable.\n Sometimes I wonder why it is so difficult to grow one good PM. I suspect it has something to do with how corporations grow. In the beginning there is usually no middle man, and devs directly talk to the business. This is fine when it is still small -- but then business grows and experienced devs/business either leave or just care about their own stuffs. Then corp realizes that it needs some middle men -- but they rarely hire devs/businesses from the rank, instead hiring from externals -- those people might be good PM in their previous companies, but they are sort of useless in the new environment because each one has its own communication \"flavors\". Then it needs another 2-3 years to grow those PMs, but how can they learn effectively if they neither go through business nor dev? It's going to take much longer to learn the rope -- and that's why we see so many echo chambers instead -- it's not their fault, because they are not experienced in this specific environment, what else can they do?\n That leaves my conclusion that a company should always hire PM from experienced internal business or devs instead, and PM should be a senior position -- there should be no \"junior\" PM positions.

If another publish attempt occurs, I will read !published again and try to publish when I shouldn't.\n I could update the published column before the publish has occurred, but 1) this is an anti pattern since the publish hasn't occurred yet and 2) if the db update succeeds but the publish fails, I'll again have a column that is inaccurate.\n I suppose in this particular circumstance I could just roll back the db update - but that could also fail.\n If this happens 25,000 times in one day, I need to know which ones are inaccurate etc.\n Are there more sophisticated/elegant ways for handling this sort of problem?\n Edit:\n Thanks everyone for all the feedback. I guess I should add: there is UI involvement here where we want to allow the user to take the action that causes the publish only once. We want to disallow taking that action on the UI more than once. We also want to enforce the constraint in the backend. IMO it is bad design to let the user believe they can take action when they can't.

As such, the work I do is often glueing their SaaS products together in some way or building small internal tools for my stakeholders.

We commit to repos that are contributed to by multiple teams and basically use a simplified version of Gitflow with feature branches merging into master only when fully reviewed & tested and considered prod ready. Once merged to master the change is released to prod. \n From time to time we do pair programming but tend to only do it when it's crunch time where necessary. The new process basically wants this full time. Devs have trialed this and feel burned out doing the pair programming all day everyday. \n Basically I ran my team on the idea of trunk based development and they're heavily against it including the senior devs (one of whom called it 'madness'). \n The main issue from their perspective is they consider it risky and few others don't think it will actually improve anything. I'm not entirely clued up on where manual QA testing fits into the process either but what I've read suggests this takes place after merge to master & even release which is a big concern for the team. Devs know that manual QA's capture important bugs via non-happy paths despite having a lot of automated tests and 100% code coverage. We already use feature flags for our projects so that we only expose this to clients when ready but devs know this isn't full proof.\n We've spoken about perhaps trialing this with older non-critical apps (which didn't get much buy in) and changes are rarely needed on these apps so I don't see us actually being able to do this any time soon whereas the CTO (and leadership below) is very keen for all teams to take this all on by this summer.\n    submitted by    /u/rjm101  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also, I rounded the figures to the nearest 1K.\n TrueUp.io\n  \nThere are 211K open tech jobs today; there were 163K at the March 3, 2023 low. That said, the peak was 478K in April '22\n In 2023, there were 429K people laid off by 2,001 tech companies (an average of 1,175 people/day)\n So far in 2014, there have been 118K people laid off by 540 tech companies (an average of 891 people/day)\n  \nLayoffs.fyi\n  \nIn 2023, there were 263K people laid off by 1,191 tech companies (an average of 721 people/day)\n So far in 2014, there have been 81K people laid off by 287 tech companies (an average of 619 people/day)\n  \nIf it doesn't feel like it's improving, hang in there.

          "description": "Hi.\n I'm looking at the following scenario: A (enterprise) team went the microservices route. Unfortunately there is zero data locality, everything is layered horizontally (persistence service, entity A logic service, entity B logic service, etc) and everything depends on everything else. Services keep each in other sync via synchronous RPC over network. In short, it's a distributed monolith.\n The project has progressed too far to make major architecture changes, and we need to move fast.\n We will soon have the foreseeable issue that keeping state synchronized across multiple distributed services and databases is hard. I shudder to think how the current system would behave during outages, and the many inconsistent states it will get in. I fear that if we don't intervene now, it will turn into a maintenance nightmare on release.\n If you've been in a similar situation, which eventual consistency pattern did you go with, and what was your experience? My main concern is keeping implementation overhead as low as possible. I've thought about the usual at-least-once event-driven + idempotency route, but I'm worried about the overhead during day-to-day development, and amount of changes required to even get started with that. Maybe try 2 phase commits instead?\n If you've been in a similar situation of trying to work with a distributed monolith, I'd be curious to hear what you went with, and what your experience was.\n    submitted by    /u/LizCDR  \n [link]   [comments]",

According to my manager, because of some of the work that we have coming up in the near future 1. that senior role that I mentioned got bumped to lead (we already have a lead) and 2. they made a pitch for me but ultimate was denied by my skip because there's a \"local\" candidate in the pipeline.\n All things considered I'm taking it in stride. I wasn't expecting to be promoted this soon anyway and this unfortunately lines up with the company direction of moving to more in-office / hybrid. There are a bunch of people that were hired (and still are) remote - seniors / leads / principals / managers / directors - one of whom is my manager. Most people still don't go into the office except on rare occasions like vertical get togethers where remote folks fly in too.\n I really enjoy working for the company that I do, so the game plan for now is just to keep kicking butt and make myself undeniable for promo. Looking elsewhere for a lead / staff job has crossed my mind, but I have an agreement with myself that I'll wait until 5 years before doing that (currently sitting at 3 and some change at my current level).

Our senior developers would now work as architects, product owners and team leads. Most of our great developers decided to jump the ship. I decided to stick around.\n 2018-2020 is a disaster. Everything falls apart. Its so bad that there is a new decision to switch back to 100% inhouse development.\n 2021, its hard to recruit great developers and we need to recruit a lot of people. Management and HR is not happy with the progress, too many candidates fail the technical interviews, its taking too long to sign new employees. It is decided that there will be no technical interviews from now on, HR will handle 100% of the recruitment process. Focus on \"soft values and skills\".\n 2022, it is still a disaster. We have signed a lot of new emoloyees, most with wrong skillsets due to HR having no clue about what we need. We needed senior software developers and we got database admins, sysadmins, service desk agents etc that wanted to get into software development. \n 2024, we are still in a very bad state, and guess what? The solution is to move development to India again. The history repeats. \n I should obviously jump the ship, i used to be a developer, now i just spend my time in crisis meetings, escalations, red alerts, meetings with management etc. However i find this mess to be very entertaining.

This story is running way over the allotted hours and I am super embarrassed right now.\n Is \"we should make our applications easier to ****ing test\" a thing you can agitate for?

Is it a design principle that good devs care about, and if so does it have a name and is there any literature on this?\n Maybe this is a junior-level question and I should've figured out a generalizable approach years ago.

The project has become a deviant and a one-off where they didn’t follow any of the patterns we used on any of the other services. Basically you tell them, we need to do C and to get there we need to build A and B. He then goes and builds E, F, G, H and then finally C. You tell him that that’s not how we usually do things, and then they asks you to write the requirements for it, and they will make sure that C matches those requirements… I don’t think anyone else on the team would be able to contribute to this project or support it, which is almost like a legacy service being brand new.\n They don’t get involved in any of the other tasks the rest of the team does, but constantly requires time from everyone to review their PRs. They also started getting very involved with other teams organizing lunch and learns, presentations, discussions and trying to get buy-in from other teams in how they do things.\n This individual is a very smart person and I don’t doubt his technical skills.. but is really a pain to work with him.

Little did I know, they were about to announce a funding round, invalidating the previous strike price and the strike price that I would receive has tripled (which I have not yet been granted). Sure I still get X # options however they are now at 3x the strike price. This means that instead of paying say $200k to exercise my options I have to pay $600k if I ever want to exercise (with the risk that it becomes potentially be worthless if it never IPOs).\n Given that I don't see the company realistically going IPO until at least 5+ years, this means if I leave before then I will have to either shell out a large amount of money or just leave my stake on the table. If I just leave it on the table then it only makes financial sense for me to stay at the company the amount of time equal to the amount of options I am willing to exercise.\n Has anyone else joined in the middle of a raise unknowingly and are there other solutions?

Historically i've not been into developer communities or open source contributions (earlier in career due to lack of awareness and now due all sorts of stuff including lack of motivation to do this outside work hours). I'm trying to change this a bit recently by getting more involved in communities in my company.\n Having said that within my teams i've always got good remarks, hikes and considered as a solid all-round senior. Pay was always good and I mostly enjoyed my work (was almost too grateful to even be hired as a SWE at the start). I also keep myself quite updated even though most of that knowledge stays mostly theoretical.\n As I evaluate my career i wonder if I should have seeked out more challenging work? There seems to be an expectation that after all these years one would have atleast tackled some hard technical challenge and I cant seem to think of any. Slowly starting to feel if i'm actually good to even handle anything challenging now and that's not helping my confidence to even look for such opportunities. What if I get an opportunity and fail?\n Just wondering if others have gone through such a phase and found their peace somehow? Or any advice on how to position myself for the next 15 years of my career? \n    submitted by    /u/rchan88  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Maybe a better thing to ask would be: how do you ensure you’re recognized for the products of your work?\n I’ve had a strange problem for a while now: despite putting in the same hours as my coworkers, and being very productive in terms of tickets, I have for years now been receiving the feedback that I should work with more urgency, and should try to get things done faster. I genuinely do not slack off at all, but the fact that I keep receiving this feedback (and that it has followed me between companies) indicates to me that I’m clearly at least doing a poor job of representing myself.\n For example: once, after a particularly rough sprint a manager had a version of this conversation with me, and we pulled up metrics, and over the course of that sprint I’d completed more tickets than anyone else on the team, and had completed the same number of “urgent” tickets as the rest of the team combined. (And it’s not as though I just pick easy tickets to pump my numbers)\n In one-off situations like that it’s easy to be like, look, I’m sorry I’m giving off this appearance, but if we look at the actual work that got done I think it’s clear I’m pulling my weight… but it’s really not a conversation I enjoy having over and over. Instead I’d really like to just not give off that appearance in the first place.\n    submitted by    /u/aahOhNoNotTheBees  \n [link]   [comments]",

I explained to him that we didn't have requirements for that and because of differences in the implementation, they wouldn't really work for this customer.\n On Friday he emailed the customer and asked them if they were planning on flowing us new requirements for the features that we discussed because it would make the tool much better. He didn't copy me, but the customer emailed back, copying me, and said they were considering it. I replied that we could discuss it, but gave the reasons why it wouldn't be a good idea for them.\n They also copied our management and our director came and yelled at me for \"requirements fishing\" - someone at the customer felt we were trying to increase the scope to inflate the contract value. To be honest, my reply wasn't the best (I didn't think it through enough and I can see why they might have thought we were coordinating)\n I'm pissed, if I were management, I'd fire him.

          "description": "I've been living in a VHCOL city on the west coast for the past few years, working as a software engineer. My company has an office out here, but announced recently they're closing it at the end of the month, after which I'll be fully remote.\n I don't particularly care for the city I live in, and thought that remote work would be a great opportunity to move to a larger city with more energy, namely NYC. I've been floating this idea around my team since the announcement of the closure was made, and haven't gotten any negative feedback around it, so I felt pretty confident about the topic when I officially asked my boss if I could move to NYC after I become fully remote.\n He got back to me a few days later (after speaking with HR), and said that a move is totally doable, if I take a $50k pay cut in my TC. I was pretty floored at this request, especially since by any metric NYC is more expensive than where I currently live, but the rationale is that the pay bands in NYC are ostensibly lower for my job compared to my current city.\n I'm wondering, is this level of pay cut common for a move from the west coast to NYC? It seems totally unreasonable to me, especially after looking at jobs at some of the other tech companies operating out of NYC. Many of these companies actually explicitly state that their pay bands are identical for NYC and the city I live in currently. Does anyone has experience with this kind of move?\n    submitted by    /u/mamossa  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I heard this metaphor a long time ago. I forget where and from whom. I also forget exactly how it went, but the basic idea was this. Developers are going to want to build their sandcastles. And the idea I think it was trying to express was the desire of software developerss to build the most complete, robust, and elegant solutions they could engineer for the problems they are trying to solve.\n Sometimes this may be good, but the context I think I remember the metaphor in was that of, \"project managers are necessary otherwise develops will never make progress towards a end goal, with endless scope creep and analysis paralysis\". Thinking about it now, I think this metaphor was being used in reference to the video game industry when I heard it.\n This post is two part, firstly, and mostly for my curiosity, I was hoping you all who are familiar with this expression could remind me exactly how it goes and provide your take on it.\n Secondly, I would like to start a discussion on the topic. At work, I don't really seem to face this issue that often. But when working on a personal project, I seem to almost never get very far because I get stuck in this trance where I am trying to over engineer the first problems I come across with any amount of complexity. For example, I have tried writing a vulkan renderer multiple times now, and each time I get stuck on trying to build a thesis on device and queue selection, coding for every use case that I can imagine, when in reality I only need one or two simple methods for accomplishing this task.

          "description": "Apart from using an actual debugger - in some cases you can’t have a debugger attached to the process, or the behavior you’re facing is complex and emergent, and you cannot just put a breakpoint or log statement there. If attaching a debugger is possible, then of course I just attach a debugger.\n Let me share mines:\n  \nIsolate - if something’s tricky, try to have the simplest isolated reproduction that you can have. This cuts out unnecessary complexity and usually also speeds up iterations.\n Isolate early - it’s tempting to think that “I just need to fix this here, redeploy and it’ll probably work”, but I found that more often than not, I should have isolated the case earlier. It’s balancing between the likelihood of fixing it in place in a couple of iterations with a longer cycle and between investing time upfront in the isolation to have shorter feedback cycle. Also, the skill of efficiently isolating cases is something that improves with practice.\n “Approach from two ends” - I’m not sure if this has a name, sometimes it can be called ‘binary search’. When I tried everything that I could think of but it all doesn’t seem to make any sense, then I step back and try to ‘brute force’ it. This usually starts by taking my problematic case on one end, and a known working example of what I’m trying to achieve on the other end. Then I start modifying on both ends: stripping down parts on the first end, and adding more and more parts on the other end, so that they become more and more similar. At some point, the difference that I didn’t think of pops out. A similar approach also works for example if a new release of an app has a regression, but it’s not clear from the code change why - then we can start producing synthetic approximation releases in a test environment to see where exactly things break. I really like this approach, it really helped me solve cases where I had no idea why things don’t work.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/my_dev_acc  \n [link]   [comments]",

Steam allows a separate developer and publisher credit on each game so you can have it link to your personal page too. \n I noticed when I want to follow a dev and I click their name it leads me to the publisher instead, which could be filled with random games and you get spammed whenever they announce a new one (some publishers are content farms, especially in the adult section) \n If a player is interested in YOU they might want to follow YOU but can't. You are leaving money on the table and on the publisher's hands because:\n  \nThose followers get an email whenever you publish a game and you might want to do another game in the future.\n You can funnel them into other social media.\n In case you part ways with the publisher.\n  \nIf you don't work with a publisher you should get a creator page still, because if you don't, Steam will only list your games without a following or featuring option. \n If you are or plan to go on Steam make sure you create it since day one.

Is there a certain stage of development where it makes sense to start releasing footage of it for marketing purposes? Is it paranoid to be afraid of one's idea getting stolen? Please share any thoughts on this subject.\n I have been developing a game full-time for almost a year by myself. The game is an idea that I have had for a while and that I believe to be both original and eye-catching. I myself enjoy playing what I have created so far, and friends and family that have played have also had the reaction that I was hoping for.\n As of now I have been keeping my game very close to the chest. But I am currently considering looking for investments in my game and then I would obviously have to share everything about it. I am not super scared that a potential investor would steal it, since I would try to only approach serious actors but if you have any thoughts on this please share them.\n Edit:\n Thank you all for your input! But all I see is a bunch of people trying to convince me to share my idea so they can steal it.. /s No, but for real, I really appreciate all your views and I hear what many of you are saying about the importance of exposure and the low likelihood that anyone will put in the effort to steal something that has not yet been proven. I will rethink my approach and will share my game sooner than I intended. But first I want to have a few more features in place and some minimal polishing as well.

          "description": "I've been working on my game for around 2-3 years. There were times when I was anxious about negative feedback and the lack of wishlists. But 2 days ago, I launched my game. Here's what I'm feeling right now.\n Firstly, I feel relaxed and calm. I'm also missing the sense of \"I have work to do\", which was a huge part of my life every day for the last few years. All that tension is gone. I feel empty, but in a good way. I'm still getting used to the feeling of having nothing to do.\n Yesterday, a few hours after launch, I went out and met some friends and had a good time. I didn't think about my game at all (which was weird to be honest). Today, I cleared out some old junk in my \"studio\". I also wiped clean the white board I used to write my daily to-do lists. It's blank for the first time in many years. That's exactly how I am feeling.\n I know there's still work to do with regard to promotions and fixing game issues as and when they come up. But I know for a fact that the actual mountain of gamedev work has been conquered. This feeling of knowing I've reached my goal is incredible. Guys, I'm not saying it's a high, but it's a high. Not an intense high. But a high nonetheless.\n IMO completing my game and releasing it is the conclusion of my game dev journey, or at least the first of many journeys. Although, the sales have been so-so thus far (don't ask about it), it does feel immensely rewarding to just know that my creation is out there, and that people are playing it! \n Regardless of what happens, I know my future self will look back on these post-launch moments fondly. I think whatever I'm feeling makes the struggle worth it. I also know that if there existed a club for indie devs who have completed and published a game, I'm officially in it.\n Anyway, if you're a new solo indie game developer reading this, trust me when I say that completing an indie game and publishing it is an awesome feeling. In fact, it's a huge achievement in and of itself.\n    submitted by    /u/cs_ptroid  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I cannot afford to spend more effort on this game, and I've moved on to other projects.\n Today, a fan asked on the Steam forum if they can expect new stories and game events. I'm not sure how to express that, due to the poor sales, I am unable to provide support beyond bug fixes.

For context I use UE5 for all my projects; have a 4090 RTX, super high quality monitors, and 16GB ram. As soon as I start adding foliage to a large, somewhat open world, my FPS slows down like crazy. To the point that I have to choose trees over grass sometimes as an example. I use LODs, low draw distance, but it doesn’t seem to help. I don’t know how a big company like Ubisoft can throw that much high quality foliage in their game alongside exceptional lighting without destroying the games performance?

But they are also not free games, so if you have a group of, say, 2-3 people you might want to play with, that means you have to get 3 copies... Which now makes the total cost a AAA game. \n And, depending on who you play with, it might just be a fun few hours and never play it again. \n But we used to have couch play, so you wouldn't need to buy multiple copies of games, just get one and get your friends to your hause and call it a day. \n So, wouldn't a game that you could buy and get a few codes to give to your friends, but they can only play the game as long as you are playing the game increase sells? \n I'm talking from a place of ignorance and just from a place of \"wow, that game looks fun, but I can't sink 60 bucks to play it for a few hours\". It just seems that could fix that issue and the solution seems to be relatively simple. Get the game on steam, give friends code, friends can now only play if you are in a party with them. \n    submitted by    /u/Luised2094  \n [link]   [comments]",

It also includes a sort of prototype infinite scaling endgame for players who have gotten through all of the existing demo content. \n The demo focuses heavily on loot.

          "description": "And finally I got a demo on Steam.\n A little context\n About two years ago I decided to try making a game. It was decided to do a small, but not entirely microscopic project that would bring me satisfaction from its implementation.\n So, throughout these two years, as development progressed, I acquired and improved my skills in order to create something useful. I’m not sure that I expected to do everything much faster, I don’t even remember my initial plans and deadlines, but I already registered the game at 3 demo festivals and successfully canceled the registration, deciding that I could do better. And finally the demo appeared where I had long wanted to see it.\n What is the game about?\n “Defeat/beat people” was conceived as a mixture of tabletop warhammer (in terms of scale it turned out to be more of a kill team offshoot), Xcom and Battle brothers. Naturally, not the ultimate version, but what I can put together on my own, trying to isolate what I like about these games.\n In concept, this is a fairly simple turn-based tactics, without overload with numbers, with customization of units and quick battles that affect the balance of forces within the star system.\n Most of the game was made by me alone. My girlfriend helped with the music, and she has been putting up with this development with me from the very beginning. I was also helped by several people who tested the game and caught bugs when I was no longer physically able to sit at the computer.\n There is still a lot of work ahead. I hope to complete the full version of the game within a few months, but so far the actual development time has always been several times longer than planned.\n    submitted by    /u/reegamesglobal  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I did all the basics of math in school and I took an upgraded course before I could study comp. science at university.\n I was bad at it, and Math doesn't actually interest me. The sciences never did, so it's weird I've landed myself in Computer science, and truth be told, I'm not a particularly skilled programmer either. My field of interest lie in the aesthetics, the creative, and the collaboration of thinking of, and implementing games. I did just well enough in projects that I didn't feel discouraged from the entire field, and now I still want to be a contributor in game dev. That said, I feel like math or just my inattention to detail is a problem.\n During the higher education I encountered a few instances where I would tell someone \"Err, so I don't actually know how to write this\" and they'd say \"It's just phytagoras. I can't tell you what to do.\" and I had to figure something out on my own to make a cube move on the screen or something, and I ended up kinda not figuring it out, and I think eventually whoever said something about pythagoras did something on his own.\n And it's not like I don't know the pythagoras sentence, it's just that in practice I suck at math and barely know how to apply it. I remember some shit we drew on a blackboard but it doesn't come naturally to me to think mathematically.\n But now I'm facing specific needs like, I wanna figure out how to make an eye shader, cuz I have a 3D model where I'm dissatisfied with how glassy the eyes look. But people give me math stuff to figure it out. I'll be running in circles with some design I'm trying to code until some smart guy shows me some x = y2 + i > 0 ???? math that apparently solves it in one sentence.\n So I'm a bit agitated by my lack of appliccable knowledge. Do you find that Math is important to your average game work? And if I were to learn about how to develop my own shaders, is there some kind of book that could help me?\n    submitted by    /u/linkenski  \n [link]   [comments]",

I should probably just slap on a working title and go.\n I am reading advice that says \"Keep the game name short and not to use words a 7th grader cannot spell\", but the problem is essentially this:\n 1) Every freaking combination of common words are taken and potentially trademarked items (much like you can't get the web domain name you want)\n 2) Common words don't fare well as a search term.\n 3) Lots of successful games historically have featured a non-word or made up name.\n The title really makes or breaks the game in terms of mood or seriousness. Naming it something ambiguous like Nox Arcanum or Ultima sorta has the benefit that they don't really \"say\" anything about the game, and do not constrain the developer in terms of story or design.\n And of course I don't want to get sued if something is \"too close\" to something else.

The steam shop page exists for a few months, not resulting in many wishlists, which I would expect for a hobby project without marketing (except for a few YouTube shorts (~100-400 views each)).\n So the daily wishlists were around 0-1, mostly 0. Then, a few days ago, I checked the tags again, and compared them to the tags to \"The Escapists\", since the gameplay is pretty similar.\n Here is my little/big fuck-up: The tag I initially set with the highest priority is (in german) \"Ausbruchssimulation\", which can also be understood as a game where you/the player has to break out of somewhere. I was kinda wondering why \"The Escapists\" is not tagged with the same tag, as I would imagine it is the most fitting for this kind of game.\n I looked at the games that were tagged with \"Ausbruchssimulation\", saw stuff like Pague Inc. etc., and had an epiphany: changed the language to english, \"Ausbruchssimulation\" is the translation for \"Outbreak Sim\".\n Yeah, so i removed the tag and (at least for the four days since) this also had an impact on daily wishlists: https://ibb.co/GHgBXxh\n    submitted by    /u/projectbreakout  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can't keep going like this, hoping something is going to work out.\n I paid (finally in full) $150,000 for a Software Engineering degree from RIT that did not have 1 class explaining what a server was or teaching us web development (weirdly we had one class Enterprise Architecture class teaching patterns like Join tables with no context for how to write database queries).\n What's left of the industry has forced me out. I will never give up gamedev as a hobby, but I need a way to make money.

          "description": "Since I started making games, people around me are creating \"Game Ideas\" and asking me to implement them. Without any context. Without understanding market, game design and mechanics, scope and cost. It's especially irritating because mostly family and friends have that \"great ideas\" and I can't tell them to go away (usually).\n To anyone doing this and not understanding why gamedev usually don't pick up your ideas.\n Everyone have \"ideas\". I can literally from the top of my head in 1h give you 20 games ideas. 1 idea every 3 minutes. But ideas without full context, are not worth much. It's because every idea need days or weeks of actual work to create a design and validate if it's a good to make a game from it. With mechanics working together, with story, with scenario, with checking if similar games exist, with validating if mechanics are really working, if they are fun. And most of the time because of details in game design it will turn out \"the idea\" is not working. If you come to a gamedev with an \"idea\", understand that what really gamedev sees is not a solution, but a problem. You are basically asking someone to spend dozens of hours, maybe days or weeks to validate if \"the idea\" makes sense.\n If you want to cooperate with someone making games, make a full game design instead**.** Do the leg work. Prepare full concept. Check market. Play many games in genre of game from your \"idea\". Validate the concept as much as you can. Find assets. Learn what GDD is. If game is story driven - learn how to write. Write short stories first and check with audience your writing. Then write a story for your \"idea\". I mean - depending on the game type, spend at least 100-300h of work before you start talking to someone making games. Then be prepared to put another hundreds of hours of working closely with a gamedev.\n Ideas are cheap. 1 \"idea\" is created in 3 minutes.\n Full concepts are worth much more. But still the biggest cost is in making a game.\n    submitted by    /u/DevPot  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm actually not joking, If I had a time machine to 15 years ago, sigh\n Though if the hubris does overwhelm, pick an easier game genre, Something one person can do, no matter how brilliant you think you are, you really are not. Still it could of been worse I could of chosen a MMORPGGGGGH\n Don't make a major gameplay change midway (I done 2 on this game adventure, turn based -> realtime & dungeons -> Open World). Lesson learnt, If the game ain't happening, scrap it and start something new, don't try to shoehorn what you have into this cause it will bite you in the ass later \n Don't roll your own code. i.e re-invent the wheel, Sure this is oldhat advice. But take it from an oldfart, dont. I went from my own engine in c++/opengl & my own physics engine -> my engine + ODE -> Unity & C#. I wasn't cool rolling my own, I was just a dick wasting hours, hours that could of been useful realizing my dream \n  \nPositive advice:\n  \nOnly 2 rules in programming\n #1 KISS - Always keep it simple, you may think you're smart doing some shortcut or elegant solution, but 50% of the time you're creating problems down the track, why roll the dice, play it smart. OK this is a mantra but #2 is not well known\n #2 Treat everything as equal. AKA - don't make exceptions, no matter how much sense they appear to make, inevitably it will bite you in the ass later\n Now I still violate both the rules even now (after 40 years of programming) So this is do as I say, not as I do thing\n Don't be afraid to go out of your comfort zone. Myself, In the last couple of years, I've (with my GF) had my child, something I swear I would never do (It happened though) & gone to help in Ukraine.

I heard about your game from a friend and it seems perfect!\" and then link to a twitch profile that has been inactive for two years.\n I know that these are likely bots/scammers looking for free steam keys to resell. My game is 2 bucks though... \n    submitted by    /u/Snide_insinuations  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our plan was to launch a steam page soon because I heard somewhere way in the past that before you even pitch to publishers, you must provide proof that people are interested in your game.

I started following tutorials as well and at the time I was bad and wished someone had helped me sooner understand how to overcome the problem I was facing.\n I am trying to help as much as I can here but I see a lot of posts that could be easily done by just looking at the documentation and it would be easy for me to look down and just say something like \"but look here, your answer is written in plein sight\" but I know the doc is also a technical intimidating document that beginners don't use as much.\n All of that to ask : \"Would you as a beginner be interested to know how to use the Godot documentation ?\"\n    submitted by    /u/tfhfate  \n [link]   [comments]",

I must say, it's sadly not very populated.\n I'm not sure why as the UI and site layout is perfect for it's role, I'd really love to see it used more.\n Are people aware of this site? If so are you willing to donate shader code to it?\n I've seen 20-30 posts sharing shader code over the past 2 days and I feel it rather sad that that code will practically vanish once the posts are thrown to the bottom of the reddit post stack. A lot of them just don't get enough attention to show up in search result so for all intents and purposes they're gone.\n I'd like to urge players to post their shaders on the site - it really is a great archive and I feel it would add a lot more permanency to your contribution. As it stands, posting it to reddit you're limiting yourself (and others) to around a 48 hour window before the post becomes practically invisible to the general public.\n    submitted by    /u/Enough-Town3289  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi r/godot,\n I've been working on a project called GodotInGameBuildingSystem, aimed at helping developers easily integrate building mechanics into their Godot games. It’s straightforward, open-source, and I hope it can be useful to some of you!\n Features:\n  \nDynamic Building: Add robust building functions that allow players to construct and customize their environments.\n Customizable: Adjust it to suit your game’s unique style and needs.\n Written in C#: Currently available in C#, ensuring robust performance and integration.\n Open Source: Free to use and modify under the MIT License—contributions are welcome!\n  \nWhy consider it?\n It’s built specifically for Godot, making integration smooth, and it’s a great way to add interactive elements to your game. I’d love for you to try it out and share any feedback or suggestions!\n Future Plans:\n I am planning to develop a version in GDScript based on community interest. The sooner I see significant interest, the faster I'll work on releasing the GDScript version!\n 👉 See it on Asset Store\n Thanks for checking it out, and happy developing!\n https://preview.redd.it/zeuwv7ap0xzc1.png?width=1909&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7965ac479b01febc11ec936a41a26f9834f1b42\n https://preview.redd.it/0ejea6ap0xzc1.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf4bd2c92bcfbbbd5a25dcf673401113043b2e47\n https://preview.redd.it/zsz2b7ap0xzc1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=57c6a919e2442096810898033963b6f90b2c434f\n https://preview.redd.it/9kz3s6ap0xzc1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bb891adf24bbdab584384b6a7100f283cbc0f7b\n https://preview.redd.it/i0ye79ap0xzc1.png?width=1910&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9fd5bafb4e69be8bd3953b53a355f2aaa25a30f\n    submitted by    /u/MaliciusD  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Introduction\n repo\n This is a proof of concept/Prototype\n Almost a year ago, I started working on a GDScript compiler. And then stopped because getting GDExtensions to work (even in C) was a pain (because it's not documented). This was my first time using rust, so the code was kinda bad. \n I have revisited the project, but it's a bit different now. Instead of using LLVM to generate machine code, I generate rust, because if I can use rust I will (even for shaders). \n And with help of gdext, I won't have to deal with GDExtensions.\n Benchmarks\n The rust version (without optimizations) can run 5 times faster in this case nth Fibonacci number.\n  GDScript: 390 ms Rust: 77 ms \n (Code for the benchmark can be seen in addon/bench.gd)\n Features\n  \nFunction\n Calling functions in the same file\n Math\n for loops\n while loops\n if\n variables\n Addon\n maybe I missed something else\n  \nLimitations\n  \nUsing other Nodes.\n calling function outside the file\n Can generate wrong rust code\n And a lot more\n  \nFAQ\n Why rust?\n I like it.\n Will this make normal GDScript obsolete?\n No, GDScript is really nice to debug. And fast to iterate.\n Why is GDScript slow?\n IMO, I think the main problem is loops, it's something that any interpreted language fears.\n Why not make a JIT?\n While it will be better for dynamically typed language like GDScript, but it will be harder to implement. Oh, and JIT's won't work on IOS.\n Why not use rust or c++ direly\n Debug in Godot, run with rust. GDScript is easy to debug for normal people, for compiled languages you need to use lldb or gdb.\n Future\n  \nbeg Godot devs for --script-dump-ast\n Better codegen (this that takes AST and makes rust source code)\n Improve the add-on.\n  \nI won't be working on this for some time. Writing a parser is only fun the first time, not 2 times + other failed attempts with parser generators. Basically, nothing will be done until --script-dump-ast, and then maybe I will continue.\n Maybe this will revive this issue.\n    submitted by    /u/ssd-guy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Godot 4.2 will still default to 6.0, but you can edit your .csproj file to change this.\n \nBelieve it or not, you can use full native AOT compilation with C# in Godot projects. That's right: no more virtual machine IL interpreting JIT nonsense. Real machine code. Interpreted languages require too much imagination.\n \n Set it up like below, and you can completely ditch the CLR runtime and its dependencies for your game and get considerable performance gains.

They knew full well that they didn't meet the system requirements, but wanted to try it anyway. Turned out the game ran pretty awfully on Proton because of their hardware, the framerate skipped wildly around, their progress kept getting wiped out, and certain textures either didn't load or popped in after several minutes.\n I had put off building for Linux until I could boot it up myself on an old PC, so I spent the day trying to debug the issue with them and figure out if there were certain settings that could improve their experience.\n In the end, we couldn't find any fixes. So I took a leap of faith, put all my chips on Godot and just blindly built a Linux version for them without testing it, figuring it probably wouldn't work but was worth a shot.\n It worked PERFECTLY, first try, no issues.\n Love this engine, love you guys. Shown above is me and the new player absolutely dumbfounded by Godot effortlessly taking care of business.\n    submitted by    /u/AuraTummyache  \n [link]   [comments]",

So mods, if you delete this post, I would appreciate anyone letting me know a more appropriate place to post this.\n For background: I initially learned Java 8 years ago and it got me hooked on computer science. I've gone down a traditional path for the most part as I now do back-end IT work focused on cloud migration, though have done a number of ad hoc projects that go beyond that and worked in a more data-analyst-esque position before I ended up in this job 8 months ago. I have professional experience in Python, R, SQL (Redshift, SQL Server, MySQL, and MS Access for whatever that might count for...), VBA, and some familiarity with bash and PowerShell to the extent that I could use the internet to help me automate some recurring processes.\n I discovered ethical hacking recently and I think it's something I want to pursue. But, if I'm being honest, learning this feels pretty daunting and I'm not really sure where to begin (I've got a Linux VM booted up at the very least). \n More or less, I'm looking for someone with experience that I can learn from and get support from. If anyone is interested and wants to chat, I'd be more than happy to compensate with my own hourly wage if it becomes long-term (my hope) .\n Really, I'm just looking for quality resources for a complete beginner because, while I can code, I'm definitely lacking in the knowledge required here.\n    submitted by    /u/BeanPaddle  \n [link]   [comments]",

The issue is, this is the 3rd gen Alex echo show 5 which runs their custom OS instead of Android like their old ones. I've been searching online but haven't seen anything and most people said that there isn't a fastboot menu in this thing. After playing around with it though, I found this! Done by pressing all 3 buttons on startup. However, I couldn't find anything else from here. I'm not nearly proficient enough in programming and stuff to port android or Linux on this thing so I was hoping to at least get the information out there that there is a fastboot menu on these newer Alexa devices (I literally found nothing on the newer gen devices) \n    submitted by    /u/Hofnik121  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instructions on how to use the Windows API. Reverse Engineering existing malwares (you can do the same for linux too). Hiding shellcodes from EDRs. Process injection. Loading share libraries. Etc. \n I'm pretty sure developing malware for linux is not much harder than windows. So, why people barely talk about it compared to windows?\n ​\n Is this because of windows dominating the marketshare being the prime target for malware developers?

I'd like to put Linux on it and I managed to install OS swapping the HD on another machine, problem is I really want to get rid of that password for future updates. Now I know I can probably buy an unprotected eeprom chip ans swap it but I'm not this good at soldering and I'd prefer to explore software solutions. \n HP has a command line tool (part of its client management tool set) called bios configurator utility. My understanding is that it requires the old password to replace it with a new one and it may accept plain text options for both (although I'm not sure if it only accept hashed versions in bin files at least for the old one. My questions are - may a bruteforce approach be viable? What would you suggest me to use first (e.g. Dictionary, rainbow tables...)in a hypotetical powershell script to cycle through, considering that I'm not a skilled programmer and it would be run on a slow machine? - are there other no-solder approaches I should also consider? Like, can I dump the eeprom chip and try to decode the password from there? \n Other things I tried: CMOS battery is not an option: it ran out but password is still there and if I input the wrong passwords I don't get to read the code that can be used for retrieving hard-coded backdoors\n    submitted by    /u/Jarngreipr9  \n [link]   [comments]",

As I'm continuing my journey on this website, I'm finding that I'm forgetting some things. I'll know the general idea, but not the exact bits of information I'd need in the moment.\n I know the default answer to this is just study, but even if I strap myself to a chair and pin my eyelids open like I'm in Clockwork Orange, I still struggle to remember stuff. I learn best by doing and repetition of the doing, but I'm not sure what I can use aside from THM and Hack the Box. I'm still not at a point to be doing an CTF challenges (as far as I know), so those aren't really an option.\n What I want to know, is what do you guys use in conjunction with these? I looked at the wiki, and I plan on trying some of them out, but I worry that they're going to be too dense/technical for me. Are there any other resources to help familiarize yourself with hacking concepts/tools? Key word being \"familiarize\". I've done the lessons, but need reminders before I can fully commit it to memory.\n EDIT: I should mention that I do takes notes as I go through the lessons, and it does help, but it doesn't help me full grasp these concepts when it's just simple tidbits of information\n    submitted by    /u/MakeMoreFae  \n [link]   [comments]",

Can the same exploit be executed if the vulnerable c program runs on a different machine? Will memory addresses be the same?\n I think the answer is no they probably won´t even be the same when running only in the same environment and on the same machine. There is nothing like a guarantee that it will have the same address.\n A modern-day OS assigns the memory arbitrarily (within certain sections of course). This technique is called Address Space Layout Randomization. Also gcc or clang uses the --fstack-protector that prevents buffer overflow attacks\n Hence, my final question confuses me and make no sense for me based on this video is how geohot manage to exploit a buffer overflow attack remotely if addresses would not the same.

I decided to take a look and used tcpdump -r <filename> and saw the names of devices from my own local network specifically my printer. I wasn't using wifite on my own network and never used reader. This seems very odd to me. It was placed in my home directory. Where I put other caps when running wifite. I checked the birth date of the file and it was created exactly when i was using wifite. \n Has any one experienced this or could tell me why packets from my own local network were captured and then the file titled after a program I wasn't using? \n    submitted by    /u/Junior-Bear-6955  \n [link]   [comments]",

Im using a Brostrend A1 network adapter.\n I've put it into monitor mode successfully with 'airmon-ng check kill' + 'airmon-ng start wlan0'. I can run 'airodump-ng wlan0' (my adapter doesn't change to wlan0mon, for some reason, despite an iwconfig showing it in monitor mode). I'm able to catch all kinds of aps and clients, bssid's. \n Okay so I captured my target bssid, I then ran airodump again to find my target clients. I'm pretty sure my phone is hiding it's Mac address, because it doesn't show up under 2.4 or 5ghz packet capture. But despite that I'm sitting with my whole family and no ones showing as being kicked off when I run aireplay-ng. When I run this I've tried deauth against just the full AP, but I've also tried several device Mac addresses that are showing up. It actually runs the deauth successfully. I'm seeing ack results. But yeah despite trying maybe 5 or 6 times on different networks and devices. It'll run, but it won't kick anyone off. \n Any ideas?

I didn't particularly like it, so it's not sad in that sense; however, the financial implications are obviously less than ideal.\n I've been interested in cybersecurity for a long time and even took the CompTIA Security+ certification a few years ago just for fun, but that is the extent of my relevant experience. I want to use this as an opportunity to upskill myself and finally break into a field that I am genuinely passionate about, and I do not mind starting from the bottom. I have enough saved that I can go at this full time, 8-10 hours a day, for the next 4 months. Importantly, I have basically no other commitments.\n I have outlined a plan:\n  \n Month 1: TryHackMe + HTB boxes with walkthrough to get the basics down and document all progress. \n Month 2: Study for and take the PNPT (can't afford the OSCP), continue with HTB and THM. \n Month 3: Renew Security+ cert and start applying for tons of jobs, keep going at it with HTB and THM. \n Month 4: Keep applying, and hopefully get some interviews, and keep doing the same stuff and document all progress. And if I get no results maybe try my luck in Bug Bounty hunting.\n  \nI know this is a massive undertaking, and I realize it's going to be a tough few months. But I've always seemed to learn quickly, and I'm very committed to making this happen.\n I would greatly appreciate any feedback, critique, and advice that could help me in my journey.\n    submitted by    /u/DimWit666  \n [link]   [comments]",

Go through the documentation, browse Stack Overflow, and struggle to build your project. It's okay to write subpar code in the beginning. Build the project first, then fix and optimize the code later. This process will help you become a better engineer.\n Expert engineers, what are your thoughts on this advice? Is it good?

I ran into an issue where my code was producing unexpected results, but not crashing.\n I considered adding print() statements in my code, but I thought it would be hard to toggle all of them on and off using individual comments. Then I thought I might use a Boolean variable, and if that variable was True, it would allow all the print() functions to fire. But this adds a lot of lines of code to a project, 1 line for the if statement and then another line for the print. So that's 2 lines every time I want to check, and if I have 50 things I want to check that's 100 extra lines of code.\n I don't know what this is called but I feel like being able to print out the precise steps a program is executing is important information and I haven't seen it discussed in the book yet. \n My IDE is Notepad++. I am specifically using Notepad++ because it doesn't have any autocomplete and it forces me to type everything out by hand--but I'm wondering if another IDE might have something that allows this print() debugging thing to be easier for me.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/glide_bro  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am pretty new to coding, and have been doing two courses these last two or three months and am now doing projecta from Big Book Small Python Projects. I am having a LOT of fun, and learning a lot I didn’t know I could do. \n Anyways, I am struggling with shite memory sometimes and just wanted some input on what level of ”forgetfulness” is ”normal” and if you feel it has improved with practice. \n When I write a project that is a bit longer (for me that is maybe 200+ lines) I always make extensive docstrings, doctests/examples of use and write comments next to most expressions. I might be doing this too much, but if I don’t I just forget how the expression or loop or whatever works. \n I often look at something the next day and think (why the hell does it say (x + y + 1) here? Is it the index position or why did I need that +1 again. Or for example, ”what data type was this variable now”? (Well maybe not the last one but it is just an example) If I am working on something during friday I will keep working one or two hours during the weekend too or come monday I am so out of the mindset I just have to basically relearn my code.\n I am not really looking for a guide on when and how to comment your code, I could google that (but it is still welcome if anyone feels like sharing their process) but more input on what level of forgeting the project and how the code works is normal, and how you have developed this ability over time or if you rely almost entirely on comments. \n What do you think about this? \n Edit: the use of x + y is just an example.

I thought I was too dumb to do anything; started too late, blah blah blah. The satisfication I feel from 200 lines of WET code that I can now reformat into something polished is awesome.\n Now I'm looking forward to submitting my final project and moving onto another language (probably via CS50x) to continue learning.

Do other people use \"templates\" like this? \n If I want to do something ambitious I quickly get overwhelmed just figuring out all the unknown unknowns. I guess experience will help with that, but what resources do experienced people turn to? Documentation? How do you find what you need without reading everything?

I got about 30 minutes into C++ but from the little that i worked on ren'py, i liked python more.\n So it leads back to my topic title, is there are place that teaches Python for free or at least 1 time payment. I want to take it at my own pace and fear subscription services.\n edit: saw another thread where this guy posted this link for python courses. $20 for learning python in 60 days. I'm seeing people say udemy is good. Would you guys recommend? a coupon code seems to be attached with the link already too. https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/?couponCode=LEADERSALE24B\n I did try YT and search for people teaching python, but there's so many people doing it, is there one specific channel / guide you guys would recommend if not taking an online course?\n EDIT AGAIN: So after spending a few hours trying out Python vs GDScript. I'm going to be going with GD script. I'm loving how it works just slightly better then Python, but both are good. What won me over was that I had already planned on using Gadot as the first game engine i would try. So it only made sense to use the language that is native to that engine.

I’m currently a high-school student taking a Computer Science course in school, mainly focusing on Python. \n I have absolutely no background in coding but I had the “dream” of becoming a programmer, so I took the course. \n I’ve always heard people around me say stuff like “if you’re good at math, you’ll be fine with coding” “You’ll probably like coding since you like math”. It encouraged me to learn how to program but I’m starting to realize now that I absolutely hate programming. My eyes hurt staring at the computer screen for so long, the environment I code in, the lack of support, the amount of errors, plenty of room for mistakes, and it’s just not fun. \n To be honest..I think the money is what I saw of becoming a programmer. Hence I forced myself to code and lied to myself that I enjoy this. \n I like problem-solving in math and looking for errors in my solution when my answer is wrong, but with programming…it’s just not the same—at least for me. \n Am I just not smart enough for programming? I’m starting to doubt my math skills and critical thinking abilities. I feel so stupid when coding.\n Edit; sorry if this sounds like a rant.

I recently returned from the war, in which I participated for more than 2 years (I am an officer of the Armed Forces of Ukraine), and it so happened that I decided to change my profession. I have always been interested in IT and technology, how everything works \"under the hood\". Now I'm studying the Python programming language, everything seems to be okay, I understand how it works, what is involved and the specifics, but when it comes to performing some independent task, I just get stuck. It doesn't seem like a very difficult task, but I can sit for days and think about how to do it, and eventually I start doing a lot of googling and using artificial intelligence to solve it, and everything works out. But there is no such thing as me realizing how to do it better on my own. Although other people in my study group do it much faster than me, so I sometimes lose motivation, but I keep doing it. And I feel stupid all the time. Maybe I'm not studying very effectively, what would you advise me to do in such a situation?

As part of their coursework, they need to create a small web app using real-world data from APIs.\n While searching for reliable and relevant APIs, I stumbled upon the famous Public API List on GitHub. While checking out the list, I found that many of the APIs are no longer free, no longer public or have been discontinued.\n To address the problem of outdated APIs, I created a small website called freepublicapis.com, which contains my collection of APIs and tests all endpoints every four hours. The site logs responses and measures metrics such as response time and error rate. Currently, there are 28 APIs available, many of which are from Swiss public institutions.\n If you know any cool APIs from your city or country, that helped you learn programming, it would be fantastic if you could contribute them to the website. Your participation could make this website relevant to students learning web development around the world.\n    submitted by    /u/Gotopik  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I often think about this one time when I was installing Linux as a dual boot on my new computer. The installation would go smooth, but after logging in I couldn't for the life of me get anything to show up. For example I was able to fire up a terminal, execute commands perfectly fine, no errors at all. But starting some applications wouldn't work, they would show up in htop but I couldn't see them. I spent a day debugging this and installed ~5 different distros but still found no solution.\n Being done I got up from my computer, turned on my TV and saw my desktop on the TV. The computer was connected to the TV via HDMI and would make it a primary display despite it being turned off... Having 5 years of experience with Linux I started exploring drivers, looking into logs etc. and it didn't occur to me to check the connected displays.\n Do you have any stories with Linux where you turned out to be a complete idiot when in reality the solution was as simple as unplugging a cable?\n    submitted by    /u/Mrkaniclol  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Here's what I believe Microsoft (and partners) have in store for the future: they are going all-in on pulling an Apple-style switch to ARM on the PC hardware market. This move has several concomitant side-effects:\n  \nMaking AI a mandatory feature on the PC, with all the juicy free data they will be able to harvest from it. Requiring an NPU (i.e. an AI-capable chip) as a standard on all future PCs.\n Herding all the PC Gamer market onto the XBOX (which will still be Intel/AMD based) and possibly onto other upcoming compatible consoles (there's been talk of allowing Steam and Epic marketplaces on the XBOX platform, which would be HUGE... also, a Steam console, anyone?) It's possible that the x86_64 architecture will remain in wide use as gaming hardware.\n (Possibly) Locking down the ability of booting Linux or any other OS on such ARM hardware. This should be contested with all the Anti-Trust legal recourse available everywhere. (EDIT: disproved here)\n Setting back the advance of the Linux marketshare at least for a while. \n  \nThis last point is the one I would emphasize the most: currently, Linux on ARM seems to be kind of an afterthought among developers, and most distributions have builds targeted at the Raspberry Pi and such small platforms. To my knowledge, only RHEL (and its community clones) offer an ARM build with full desktop capabilities, but these seem to be targeted at servers.\n How long until the major Linux distributions catch up with the switch to ARM, and become ready to deliver the current level of software reliability onto the new PCs?\n Easy with the downvoting, people!\n I am presenting my concerns here, I believe these issues should be discussed. No point in burying the post if you don't fully agree with what I'm saying. I would appreciate your opinion and insight, thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Economy_Blueberry_25  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The current buzz is that Dell and others are coming up with bunch of ARM-powered laptops on the market soon. Yes, I am aware that there already are some on the market, but they might or might not be the next big thing. I wanted informed opinions to what extent this is a threat to the current non-professional use of Linux. As things currently stand, you can pretty much install Linux easily on anything you buy from e.g., BestBuy, and, even more importantly, you can install it on a device that you purchased before you even had any inkling that Linux would be something you'd use.\n Feel free to correct me, but here is as I understand the situation as a non-tech professional. Everything here with a caveat \"in the foreseeable future\".\n  \nIntel/AMD are not going to disappear, and it is uncertain to what extent ARM laptops will take over. There will be Linux certified devices for professionals regardless and, obviously, Linux compatible-hardware for, say, for server use.\n Linux has been running on ARM devices for a long time, so ARM itself is not the issue. My understanding is that that boot systems for ARM devices are less standardized and many current ARM devices need tailored solutions for this. And then there is the whole Apple M-series devices issue, with lots of non-standard hardware.\n  \nSince reddit/the internet is full of \"chicken little\" reactions to poorly understood/speculative tech news, I wanted to ask to what extent you think that the potential new wave of ARM Windows laptops is going to be:\n a) not a big deal, we will have Linux running on them easily in a newbie-friendly way very soon, or\n b) like the Apple M-series, where progress will be made, but you can hardly recommend Linux on those for newbies?\n Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/nongaussian  \n [link]   [comments]",

I slowly became disenchanted with the direction of development and the decisions being made, so I switched to Mint LMDE last year. Of course I heard of Arch, but had never tried it. This weekend I loaded Arch up into a KVM/Qemu VM and was blown away on how freaking fast and customizable it was with only the pittance of resources I gave the VM. Long story short, Arch is now the host.\n https://i.imgur.com/76D5C0G.png\n    submitted by    /u/Phr0stByte_01  \n [link]   [comments]",

So after some research I managed to get out from this situation. Since pacman and yay were unusable, I couldn't neither install packages locally, maybe importing them from another OS, so I found it difficult to get out.

I went ahead to install Plasma 6 alongside pipewire and ffmpeg, everything seemed to be going steadily, however I have run into a bit of a roadblock, as I've been trying to look up things about what's been going on, yet nothing has seemed to work. Let me explain.\n For every single application I have tested, (Web browser, the KDE sound test, Discord, basically all of the apps that I need to not have delayed audio, for the desktop to be smooth-sailing) and all of them weirdly showed the same problem. (Playing audio for the first time would show a ~0.4s delay before playing, and after pausing/having zero sound being played in the moment, would \"reset\" the timer and give me more delay.) Weirdly, this did not have an affect with the sync as you'd might expect, but that's made it significantly more difficult to find a solution to the problem I've been facing, this also seems to only be happening with my built-in laptop speakers, and not with any bluetooth/wired headphones.\n If any other information is needed I'll gladly bring it up, but I believe (currently) that this is the best I can do.

I didn't try installing it directly with dpkg though, maybe that's worth a try (but even then, this wouldn't be my preferred way since then I would have to create a dummy deb for each package I don't want).\n    submitted by    /u/that_leaflet  \n [link]   [comments]",

If i unhook the ethernet and power it up be default to wlan which is good.. but if I reconnect the ethernet it still defaults to wlan and i have to ssh back in and run the replace default gw command again.
