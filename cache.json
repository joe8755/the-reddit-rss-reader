The implementation follows the BLIS) design, works for arbitrary matrix sizes, and, when fine-tuned for an AMD Ryzen 7700 (8 cores), outperforms NumPy (=OpenBLAS), achieving over 1 TFLOPS of peak performance across a wide range of matrix sizes. \n By efficiently parallelizing the code with just 3 lines of OpenMP directives, it’s both scalable and easy to understand. Throughout this tutorial, we'll implement matrix multiplication from scratch, learning how to optimize and parallelize C code using matrix multiplication as an example. This is my first time writing a blog post. If you enjoy it, please subscribe and share it! I would be happy to hear feedback from all of you.\n This is the first part of my planned two-part blog series. In the second part, we will learn how to optimize matrix multiplication on GPUs.

          "description": "I am writing a game and I am wondering about memory allocation. Obviously just using the stack is not enough as sometimes longer term allocations are required. But suppose I can put an upper bound on the memory required for my game, and just allocate a static buffer for it:\n uint8_t mem[200MB]; \n I have a few questions about this approach:\n  \nInternally, what is the difference between these two? For malloc() my understanding is that some memory is requested from the OS (which maps virtual addresses to the physical memory) and then malloc does its own book keeping. I don't know how the static array method works under the hood though. (If the difference is not defined by the C standard or anything like that, it would be helpful to know how they tend to differ in practice.)\n Kind of related to the first question: if they are implemented differently, would would be an example of a time when the mallocing X bytes would fail but the static array would succeed, and vice versa. Which is the more reliable way?\n In terms of speed considerations, is this a good strategy?\n On a \"modern\" machine (say 8GB ram, decent cpu, etc.) as a rough figure what is a reasonable range to allocate? For example, 200MB works fine for me on my M1 MacBook Air; how much could I reasonably assume? 500MB? Gigabytes? And how does this vary between the three major operating systems?\n  \nThank you.\n    submitted by    /u/x9myi9Ks6saTYgkfNEdr  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The usefulness of realloc is limited by the fact that if the new size is larger, it may malloc a new object, memcpy the current data, and free the old object (not necessarily by directly calling these functions).\n This means realloc can't be used to extend an object if there are multiple copies of the pointer; if realloc moves stuff then boom! All those copies become dangling pointers.\n I also realized that the standard doesn't actually assure the new pointer \"shall be\" same if the object is shrunk, so at least in theory, it may get deallocated and moved anyways even if the new size is smaller.\n  \n\"The realloc function deallocates the old object pointed to by ptr and returns a pointer to a new object that has the size specified by size.\"\n  \nhttps://port70.net/~nsz/c/c11/n1570.html#7.22.3.5p2\n  \n\"The realloc function returns a pointer to the new object (which may have the same value as a pointer to the old object), or a null pointer if the new object could not be allocated.\"\n  \nhttps://port70.net/~nsz/c/c11/n1570.html#7.22.3.5p4\n I'm wondering if there's any non-standard library which provides a more programmer-friendly version of realloc, in the sense that it would *never\\* deallocate the current object. If the size can't be extended (due to insufficient free space after), it simply returns NULL, and \"trusting the programmer\" with what happens next (old object is retained).\n Or it can still allocate a new object, copy the old stuff, and return the pointer *without\\* deallocating the old object. The programmer has to free the old object, which admittedly increases the chances of memory leak (should the programmer forget), but it certainly avoids the problem of dangling pointers.\n I also hope the standard library provides such an alternative in future, it will be welcomed by many programmers.\n    submitted by    /u/cHaR_shinigami  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I understand that there is not a \"total package\" like for Java)? .. is there some auto-generative list that will create/download such package?\n Different flavors seem to exist, so I run Linux and I like the bash .. what is suitable?\n .. I am interested in mainly doing regex work.\n Thank you very much!\n Edit: I have tried to find answers to the questions and there is _a lot to read_ but I do not want to learn programming, and I do not want to switch from java to c, .. I just want to use it\n    submitted by    /u/artistictrickster8  \n [link]   [comments]",

I mean, the structure is made of uncountable \"customizers\" that you can append to the main library and it is full of \"anonymous functions\" that will be invoked at the right time.\n The syntax is not difficult, but reading the source code to get a full ideia of what is going on is a difficult task. I think I want to dig deeper into the code anyways, and make a diagram of the chain of invocations between registering a module and actually calling the handler when the requests comes.\n Also, they don't have a good documentation, at least I didn't find it. Please tell me if these are good ideas, if you would like to see this analysis, if my first impressions are correct and if maybe I'm wasting my time because someone already published something like that.\n Thank you very much.\n    submitted by    /u/Mountain-Cabinet-466  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I tried to make a pointer and assign it (idk if that's the right term) to an array, it was simple with a 1-D array. #include <stdio.h> int main(){ int array[] = {1,2,3}; int *ptr = array; return 0; } I wrote this code and it compiled just fine. However when I tried to do the same with a 2-D array, just doing this wasn't enough: #include <stdio.h> int main(){ int array[2][3] = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}; int *ptr = array; return 0; } I had to write: \"int *ptr = &array[0][0];\" for it to work, so I wanted to ask why didn't it work that way, did I do something wrong or does the \"int *ptr = array;\" line only works for 1-D arrays. \n    submitted by    /u/ARPlayz14  \n [link]   [comments]",

Should I go last to be called first, first to be called last? I've also noticed you can declare all functions at the beginning and then have the functions in whatever order. Is there any benefit to doing this, and then for example declaring them in order of when then they're called in main (this way seems most readable to me as a beginner, but I'd prefer to use a style that's common).\n    submitted by    /u/mimshipio  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been abstracting my vulkan renderer for a while now when I ran into the issue that my program would continuously crash. Using debuggers (lldb, gdb, valgrind, sanitizers, etc.), I figured out there were two places my crashes were happening at: vkCreateGraphicsPipelines, and also vkAcquireNextImageKHR (whenever I tried to create a pipeline, or render a frame). The code for the pipeline creator is here as well as a disassembly (provided by lldb), just in case that might be helpful for debugging. As you can see, I'm passing through two structs called vk_device and vk_swapchain as well, which are my attempts at abstracting and organizing my renderer even more. They're not relevant to my problem, but if you want to check the code out for that they're here, just in case I missed something important there. Static analyzers also flag my shader loader, so in case there's something going on there the code for that is here. The reason I load the shaders twice is to get the size of the shaders, create a buffer, and then read the contents into that buffer. That's probably also filled with bugs so if there's any feedback on that let me know. And the code for the frame renderer is here, along with the output of running valgrind on the program, as well as with sanitizers. Those are just snippets of the program however, and I may be completely wrong about where the errors are or you may just want to try it out for yourself, so the link to the complete project is here, (I tried to upload to github but after 3 hours of trying i just gave up and made a dropbox).\n    submitted by    /u/AnswerApprehensive19  \n [link]   [comments]",

This was my first multi file project in c snd so I want to organize it like how actual projects on GitHub are organized and use a build system for it. Since I’d mostly heard about Cmake being popular, I decided to learn how to use Cmake\n However, as I try to understand how to structure my project and use Cmake, I keep on getting more and more lost. I've seen many tutorials on the internet but they all have different methods of going about it and, till now, I haven’t found any tutorial that explains how to properly structure a library and use it with Cmake\n There are many terms in cmake that I fail to understand (such as target, static, public etc) and I don’t even think I understand the use of cmake. I thought a build system was used to compile our code in a simpler, more organized way but what I’m reading is that Cmake is a build system that builds build systems? I know how headers files, object code, linkers, etc work but I don’t understand how they work with Cmake \n Overall these are my main questions:\n How to structure a C project(specifically a library)?\n What is a build system?\n How Cmake works?\n How to build a library with Cmake?\n    submitted by    /u/Mael_The_Heretic  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A bit of a debugging story... I was writing a JIT compiler (long story); after a restructuring of the codebase and ironing out the initial bugs, I hit a really peculiar problem. It worked alright under gcc but strangely Clang failed with a segfault. The instruction in question was an access to a pointer 8 bytes before the JITted function before calling it, which was odd, because I was only calling the function and not doing anything else. It was a compare with this constant 0xc105cafe which looked out of place and seemed very much like hexspeak. Looking it up on a search engine lead me straight to a source file in clang's source code. Turns out that if UBSan is enabled, then Clang (undocumentedly) requires that the two words before the entry of every function be accessible. They claim that a function where the previous two bytes are not accessible is \"not reasonable for application or library code\", and the maintainers don't want to fix it for (annoyingly legitimate AFAICT) performance reasons. (Sorry for my horrendous English, by the way)\n TL;DR: When using UBSan, Clang uses a workaround that requires the two words before all functions being accessible, a function where is considered \"unreasonable\". My JIT (like most others I would think) uses mmap to get pages for writing bytecode to (so they can be made executable later) and when compiled under UBSan/Clang, calling the JITted function segfaults because of said hack.\n    submitted by    /u/carpintero_de_c  \n [link]   [comments]",

As I was implementing my own webserver at epollix, I needed a form parsing library that handles files well. I did not find any, or rather everything I tried failed miserably. First it was https://github.com/iafonov/multipart-parser-c but it uses callbacks and failed to handle binary files. Then tried to write it in rust and use it in C using the multipart create, it also failed. Perhaps its a skill issue or binary files are hard. Then I tried again with this https://github.com/abiiranathan/multipart_rs_multer project using the multer create in Rust. For some reason, It could not handle pdf and image uploads but plain/text files worked. I decided to implement it myself in C with a simple API, with minimal allocations, zero copy for file content.\n Check it out and be kind: https://github.com/abiiranathan/libmultipart\n As you can imagine, feedback is highly welcome. \n    submitted by    /u/No-Standard6314  \n [link]   [comments]",

The library was inspired by this rust based deferred formatting library defmt.\n Hope it's okay to post here as this library has two halves, one in C and another in Rust.\n On the C side the library is a header-only library, that requires some modifications to the linker script, and only requires gnu c99 (or maybe even 89) (which is supported by most compilers).\n The C related part sits in cdefmt/include/cdefmt.h\n All of the log strings are being embedded into the resulting `.elf` file. which can be later stripped before being flashed to the device or running on the host.\n The resulting logs are very small, only the size of a pointer per log + whatever arguments were sent to the log.\n Once the device generates the logs, they can be parsed using a library I wrote in rust.\n Given the logs' binary stream and the original elf, the logs can be reconstructed and the parameter's types are inferred from the debugging information encoded in the elf.\n There's support for format hints, enum name lookup and more.\n Currently the code reached a minimum viable product status, there's quite a bit of cleanup and documentation to be done and some missing features to implement, however I thought now would be a good time to share the library and get some feedback.\n An example is provided and validated on a linux system.\n Small example of a log:\n typedef struct some_struct { uint64_t a; uint32_t b; uint16_t c; } some_struct_t; struct some_struct some_struct = { .a = 1234567890123456789, .b = 1234567890, .c = 12345, }; CDEFMT_INFO(\"some struct: {}\", some_struct); \n And the parsed log:\n Info > some struct: {a: 1234567890123456789, b: 1234567890, c: 12345} \n TL;DR: I made a logging library that I think is pretty cool.\n Link: https://github.com/RisinT96/cdefmt\n    submitted by    /u/RisinT96  \n [link]   [comments]",

It found a lot more long/int mismatch errors, returns without a value, and functions without prototypes and the obsolete 'caddr_t' type. Both compilers seem to be defaulting to std=c17. Same source files and makefiles. So is there some secret environment variable or config file that is telling compiler to go full nitpicking mode? I don't object to fixing up the flaws, just curious why compiler behaves so differently.\n    submitted by    /u/VS2ute  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or does it just generate binary for whatever source code is given to it without caring about anything else (except the target platform for which it is designed of course)?\n Also, according to the knowledge I've gathered, it should be totally possible for you to not use the standard library at all (I mean there is literally a nostdlib option in GCC), right? After all it is just a library in the end. There's also the prospect of the runtime library, which I think is just startup and exit routine (crt0.o. Please correct me if I am wrong).

I've been reading some codebases, but haven't been able to decide what is the best way to do the following: I have a function that parses command line arguments:\n struct args { ... bunch of arguments struct some_other_struct* ptrmember; } struct args args_parse(int argc, const char **argv); \n This initial version returns struct args by value. I'm not entirely sure if it is the way to go, since it is a somewhat large struct (5 members), more importantly, the ptrmember member inside needs to be free'd, and it feels like returning a struct by value implies that there is no cleanup needed. I'm also not sure if I should make the caller responsible for free'ing free(args.ptrmember) or have a args_free function which does it.\n Some alternatives that may be better:\n int args_parse(int argc, const char **argv, struct args* out); \n  \nAdded benefit of having return value.\n Allows caller to decide whether to allocate args on heap or put it on stack.\n Still it is not entirely clear as to whether the caller is responsible for free'ing ptrmember I feel like (since it is allocated by args_parse, but the caller initialized the containing struct).\n  \nOr may be the C way is to not use a struct at all and just have a bunch of out parameters like so:\n int args_parse(int argc, const char **argv, enum action* out_action, struct some_other_struct* out_ptrmember); \n  \nThis one makes it very clear that the caller is responsible for freeing out_ptrmember IMO, but I'm not sure if it is best practice to use out variables so liberally here.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/aangebrandpannenkoek  \n [link]   [comments]",

Which makes the call complicated for the compiler to optimize and then continues to make the processors job harder, by making it more likely to mis-predict the function call and thus waste cycles restarting the pipeline. Restarting the pipeline can take 5 to 15 cycles. A modern processor executes about 2 instructions per cycle. If you need to interface two pieces of code together that are not developed at the same time by the same people, use a header file. Let the compiler and linker collapse the abstraction away, so the processor isn't bothered by extra work and an unpredictable workload.\n  \nMy question is what does this look like in practice? What is a simple example showing how one header file can extend the functionality of another header file similar to virtual methods in a language like Java?

          "description": "I've always wanted to contribute something to the open source community. This is a pretty small fun project if you want to get your feet wet with networking. It's a Multiplayer Flappy bird game (just rectangles) written purely in C using Raylib and LibUV. The client sends inputs to the server which sends back gamestates at a fixed interval. The gamestates are rendered with a 100ms render delay to allow packets from the server to arrive (keeping gameplay consistently smooth). It does not have any client side prediction but it is a very simple design for getting into multiplayer game development. The core of the code is contained in two files (server.c and client.c). Gameloop has collision detection, response, very basic physics, map collision loading and rendering.\n If you'd like to test it by yourself , change kMaxNumberOfPlayers in gameshared.h to 1 and launch server then client.\n https://github.com/lolirelia/Flappy.git\n    submitted by    /u/oneuglycat  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Although not strictly necessary in functional programming, I like to maintain the dependency inversion principle by using dependency injection to maintain control inversion and keep my modules independent from each other. Practically I've always achieved this by always having some kind of \"init\" function in all but my highest level modules that accepts function pointers. This allows the higher level modules that are dependent on this module to \"inject\" pointers to \"callback\" functions.\n I found myself questioning if passing these functions pointers at runtime, given that I don't ever expect them to change, is really the optimal solution here. Alternative ways to achieve this that I can think of are forward declaring the function I need, or just having circular dependencies. These both seems to significantly complicate life for the linker and feel I like that's bad practice.\n Actually, I guess I don't really understand why you would ever forward declare a function vs just giving the external function a header and including that, maybe that's part of the issue here?\n Maybe I'm architecting this fundamentally wrong, or maybe I'm just over thinking things, I'd love any feedback.\n Edit: I probably should have a given a code example from the beginning:\n main.c\n include \"timer.h\" void timerCallback(void){ doThings(); } int main(void){ initTimer(timerCallback); startTimer(); } \n timer.h\n void initTimer(void(*callback)(void)); void startTimer(void); \n timer.c\n include \"timer.h\" static void(*execCallback)(void); void initTimer(void(*callback)(void)){ execCallback = callback; } void startTimer(void){ wait(1000); execCallback(); } \n Its kind of a dumb example it gets the point across, I'm basically asking what the optimal way is to call the timerCallback func defined in main from timer.c\n    submitted by    /u/MikeExMachina  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! I am trying to understand how constness works for double pointers, and so far, my answer is \"it doesn't\".\n From what I've read, the way the const qualifier works for a pointer is that if the const qualifier is before the *, then the constness applies to the thing being pointed at, while if the const qualifier is after the * then it applies to the pointer itself. Therefore a const int * is a pointer that you can have point to multiple things without issue, but cannot change the value being pointed at. For double pointers, the logic I have says that const int ** dp is a double pointer where you can edit dp, dp[0], but not dp[0][0]. and const int *const * dp means I can change dp, but neither dp[0], nor dp[0][0]. However, when I actually use this, I get weird compiler errors that tell …",

I have learned C for almost a decade and I know a lot of things about memory, CPU, pointers, binary etc etc. I can reason about C code and I can investigate and study it. I can write small programs and functions with ease, but I have troubles when it comes to building an actual application.\n When I write code for projects it feels as if I'm doing everything wrong. I seem to be obsessed with details and I have a hard time focusing on the big picture. It seems that whatever I do, in a matter of days I'd scratch everything and start all over again. Imagine you are an artist and you have a blank canvas and you sketch something, but then you hate it and you destroy the whole canvas. I've been doing that over and over with my coding.\n So how do I actually program? I'm talking about developing solid software projects rather than toying around with code. If there are good resources on the matter, I'd be extremely happy to study them, from my searches a lot of the things I've found seem to be either overly abstract and corporate or they seem to be very surface level and not what I'm looking for.

The vol 2 you don't normally read, but rather just skim it if you have time.\n \nI’ve only read Unix Network Programming Volume 1. But Unix Network Programming pairs very well with Volume 2 of the illustrated series.\n \nVolumes 2 and 3 are more about the actual code used to implement the protocols, so unless you're going to be writing such code (or are just curious), you can probably safely skip those.\n \n The preface to UNIX Network Programming itself claims that TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 2) is a good complimentary read:\n  \nTCPv2 contains a high level of detail very closely related to the material in this book, as it describes and presents the actual 4.4BSD implementation of the network programming functions for the sockets API (socket, bind, connect, and so on). If one understands the implementation of a feature, the use of that feature in an application makes more sense.\n  \nSo is it fair to assume that I should read TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 1), then TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 2), and finally UNIX Network Programming, or is that overkill? From what I could glean, the general opinion is that TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 1) and UNIX Network Programming seem to be enough.

But assuming it is, my next assertion is then: \"the world's foremost expert in c could look at my code; detect unsafe practices; and render it safe.\n And if that is all true, then I am puzzled why a machine can't do that for me (us). Isn't that something the compiler should be doing? And if that's too difficult, surely AI can be trained to know the patterns of unsafe code and require the programmer to explicitly reject the proferred 'corrections' and insist upon compiling the code as is. Isn't that what Rust basically does (e.g. permit the programmer to write in 'unsafe mode'?)\n I assume what I propose cannot be done or it already would be done. But for the life of me, I cannot figure out where my logic breaks down. Can someone help educate me why unsafe c code can't be identified by a machine (compiler or other AI code)?\n edit: 10:38: To clarify, I guess I am asking: aren't most 'unsafe practices' something that follow certain patterns that someone who has coded in c for a living for a sufficient number of years would be able to detect right away?

With no external dependencies and a modular structure, it provides flexibility for various projects. \n Although RSGL is a graphics library, it only handles graphics data. rendering must be done externally of RSGL.h. By default, RSGL includes RSGL_gl.h which is a opengl backend for RSGL. \n RSGL also includes a small window abstraction over RGFW but you can use any windowing library with RSGL. RSGL includes an example for using RSGL with GLFW.\n Other than being very dynamic and modular in use, RSGL is also designed to be very lightweight, the current release, this includes compiled binaries, is only ~500kb and the header itself is only 120kb. \n Here is a simple example of how to use RSGL\n #define RSGL_IMPLEMENTATION #include \"RSGL.h\" int main(void) { // create a window at the center of the screen RSGL_window* win = RSGL_createWindow(\"name\", (RSGL_rect){500, 500, 500, 500}, RSGL_CENTER); // create a toggle rounded button in light mode RSGL_button toggle = RSGL_initButton(); RSGL_button_setPolygon(&toggle, RSGL_RECT(50, 125, 100, 50), 36); RSGL_button_setStyle(&toggle, RSGL_STYLE_LIGHT | RSGL_STYLE_TOGGLE | RSGL_STYLE_ROUNDED); // while the should should stay open while (RGFW_window_shouldClose(win) == false) { // loop through each event to avoid lag while (RSGL_window_checkEvent(win)) { // check button info RSGL_button_update(&toggle, win->event); } // draw a rectangle RSGL_drawRect(RSGL_RECT(200, 200, 200, 200), RSGL_RGB(255, 0, 0)); // draw the button RSGL_drawButton(toggle); // clear the screen (and render) RSGL_window_clear(win, RSGL_RGB(100, 100, 100)); } // close the window and free everything RSGL_window_close(win); } \n    submitted by    /u/Comrade-Riley  \n [link]   [comments]",

My first idea of how this might be implemented is something like this:\n static_assert(_proven_impossible(i == 10));\n In the above example the following would hypothetically cause a compiler error, because the programmer’s assumption about their code could be proven incorrect at compile time:\n static_assert(_proven_possible(i == 15));\n But maybe it’s possible to get a printout of possible and impossible ranges (as far as the compiler knows) for specific variables at specific points in the program:\n _known_possible_ranges(i);\n Also maybe there are tools that can do this?\n Edit:\n Several People seem to have misunderstandings about my question, this may be my fault, so I want to make this clear:\n My question is NOT about TELLING the compiler what is possible, I know about things like _builtin_assume, _builtin_unreachable my question is if there is a way to EXTRACT INFORMATION which states the compiler could prove that my program can or can never reach, some kind of assert macro that works on non constant expressions but is still evaluated at compile time. I also know that this can not always be done, some things that the compiler can’t prove are impossible will still be impossible, due to the halting problem, but the compiler in practice already proves some situations to be possible/impossible for optimisation.\n    submitted by    /u/the-judeo-bolshevik  \n [link]   [comments]",

The code starts with an initial partition, and then tries various strategies (about 15 strategies) to improve the partition.\n Some of these strategies can be used in any order. Some are reasonable to use only after some other ones have been tried. Some can be used inside or outside other strategies.\n These strategies are more or less useful depending on the type of network that is given. Hence, I would like to give the user as much freedom as possible in mixing and matching these strategies, but I am not sure how to best structure that in the code.\n An example: say the strategies are A, B, C, D. Then I would like to user to be able to select:\n  \nA only\n A then C then B\n B then A then C\n A with C enabled inside, then D, then C again.\n A with C disabled inside, then C.\n  \netc. Another complication is that some of these strategies (like A and D) require some data structures to be maintained, while others (like B and C) don't. So if A and D are done consecutive then I don't want to re-build the data structures, but if A and D are not consecutive, then I do want to re-build them.\n Is there any general advice you can give for this situation, or a code base or book I can look at for inspiration?\n Thank you very much.\n    submitted by    /u/LearningStudent221  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've made a program for school; that goes through a plain text file and makes a concordance for each word. It will take each word, remove non-alphabetical characters from the front and back, and put it into a Binary Search Tree. When encountering Multi-Byte Unicode characters in a text, you get random ascii characters that make up the multibyte character instead of what it is: for example, \"yarns—and,\" is outputted as \"yarnsùand.\" I spent hours months ago and this week trying to solve this problem, so what do I do?\n https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/38242/Reading-UTF-8-with-C-streams#mozTocId353176 This article seemed useful. But not being able to read in utf-8 is a solved problem, so making up a facet didn't seem useful. I didn't try it though because of that. Using imbue(utf8_locale/utf16_locale) does not help nor does imbuing wsstream with codecvt, Here is a MRE of the bug. I used wstring because when I made this program and went back to it I didn't know how unicode worked until recently.\n #include <string> #include <iostream> #include <fstream> #include <windows.h> #include <consoleapi2.h> using namespace std; int main() { wfstream file; file.open(\"Example.txt\", ios::in); // Changes buffer from char to wchar_t wchar_t* buffer = new wchar_t[100]; file.rdbuf()->pubsetbuf(buffer, 100); wchar_t CurrentStreamCharacter = file.get(); wstring NewWord = L\"\"; while (file) { NewWord.push_back(CurrentStreamCharacter); CurrentStreamCharacter = file.get(); } //SetConsoleOutputCP(65001); wcout << NewWord << endl; wcout << \"yarns—and even convictions.

In many discussions they claim that those function do throw an error, but that might be compiler benevolence.\n The question is how do you really detect out of range/overflow? I mean what if the user inputs ULLONG_MAX+1 in the string - then the function will return simply ULLONG_MAX and I will have no idea.\n My wrappaer function is expected to return false to signify that the input string cannot be converted (as is and accurately). Converting to float will present an inaccuracy which is not acceptable.\n Is there a good solution, or do I just re-invent the wheel a rewrite the standard function to check the value after each character to implement the exception handling? I'm happy to use any other standard function if there is such.\n EDIT: The project is on C++11; std::from_chars is C++17\n    submitted by    /u/FrumAkul    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I need the window reference for this class, but I don't know the best way to handle this situation.\n My first thought is to make a pointer to a GLFWwindow and initialize it in the constructor with the window I created in the main function. No new, no delete, just copy the memory address. Is this a good approach? \n One problem with this could be freeing the window before deleting the Test object in the main function. That would cause the memory address to be invalid, and if I try to access it from the Test class it would give an error. Maybe a better approach is to use shared pointers, which don't get freed unless there are no references the object?\n    submitted by    /u/Just_Philosopher_942    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have written a simple event manager which allows systems to raise events through a namespace named EventManager, which contains a bunch of static inline Events. The idea is that any module in our programme can add events to this namespace, and any module can access any event by including the header from the relevant module. This decouples all the modules quite nicely. Admittedly it means everything is strongly coupled to the event manager, but we find that acceptable. We consider this EventManager a foundational component of the system so we are willing to tolerate that coupling, in the same way you'd tolerate coupling to the STL I guess!\n We can add callbacks to this event manager at any point, but one thing I don't like about it is that we have to call remove_callback() manually using …",

Also can a class know if a pointer is in use by another part of the code?\n I ask the question because I have class that has a pointer, it passes it to a Vulkan function and I want to delete the pointer, but how am I sure that's it's not being used by the library.\n Also if multiple instances and/or classes share the same pointer but I want to destroy the pointer only if all instances are destroyed, how do i keep track of that without smart pointers.\n I decided to use shared_ptr but people here seem to say that the overhead is not worth if someone knows how to properly use raw pointers.

          "description": "Hello, recently I've been intrigued by this post in particular and have been reading up on RCU. However, I am currently looking through the implementation of RCU in Folly (specifically this implementation).\n In particular, I am confused about this section. I believe that the current implementation uses Epoch-Based Reclamation and half_sync(...) is just to increment the current epoch (version_) and perform reclamation on those memory associated with epoch - 2(If we consider the value increment at the end the current epoch). However, the comment in the retirefunction confuses me. It states the following:\n  \nNote that it's likely we hold a read lock here, so we can only half_sync(false). half_sync(true) or a synchronize() call might block forever.\n  \nI don't see how retire could deadlock if we choose half_sync(true) or synchronize() instead, so any insights around this issue would be much appreciated.\n Edit: Formatting.\n    submitted by    /u/NekrozQliphort    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

One thing I've taken for granted in Java/IntelliJ is being able to 'jump' into a function (i.e. take me to function definition) for java.util (i.e. stdlib equivalent) files and get very clear documentation on what a function does and how to use it. For example, ArrayList::add :\n /** * Appends the specified element to the end of this list. * * @param e element to be appended to this list * @return {@code true} (as specified by {@link Collection#add}) */ public boolean add(E e) ... \n When I do the same from CLion for a roughy-equivalent example, vector::emplace_back this is what I see:\n template <class _Tp, class _Allocator> template <class... _Args> _LIBCPP_CONSTEXPR_SINCE_CXX20 inline #if _LIBCPP_STD_VER >= 17 typename vector<_Tp, _Allocator>::reference #else void #endif vector<_Tp, _Allocator>::emplace_back(_Args&&... __args) { if (this->__end_ < this->__end_cap()) { __construct_one_at_end(std::forward<_Args>(__args)...); } else __emplace_back_slow_path(std::forward<_Args>(__args)...); #if _LIBCPP_STD_VER >= 17 return this->back(); #endif } \n I understand I can find the info I'm looking for on cppreference.com, but this workflow seems less-than-ideal.

          "description": "Like the title says. I am currently working on a game in C++/Java where the rendering part is done in C++. I am using MinGW as my compiler on Windows and GCC on Linux. I have come to the point I can share an early version of my game with friends but all of them keep getting errors that dependent libraries could not be located. I have 4 devices at home from which 1 is a Windows machine. And my game runs on all of them. So imagine my surprise.\n One of my friends is a gamedev too and after much trial and error we learned he was missing dll files that are located in my MinGW bin folder. After providing these dll files the game ran. But I thought I got rid that problem by linking to libgcc and libstdc++ statically.\n While it works now I still rather not be forced to share that whole bunch of dll files to my players when the game releases. So I was wondering if I am doing it right. Here is the part of my CMakeLists file:\n ```\n Generate variables for the compiler and linker\n set(ARQ_LIBRARIES glfw freetype soloudw dl -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -Wl,-rpath='$ORIGIN:$ORIGIN/lib')\n if (WIN32) set(ARQ_LIBRARIES glfw3 freetype soloudw -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++) endif (WIN32)\n Configure include and link folders\n include_directories(include/)\n if (WIN32) include_directories(arqanore PUBLIC \"C:/Include\") link_directories(arqanore PUBLIC \"C:/Lib\") endif (WIN32)\n link_libraries(${ARQ_LIBRARIES})\n Configure arqanore\n add_library(arqanore ${ARQ_INCLUDE} ${ARQ_SRC}) set_target_properties(arqanore PROPERTIES POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON) set_target_properties(arqanore PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME \"arqanore\") set_target_properties(arqanore PROPERTIES VERSION ${ARQ_VERSION}) ```\n And this a screenshot of some of the dll files from MinGW I was talking about: https://imgur.com/OZvzXKa.

If it was a grayscale image, I could have done this:\n // This is not exactly my code but I'm trying to simplify for (int y = 0; y < image.height; y++) { for (int x = 0; x < image.width; x++) { image.data[x + y * image.width] = value; } } \n but what about an rgb image ?\n I tried this:\n for (int y = 0; y < image.height; y++) { for (int x = 0; x < image.width; x++) { // i for channel Index for (int i = 0; i < image.numChannels; i++) { image.data[(x + y * image.width) * image.numChannels + i] = value; } } } \n This formula (x + y * image.width) * image.numChannels + i works mostly fine except some artifacts on the right and bottom edges but the other problem is that the address sanitizer and my attempts at debugging confirm there is a buffer overrun.\n This is NOT an issue of x and y values because in my actual code they are clamped between 0 and width for x and 0 and height for y.\n I think the issue is that when when x and y become too big the formula just gives very large values. When x become the width and y become the height, the formula becomes (width + height*width) * numChannels which is larger than width * height * numChannels.\n So what is the right formula for indexing values in a mulitchannel image ?\n    submitted by    /u/Dark_Lord9    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all. I've been looking into the ways to create \"global\" (not truly global but in a namespace) constants. My understanding is that simply declaring something as const or constexpr is not enough, as const implies static, and therefore you can run into ODR violations if the address of such a constant is ever required.\n So from what I've read it seems that the preferable solution is to mark constants at the namespace level as inline constexpr, as this will cause the compiler to inline the constant value where-ever it is used, effectively eliminating the need to resolve symbol definition. For situations where constexpr is not available (such as std::map), or where inlining is not appropriate, the next best solution is to declare it as extern const and defining it in a single .cpp file. Additionally, if a constant is declared in used only in a single .cpp file, then it should be marked as static and/or wrapped in an annoymous namespace.\n How correct is this understanding? I've found it a bit confusing understanding how static and inline change meaning and function between namespace, class and function contexts. Have I understood what inline does correctly?\n    submitted by    /u/FernwehSmith    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

In my opinion, the old space can be moved to a new location using bulk memory copy methods (like memcpy) faster. \n One may say about reference invalidation, but it is also the case for both methods. \n    submitted by    /u/kivancg    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Class_1 has a member Class_2 object, and Class_2 has a member Class_1 object. Now if I do a forward declaration of Class_2 before Class_1 definition, I have an incomplete type error, which is expected. So I change the attribute to a pointer to Class_2. However, if I do a forward declaration if Class_1 before Class_2, I get no errors and the code compiles. Why is it an error in one file but not the other? Is it just that the compiler went through Class_1 first so when it got to Class_2, Class_2 was complete? It does seem to go through the files in alphabetical order, since switching the content of the files still gives an error on the same file, but this is a bit weird. \n If someone can tell me what's happening, I would greatly appreciate it.

New SSID is: \"; params.echo_val = ECHO_VAL_ON; params.refresh_flag = refresh_flag; was_called = 1; } // An auxiliary function that needs aforementioned 6 values. cmd_aux_set_config(&params); } \n The idea is that if I ever need to customize my struct type, I won't break anything if I change the order of its members. Code fragility is therefore reduced.\n Does it look OK? Nothing silly or overengineered?\n UPD: struct type is\n typedef struct set_config_params_t { char *cmd; uint32_t addr; bool decimal_only; const char *topic; bool echo_val; bool *refresh_flag; } set_config_params_t; \n    submitted by    /u/ErlingSigurdson    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

My idea is to define a 'std::function' type that returns another 'std::function' that takes the same set of parameters as it (ie; function A takes parameters a,b,c, and can return any other function that takes parameters a,b,c). To that end I've declared the following type alias;\n using GroupingFSMFunc = std::function<GroupingFSMFunc(char c, TokenList& token_list, std::string& working_string)>; \n Later on I have declared this function:\n GroupingFSMFunc groupingFSM_Default(char c, TokenList& token_list, std::string& working_string) { // Some other stuff. return groupingFSM_Default; } \n I'm getting two particular errors at the moment\n  \n`function groupingFSM_Default returns incomplete type GroupingFSMFunc`\n `cannot convert to incomplete class std::__1::function<<error-type>>`\n  \nI have checked thoroughly and all required headers are included, and all types are fully defined. So my guess as to this error is that the return type of the std::function is the same as the name of the alias. Upon review I can understand how this would be a problem. So my question is, what is the correct way to declare a function type that returns a function with the same parameters as it?\n    submitted by    /u/FernwehSmith    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there,\n I would like some guidance on how to proceed when creating/using an equivalent to Module Bundler for C++.\n Look, I know that this doesn't have great functionality in the context of C++, as it has the linker and preprocessor in the compilers that will do most of the equivalent process and in a much better way.\n I'm an undergraduate, using the language, I realised that most of the required activities are based on the same snippets of code, which, with a little effort, I managed to generalise, I created a library for that.\n I managed to configure the whole environment, create unit tests and so on, but the format of the activities does not allow me to send the compiled code, nor to use a library I created. Each activity accepts only one source file, which contains everything that needs to be implemented, except the precompiled header files from the standard C++ library.\n In this way, an equivalent to a module bundler in C++ would be very useful to organise dependencies in a priority way, so that declarations come before uses, with the standard library include directives at the top of the file. \n I am not here to ask for an explanation of how the language works. I'm using Python to create this \"module bundler\", I've made a lot of progress, but... I'm stagnating, I don't know what tools to use to interact with the C++ files without reinventing the wheel.\n It's worth noting that I organised the library into two directories: \n  \ninclude, which contains the header files;\n \nsrc, which contains the implementations;\n \n If you have any suggestions, I'm open to them.\n In any case, thanks for your attention.\n    submitted by    /u/Living_Bobcat_5403    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Need to remember to go and change the other\n Dealing with things like static functions makes it even worse.\n In Java, I would get excited whenever I came up with an idea for a new utility class since it meant there was about to be a simpler and more satisfying way to do some tedious task. In C++, I just find myself dreading having to deal with this headache and asking if the class is really necessary.\n My point with all of this: is there some kind of shortcut, addon, etc that automatically generates the prototypes for you and syncs existing prototypes to existing definitions so you can change both at once?

To fill this gap, I developed the C++ Include Helper extension.\n This extension scans your project for class definitions and provides autocompletion for class names as you type. When you select a class from the suggestions, it automatically inserts the necessary #include directive at the top of your file. No more manual typing or hunting down the right headers!\n Key Features: - Automatic Workspace Analysis: Scans your workspace for class names and keeps them updated. - Smart Autocompletion: Provides class name suggestions and adds the corresponding #include to the top of your file. - Manual Trigger Option: You can manually refresh the class mappings at any time.\n I would love for you all to try it out and share your feedback!\n Check out the extension: - GitHub Repository - VS Code Marketplace\n Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or report issues. Let's make coding in C++ on VS Code even better together!\n Happy coding!\n    submitted by    /u/Complex-Ad-9151    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll provide the code below.\n main.cpp:\n #include <iostream> #include \"greet.hpp\" int main () { messaging::greet(\"John\"); return 0; } \n greet.cpp:\n #include <iostream> namespace messaging{ void greet(std::string name) { std::cout << \"Hey \" << name; } \n }\n greet.hpp:\n  #ifndef GREET_HPP #define GREET_HPP #include <string> namespace messaging{ void greet(std::string name); } #endif \n Any help/insight for this problem would be appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/bummysaikikusuo    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Capturing this satisfies the linker for gcc but makes no difference for clang. Adding inline (regardless of capture) fixes things for both.\n I read previously that omitting inline on a member function declared within the class definition in a module interface has somewhat similar behaviour as if the function implementation were in a cpp file. However in the case of deduced return type, splitting declaration and definition in that way wouldn't be allowed; regardless I'm unsure how that relates to these errors, and it's not clear to me that there should be anything wrong with omitting inline in this case.\n Compiler Explorer link: https://godbolt.org/z/Knfjf3aMe\n    submitted by    /u/kamrann_    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since I wasn't really dealing with ultra low latency requirements my C++ knowledge is not that deep but I believe that with the right resources and my background, I could probably gain enough knowledge to be at least inter-viewable.\n Here are some of my questions I have about the role:\n  \n1. If I can demonstrate that I am very proficient in low latency C++ without having worked in the finance domain, do I have a chance to get hired?\n Does a middle aged applicant have any disadvantages when applying or is it viewed an asset to be more experienced.\n Are C++ engineers in the HFT world just backoffice resources who are kept in the dark and code or is there any customer interaction or business trips to meet with clients and other colleges?\n Finally, I know there is a lot of online C++ training and lots of books that touch on the subject. I usually learn much better if those elements are taught in a project specific way . I am hoping there is an excellent course out there that lets you build an actual low latency trading platform from ground up , teaching you a fundamental concept at each step. The only resource I have found is this book:Building low latency applications with C++. Does anyone know if there is an actual course out there that uses this approach , I tried Udemy and Plurasight but couldn't find anything.\n  \nThank you in advance for any response.\n Sid\n    submitted by    /u/sidmanazebo    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is a strange position to be in, as I can be coding quite complicated C++ code (or rather quite complicated program features, in code I am sure is nowhere near as effective as it could be).\n All while not really understanding why I am doing what I am doing.\n Which means I also find tutorials at beginner's level incredibly boring (and not being worth my time) while advanced stuff just, well, loses me pretty fast. Maybe good to know I do not come from an engineering/CS background. I did a 2y education that was very hands-on, and have very little knowledge of the hardware side of programming for example.\n I have 3 small children and a full time job, so time is limited.

So virtual functions are on the table just for the mechanism of enforcing an implementation of a specific API\n Runtime cost is not so important here. The cost of pointer indirection with virtual functions is negligble here. So I can afford using virtual functions even though I don't really require the runtime aspect of it.\n  \nIMO the main reason to use virtual functions over templates - template implementations generally have to be placed in the header file, which is not ideal.\n IMO the main reason to use templates over virtual functions - I'm a strong believer of using the \"weakest\" tool needed for the job. This makes the intention of your code clear and concise.\n The runtime aspect provided by virtual functions seems like an overkill, and in terms of readability, future readers will have to read the code and scratch their heads just to figure out if runtime polymorphism was needed here or not.\n In general, it feels like template+concepts is the way that C++ seems to want me to do stuff (correct me if you think this is wrong) when all I need is compile-time polymorphism.\n Non of the reasons mentioned above convince me in any direction.\n Which would you choose in this case, virtual functions, or templates+concepts? Are there any other options/arguments I'm missing here?\n    submitted by    /u/SnooMemesjellies8458    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

The pay is good, slightly better than what FAANG companies offer locally, and the workload is reasonable (45-50 hours per week). However, I've been feeling somewhat adrift for the past few months.\n My current role mainly involves maintenance and resolving production tickets, which isn't as fulfilling as working on new projects. I love when I am assigned tasks which are thought provoking and needs good development design, but opportunities for this seem limited at my current company, where the team is small and mostly senior.\n I have made a good foundation in Linux, networking, and C++ compilers, and I'm passionate about modern C++ and systems software. I also have a keen interest in the finance sector. Despite my current dissatisfaction, I'm hesitant to leave my job due to the unstable job market, and I acknowledge that it is a good position overall.\n I’m reaching out to ask for advice on skills I should develop, projects I could undertake, or potential career paths that could help me find more fulfillment and alignment with my interests.

I understand the pros and cons of singletons, and I've seen the Double-Checked Locking Pattern as well as Meyer's Singleton in C++11 and forward (which I prefer, for simplicity).\n I'm open to debate on singletons as a design pattern, but more or less I believe they are useful in game-engines and games themselves.\n My question is about which subsystems they should be used in specifically. Which game subsystems should be singletons? Can you make a strong argument that they shouldn't be used at all?\n I'll assume for the moment that an engine-editor is outside the scope of this post, and we're just talking about an engine.\n To me,…",

These are returned from functions.\n The problem is that there are a finite number of distinct POSIX error enumerators in std::errc.

The .cpp file is not much interesting as it just mostly follows the paper's implementation. But the linux perf tool showed benchmarks/perf1.cpp spends the most time on these two functions which is accepted but I am not sure if it's there spending some unexpected amount of time just syscalling: FixedPool::ForcedAllocate and FixedPool::ForcedDeAllocate\n The main issue is my implementation seems to spend too much time on syscalls. And tbf I really don't have any idea about the total memory model of my implementation.\n Any kind of suggestions would be helpful well it's code-review, I am ready to face criticism. Syntax, design-decision anything. Thanks!\n Some contextes:\n Long story short that paper just describes an idea where fixed-sized pre-allocated memory might be better for constantly allocated and deallocated objects.\n I just tried to extend it with features like: some sort of thread safety, creating \"new\" fixed-sized-pool when the last pool is full...\n My idea was simple use lock-free queue for \"thread-safe\" deallocation.\n Use thread_local for per thread allocation.\n And bad c++ template magic to abstract away the API calls.\n Regarding the syscall issue:\n Wrote a few small naive benchmarking programs for posix/linux platforms. If anybody has time to check it out a gcc compiler with c++ 20 support can build on a linux platform. benchmarks/build_benchmark.bash will download google's benchmark library and build it, otherwise one can edit it to just build the small programs which can be used with linux specific profiling tools gprof/perf(recommended to remove the -pg flag).\n    submitted by    /u/IamSanjidHaque    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, some libraries require other build managers or have cmakelists that don’t work with add_subfolder. In order to use them, I precompile those libraries as static or dynamic libraries (depending on the size and their update frequency) and then I link them using target_link_libraries. The entire build process is automated using a makefile.\n As a result, the project is not as clean and easy to maintain as I would like. Therefore, I’m looking for a package manager that can handle the building process itself, without requiring to call cmake (even if it doesn’t provide some of the libraries I use. It would also be nice if it could execute some custom shell commands before or after each stage of the building process to avoid using make (as an example, if I need to compile a library not provided by that package manager, it would be great if I could specify a the commands it should execute to achieve that in each platform, so they could be executed before compiling the program). \n Basically, I’d like to replace make, conan, cmake and ninja by a single software in new programs (something like cargo), while being able to call whatever was used (cmake, scons, Conan, vcpkg…) when building legacy libraries\n Do you know if there’s something like that available for C++? Every package manager I’ve checked requires using cmake\n Edit: I forgot to clarify that it needs to support cross platform development (I need to be able to support at least Linux and windows, as we don’t use apple computers)\n    submitted by    /u/No_Mongoose6172    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was reading an article about safe vs. unsafe languages and have a question about the following part:\n “C and C++ are unsafe in a strong sense: executing an erroneous operation causes the entire program to be meaningless, as opposed to just the erroneous operation having an unpredictable result. In these languages erroneous operations are said to have undefined behavior. The C FAQ defines “undefined behavior” like this: Anything at all can happen; the Standard imposes no requirements. The program may fail to compile, or it may execute incorrectly (either crashing or silently generating incorrect results), or it may fortuitously do exactly what the programmer intended.” (https://blog.regehr.org/archives/213)\n It says “Anything at all can happen.” My question is what are some examples of anything? Because I take it this means something as potentially insidious as there being virtually no correspondence between the original logic of the program and what it is actually doing.\n    submitted by    /u/anonymous_bear_6    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I can't find any more information on this in boost docs or other sources.\n I was wondering if I'm barking at the wrong tree here or if there are more resources available to implement something like this? Would appreciate a nudge in the right direction!\n    submitted by    /u/Jackie213123    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey programmers!\n I am really new to the world of C++ or programming in general. I coded in Java for a while (for school stuff) so I understand the basics such as variables, functions, control structures, and I've worked a bit with basic data structures like Arrays, LinkedLists, Stacks, and Queues in Java. I am also fairly familiar with OOP concepts like classes, polymorphism, method overriding and overloading, encapsulation, etc in Java (though not too confident about it just yet). But given that I am still pretty new to C++ and haven't been able to wrap my head around pointers yet (and I need to start learning Cpp as soon as possible because of academic needs).\n I tried learning Java by watching videos and referring to a fat textbook and textual resources online before diving into code as my dad wanted me to have a solid understanding of concepts before starting to write code, but it never really worked out and I could never grasp basic concepts effectively. I actually learnt Java solely by diving into questions from day 1 and looking up the concepts I have didn't understand. Should I do the same for C++? Also to familiarize myself... should I solve problems on Codewars/Leetcode or directly jump into basic projects like TICTACTOE or Hangman games to familiarize myself with the syntax and progressively increase the difficulty of the projects? There are so many different opinions and this is really complicating things for me. What would be your advice to your younger self who just started programming and is confused?

There is one example of a fully-functional, compiled JXL file for iOS which proves this is doable, but I don't trust that person enough to insert his blob into my app.\n I've tried using cmake and ios-cmake toolchain to no success, but this is likely because I'm new to programming, have never compiled anything, and don't know what I'm doing.

One of the seemingly simple multiple-choice questions got me stuck because my answer was not among the options.\n At the end of the practice test, I quickly put the code into \"onlinegdb.com\" to run it, and it gave one of the options as the answer. I was baffled because this is a basic question in C++ and I couldn't solve it. I wrote the code into Visual Studio on Windows (my daily dev environment) to debug and understand where I went wrong. Surprisingly, it gave me a different output.\n The question is given below:\n include <iostream>\n int main() {\n  int x, y, z;\n  x = 5;\n  y = ++x * x--;\n  z = ++y + --y;\n  std::cout << \"x: \" << x << \"\\ny: \" << y << \"\\nz: \" << z;\n  return 0;\n }\n What are the values of x, y, and z?\n a. 5, 35, 60\n b. 4, 25, 60\n c. 5, 30, 60\n d. 5, 35, 65\n Online GDB/Linux env GCC answer: 5, 30, 60\n Visual Studio answer: 5, 36, 72\n My initial answer: 5, 36, 73\n My answer trying to apply operator precedence: 5, 25, 51.\n Can anyone help explain the discrepancies between these output?\n    submitted by    /u/PapaDonkey2024    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll remove this post if so.\n I haven't done any C or C++ since 2013-ish and want to pick the languages back up. Back then I had just finished school and briefly worked a job at a small shop where, being the lone C++ dev working entirely on my own, I learned nothing about best practices or anything, so I basically just installed dependencies locally and linked against them, and maybe ran valgrind every once in a blue moon, etc. I figure maybe that wasn't the best way to handle things, or even if it was maybe things have changed since then.\n Anyway, I was recently offered some work on a project and one of the requirements is that it must be either C or C++ and want to take a look at both again so I can decide which one I should use (plus I'm interested in exploring the game development field), so my question is: what's the most popular setup for a C/C++ dev environment? I'm talking besides IDE's/Text Editors, also tools for dependency management, static analysis, memory debugging/analysis, linters, etc. Basically anything people who are pros use to boost their productivity especially when they might be using the same PC for working on several projects...

          "description": "Hello everyone, I was reading the book \"Effective C++ - scott meyers\", and it had suggested to use const T instead of #define, and the fact that we usually declare constant in header files, etc. But I am a little confused now; Should I declare constant in header files using extern and then initialize it in a seperate .cpp file, or just define and initialize the constant fully in the header file?\n The first solution\n Well, I mean something like this:\n ```cpp // consts.hpp\n pragma once\n extern const float PI = 3.14; ```\n cpp // consts.cxx const float PI = 3.14; \n Well, already I am uncomfortable with the fact that I can mistakenly initialize this constant in two seperate files and get a linker error. But it seems more logical to keep all declrations in the header and have this seperation.\n The second solution\n Ok, the next solution is to define everything and initialize in the header like this:\n ```cpp // consts.hpp\n pragma once\n const float PI = 3.14; ```\n It seems a better solution, but I kinda just don't like initializing in the header file; Also I am not sure how exactly #pragma once works, so, could it lead to some linker errors if I include consts.hpp in several files? As long as I know, it's gonna copy the content of header to files, does it mean I'll get several definitions of the const PI in multiple files? Each object will get its own constant? Or it corrects it and it's not just a simple straight forward copy?\n Thanks for your opinions.\n Edit: I am also curious about your opinion about inline variables and constexpr for this thing.\n    submitted by    /u/ArtinIr    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

To simplify my problem, assume I have a struct:\n struct oldStruct {\n // other stuff\n unsigned char* bigarray;\n };\n Later on, I need to pass an array of oldStructs to the function I care about like so:\n coolFunction(const oldStruct* structarrayptr, // other stuff);\n So my question is basically, how can I C++ify things for safety. I already have a vector<oldStruct> and then pass to coolFunction(vector<oldStruct>.data(), ...) and that all works. But I'd really like to somehow wrap the unsigned char* bigarray in a unique_ptr, and I can't figure out how.\n I even tried making\n struct newStruct{\n // same other stuff\n std::unique_ptr<unsigned char> bigarray;\n };\n which is already dumb for just duplicating code. I was able to construct my vector<newStruct> and use it elsewhere and everything worked great, but the issue was when I tried to pass to coolFunction that it failed. There was no casting I could figure out that would cast newStruct to oldStruct. The issue I guess is that C++ isn't smart enough to use unique_ptr.get() to get the dumb pointer.\n What is the \"right\" way to deal with this situation?

Instead, symbolEvaluationOrder provides the order to evaluate the operators in, so if symbolEvaluationOrder = { 0, 1 } then that means the expression must be evaluated as (2 - 4) * 7 = -14 while if symbolEvaluationOrder = { 1, 0 } then the expression is evaluated as 2 - (4 * 7) = -26.\n With three integers this is easy. But I must be able to do this for up to 100 integers and many times in a row. Can you help me figure out an optimized way to solve this?\n    submitted by    /u/LemonLord7    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Today I stumbled over this warning message while tinkering with placement new in a larger project. To give a small outline of the scope: The goal was to create an error system in an embedded project with -fno-exception and avoiding expensive heap allocations. This is where the placement-new operator comes into play, because it allows creating abstracted error objects. Errors are global and stateful (hence the abstraction) and require a central user-defined location where these are stored. This requirement should be enforced at compile time.\n To find a solution I thought of enforcing a user-defined storage object using an extern declaration, which would throw a linker error if missing. But during testing I noticed that I instead got the compile warning (turned to an error via -Werror) from the title. The setup for that is very specific and also only works with non-zero optimization (-Og or -O1-3) \n So this got me wondering if there is any way to detect a missing storage location at compile time except linker warnings, so that I can provide a custom error message, because this pointer is null doesnt really tell the user anything, whereas undefined reference to storage does.\n I tried to narrow down the error and got the following code. Every line marked with // - was necessary to optimize for that warning.\n // compiled with g++ -c -O1 test.cpp #include <cstdint> #include <cstdio> #include <new> union Storage; static // - Storage *_StoragePtr; inline // - void setStorage(Storage *s) { _StoragePtr = s; } struct Error { virtual // - int foo() { return 1; } }; extern union Storage { Storage() { setStorage(this); } Error data; // example } storage; // user defined storage object // Storage storage; // - int main() { Error *error = new (_StoragePtr) Error(); printf(\"%i\", error->foo()); // - auto stuff = error->foo(); // - } \n    submitted by    /u/Symbroson    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to teach myself Cpp and I'm reading \"C++ Primer\" 5th Edition, and doing the exercises, and I just did exercise 1.4 where I converted an \"add two integers\" program into a \"multiply two integers\" program. I made the revisions, and built it without error, and ran it without error, at least on a variety of integers up to 4 digits long.\n But when I put in two larger integers (specifically, 56,789 and 67,890) the program ran and gave an answer that was not only the wrong number, but also was wrong in that it was negative (see screenshot below).\n https://i.ibb.co/648LVB5/Screenshot-20240615-140505.jpg\n Can anyone tell me why this happened? Could it be because the memory reserved for the calculation was not large enough for a product that had 10 digits?\n Also, I'm curious why I got a return value of 0 when there was clearly an error in the calculation somewhere.\n Finally, can anyone offer any advice on how to run down errors like this on my own without bugging redditors?

The closures are already done, but I am stuck on compiling recursive union types, so I need some help on how to do it.\n The way the question is going, I get the sense it is just going to be ignored, but I'd really want the language to support heap allocated recursive union types (like the ones F# has) in the Cuda backend, so I am reposting it here for visibility.\n Edit: It got resolved and it turns out it is a weird NVRTC related issue.

          "description": "Hi folks,\n Today I meet a weird issue when using C++20 concept. I plan to make a reference template which only allows user to pass a class derived from an 'Object' class. So I made:\n class Object; template <typename T> concept DerivedFromObject = std::is_base_of_v<Object, T>; class Object { ... }; template <typename T> requires DerivedFromObject<T> class ref { ... }; \n However, I found I cannot use it if for some kinds of class which contains methods like:\n class Resource : public Object { public: static ref<Resource> load(std::string path); }; \n It reports an error:\n An undefined class is not allowed as an argument to compiler intrinsic type trait '__is_base_of' \n It means at the moment of a member method is declared; class Resource is not complete. So that I cannot use is_base_of to check it. Do you have any idea of how to solve an issue like that?\n    submitted by    /u/sunxfancy    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

There's a boolean variable quit inside engine class that is initialised to be false inside engine.h file. \n The engine.h file includes UI.h and Window.h files to initialise, update and close window and UI. Inside the running function inside engine.h there's a running function that has\n while(!quit){ UI.update(); Window.update(); .... }\n Inside the UI's update function I want the ability to somehow change the quit to true and close stop the programme. This is because I want to be able to make a custom quit button for my application. \n What I have tried: Making a setter function for quit inside engine and trying to use it from UI's update function. But it doesn't work because I can't take or give engine as a parameter to my UI class because engine uses UI. \n What can I do? Should I change the structure of my project or am I just too dumb for not seeing any potential easy and simple solution? Any help is appreciated thank you.\n I didn't want to say it but please spare me for asking such questions actually I am a self taught student and I am not fond of reading big books about a language or watch multiple videos about a language. I started making small projects and learning on the way.... This is the first problem that I faced and didn't find solution in the internet.

My team is highly competent, so I seldom find myself contributing significantly in these instances. I've noticed that many people, upon encountering unfamiliar code, choose not to review it at all.

My motivation stems from the current limitations of std::thread in terms of customization and the complexities encountered when applying std::async and std::future to classes and containers.\n I aim to streamline concurrent programming by introducing more intuitive and flexible APIs, reducing boilerplate code, and enhancing performance through intelligent resource management akin to thread pools. This new module would not replace but complement existing standards, offering developers a more powerful toolset for managing concurrency in modern, complex applications.\n I'm eager to gauge the C++ community's thoughts on this proposal.

For example UI Manager instantiates around 30 more classe (for all the submenues, cutscenes etc..). Yes they inheret from base classes and I have an UIHandler as well, but still... in general there is so much dependency injection. I would just love to make everything global. All the classes below are also classes where there will only be 1 instance ever. Where I need more instances I usually have structs inside the DataManager. For example I have mapData struct.

The program runs, but I wan't to be able to enter the expression with or without spaces. Right now I'm using getline to get the expression from the user and then stringstream ss(expression) to parse the expression so I can get the operands and operators. I sotre operators as a char in stack a, and operands as a double in stack b. Then a switch function to do the math.\n  double applyOp(double a, double b, char op) { switch (op) { case '+': return a + b; case '-': return a - b; case '*': return a * b; case '/': return a / b; case '^': return pow(a, b); default: return 0; }  Currently I have to enter the expression as: 4 * ( 3 + 21 ); instead of: 4*(3+ 21). Another thing is this makes working with negative numbers slightly more difficult. I cannot enter: 3 * - 2 (no matter how I space it). Instead I have to enter any negative number as ( 0 - 2 ), which as you can imagine is very tedious. I want to be able to distinguish the numbers based on if there is an operator between them.

Just for curious.\n Here is my code\n ```cpp\n include <type_traits>\n include <iostream>\n constexpr int compute(int x) { if (std::is_constant_evaluated()) { return x * x; // Compile-time branch } else { return x + x; // Runtime branch } }\n int main() { int result {compute(5)}; std::cout << \"Result: \" << result << std::endl; return 0; } ```\n I noticed that the website said gcc with -O2 compiler option will evaluate a constexpr function which isn't required constant expression at compile time. So I use the -O2 option to make the compiler evaluate.\n I expected that the result would be 25 when the constexpr function was evaluated at compile time. However, it returns 10. Obviously, this function was evaluated at runtime. I don't know why this happens.

Mainly for my self at the moment, but Im considering if there would be market for the solution. My solution would be an desktop GUI app, as well as shipped with CLI available binary (for servers aka CI/CD).\n The protector would work as follows:\n  \nLoad your binary into the protector.\n Select the protection mechanisms out of available in the protector GUI.\n Optionally save protection presets for future use, or for CLI use as well.\n Export protected binary\n  \nThe protection features would be:\n  \nAnti-debuggers protection\n Strings obfuscations\n Import obfuscations\n Code flow / disassembly obfuscations\n Anti-VM protection\n On the fly License Manager (create/modify a user licensed by EMAIL + KEY or HWID)\n Binary size compression\n  \nThe protector itself would be fully cross-platform solution. Meaning that the GUI and CLI tool could run the same way on Windows, Linux and MacOS machines. So the Linux host can manage Windows, MacOS and Linux binaries and vice-versa.\n At the beginning I would support only Windows binary protection, meaning that the protection of Windows EXE and DLL only would be available at the beggining. No Linux ELF executables, and no MacOS Mach-Os - those would be added in the future.\n The protector will make your binary nearly impossible to crack or even nearly impossible to investigate whats inside (lets assume that you don't want anyone to see how the communication with your remote backend server is done on the client side, as an example).\n Does anyone would be interested of using such soft? If no please tell why. Are you using any solution that is currently available on the market? If yes, please tell me what can be done better.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/arubahook_xapak    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, going through the www.learncpp.com tutorial and am just a bit confused about these statements. I am totally new to C++ so I am very likely missing something.\n Firstly, as I understand it, modern inline functions are used for creating functions which, mostly likely by being included as header files, could be redefined again, and this is done to prevent errors (the One Definition Rule). Importantly, all of these definitions must be the same, or else undefined behaviour.,-The%20linker%20will) will result.\n Secondly, inline functions are used in header-only libraries because if they are redefined by the user in their code, there will be no compilation errors to to a violition of the ODR.\n Given all this, the problem seems to be that a user whom #includes a header with a certain function may then define their own function of the same name, which will result in a compilation error by violating ODR.\n What I don't get is that, if instead the header function was inline, the user defining a new function by the same name will probably have a different definition for the function, which will result in undefined behaviour. Surely it is preferable to have a compilation error alerting you to the problem (allowing you to just rename your function) than undefined behaviour at runtime?\n    submitted by    /u/PurpleAmmonia    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In my personal hobby project, which is of a medium-largish size for a single developer, I use copious amounts of templates. I don't use a large amount of concepts, but there are a few places where I have needed their functionality. A good example is CRTP base class calling a derrived class' method non-virtually, and only if that method exists -- in essence, implementing Golang's implicit interfaces, non-virtually.\n Since the beginning, I thought that concepts would increase compile-times, since template-related stuff generally does. However, I recently added a decent amount of concepts to an internal graph library. I have not noticed any type of compilation slowdown at all. Again, I don't have a ton of concept usage, but there is a non-trivial amount. I am pleasantly surprised.\n I'm using the latest MSVC 2022\n How are other people's experience with compilation speed when using concepts? \n    submitted by    /u/vulkanoid    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

As my experience grows, the performance and features grow each generation. My previous engine is a Vulkan renderer with an Actor programming module and hundreds of features, smart caching, its blazing fast and incredibly complex. The number of engineers that understand the engine is small. \n My latest client requires an educational rendering framework, its really simple to read and understand, basic features and simplistic caching, and lacks the \"squeeze the last drop of performance out of the code\" design. The number of engineers that can understand the code is high. \n I must confess that I'm enjoying working in the simpler code base more. It lacks complexity, but also has less features and performance. I'm beginning to question whether extra complexity is really worth the hassle. Of course, it all depends on the target project. \n There is a comic that shows the journey from beginner to expert to guru, and the guru code matches the beginer code.\n Any gurus on Reddit willing to share their experience on how they approach new dev projects after doing the beginner->expert->guru journey. Is simpler better? Or since the gurus have the know-how, do I continue pressing pedal to metal to gain a few extra percentage points performance (and make the beast scarier to maintain). \n    submitted by    /u/smallstepforman    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello\n I am trying to understand the way caching and prefetching works by playing around with a raspberry pi 3b.\n I have a piece of code which empties my cache and then traverses an array. To make a long story short, since the traversal of my array is linear (hence spatial locality) and almost nothing else is done besides traversing it (hence temporal locality), unless I get preempted, data should get cached. The fact that I traverse my array linearly implies that it is also very easy to predict what next data will be accessed allowing my CPU's prefetcher to do its job and therefor never experience cache misses. Yet, I still see consistent cache misses at every 64th byte (i.e. 16th index in the case of this experiment).\n Code: https://pastebin.com/raw/Mp85NDEW\n corresponding output: https://pastebin.com/raw/evXmggBf \n You'll see that the access times of 38, 54, 70, 86, 102 are high which is exactly 64 bytes apart every single time.\n I was wondering whether anybody would have some clues about why I am seeing these consistent misses at what corresponds to the end of a cache line?\n EDIT: prefetching is enabled at the hardware level\n    submitted by    /u/blueMarker2910    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Not sure whether this is more appropriate for r/cpp, but I thought I'd ask here first.\n I always use nullptr over NULL, for the reason that overload resolution with NULL can lead to surprising outcomes because it's an integer, and not a pointer. (also it's shiny and \"modern\", or it can be considered more idiomatic C++, I guess)\n So I'm working with a new team member who is not convinced. He thinks this reason is really obscure and that you will rarely, if ever, encounter a real life scenario where that reason comes into play. I couldn't come up with an organic scenario that could happen in real code, and to be honest - I don't think I've seen something like that in the wild.\n Would you insist on strictly using nullptr in your codebase? I keep seeing him use NULL in his pull requests and I'm starting to wonder if I should stop being the \"code police\" and give up on this battle.\n    submitted by    /u/SnooMemesjellies8458    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Generally speaking such systems are pretty infectious within a codebase so choosing wisely is quite valuable.

In that vein I was hoping to get some insight from people who have used the following libraries as to how they are once deployed; are there unexpected issues or benefits, any regrets; maybe it is rock-solid and doesn't get a second thought? \n  \nAbseil Status\n Boost LEAF\n {Boost,} Outcome\n tl::expected\n std::expected \n  \nWhile there are many differences between the above libraries it seems that perhaps the biggest, in API terms, is whether or not the error type is universal or not. absl::Status has a single error type for all possible errors, whereas the other libraries seem to take a bring-your-own approach. I'm more used to Abseil's approach and was curious about people's experience with writing their own. Do you write many error types and have to convert (perhaps noisily?) between them, do you end up with one big error type that you use most places, etc?

(https://www.vobarian.com/collisions/2dcollisions2.pdf)\n the first on is effective but not very interesting from a simulation perspective : it doesn't take collision energy in account.\n The second approach is way better but i can't find a way to handle collisions when the density is too important: this approach doesn't move the particle, it edit the speed vectors. in a sparse world, it works perfectly. When the world is dense ( of particles) the algorithm tends to push a particle inside another one : \n Particle A and B collides, so the algo changes the vector speed of the two particles, then the position is updated using real world physics. but it happens a lot that after this operation , partiicle A or B is now colliding with particle C. In this order it's not a problem because C will be processed afterwards. But if after collision between B and C one particle is inside or colliding with A, ill have exactly the opposite behavior : they are now attached or one is included in another one. \n I suppose this is a standard problem when you want to use real world physics and not just verlet. it had been adressed a lot of times i hope...\n Do you have any ressources on this subject ? i know how to use google.\n    submitted by    /u/Technical_Weight42    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi cpp community,\n I am a dev working on a huge cpp code base and I have never really used constexpr in my daily job as a cpp programmer. I think I understood the basic intent of constexpr and what it tries to tell the compiler in terms of optimization. However I often hesitate using constexpr since I don't really profile the runtime performance of single functions or the compilation times (with or without using it). In addition, I think that it often can't be used if you heavily use concepts like polymorphism and therefore may even extend the compilation time. \n TLDR: I want to use it more to optimize my runtime performance, but miss a clear guidline when it should be used. Due to my concerns regarding compile times, I wouldn't place it everywhere in the code. As a programmer: Maybe a static code analysis tool would be great that notifies me if it might be useful.

What I would like to do is create a collection of these structs that enforces the uniqueness of each member of each struct. In other words, within this collection, no two structs can have the same value for member A, member B, member C etc. \n Another key detail is that this collection needs to be created at the beginning of the program, but after that will not be modified. Whether this effects what solutions are available to me I'm not sure, but thought it worth mentioning.\n Does anyone have any suggestions for how to achieve this?

Model include a class World, a class Wordable and a class Particle\n World is just the dimensions of the world\n Wordable is a class object that is on the grid (the word), so this class manage forces, acceleration speed position and collision. Wordable is never instantiated, so this is an abstract or virtual class (if i understand correctly) Particle is one child class of Wordable , i have severals Wordable chidren because i can have different type of particle like a particle with a mass or not (photon for example), another particle class with other parameters (like TTL) and so on,\n For the coordinates system i use broadly a very simple struct Vec2D { float x; float y; auto get2D(return sf::Vector2f{x,y} -> sf::Vector2f; (get2D is used because i draw with SFML)\n i was wondering where to put this Struct ?\n at this time this struct is in particle.h. wordable.h include particle.h\n model.h include wordable.h \n mview.h include model.h \n main.cpp include mview. \n first i dont really like this because everything is included also where it's not used/ Second, if i have two or more derived classes of Wordable, i ll have to copy the struct definition in all derived classes, or create a new file with just the struct and include it in all derived classes.\n but it sounds tedious and i multiply definitions for nothing. \n What would be your strategy ? \n i'm a beginner, about 1 years of C++ but i have played a lot with classes in php and js in another life\n    submitted by    /u/Technical_Weight42    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Blend2D 0.11.1 has been released and regardless of the conservative version number the project is progressing and offering more features & optimizations than before.\n Blend2D started in 2015 as an experiment to use a JIT compiler for generating 2D pipelines. It was written for fun with no intention of releasing it. However, because of the excellent results it was indeed released in 2019 under Zlib license and tagged as Beta. The initial version only targeted X86 hardware in its JIT compiler, which was a serious limitation.\n Blend2D's development never stopped and during the years it got new features such as multi-threaded rendering, AVX2 & AVX-512 optimizations, dithered gradients, and even cherries such as SIMD-optimized TrueType font outlines decoding. However, the most important feature, which is AArch64 support, is now part of 0.11.1 release. It means out of box support for AArch64 based SoCs and Apple Silicon.\n Interestingly, the rendering performance is really great on Apple Silicon and in many cases it's even better against competing libraries than on X86 hardware. Results from running a Blend2D benchmarking tool on Apple M3 Pro hardware are available on the Performance page (https://blend2d.com/performance.html) together with AMD Ryzen 9 7950X dataset for comparison. Users can also run their own tests and visualize their results on the Performance page via a \"Custom Dataset\" functionality. The benchmarking tool now outputs JSON after all tests finish.\n Blend2D homepage: https://blend2d.com\n Blend2D fiddle: https://fiddle.blend2d.com\n    submitted by    /u/Asm2D    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

But, here's my rust implementation, which got 0ms runtime:\n ```rust use std::collections::HashMap;\n impl Solution { pub fn two_sum(nums: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> Vec<i32> { let mut comp = HashMap::with_capacity(nums.len());\n  for (i, &x) in nums.iter().enumera…",

          "description": "There are (at least) 2 properties of the Go compiler that I find fascinating, especially compared to other languages:\n  \nIt is blazingly fast\n Cross-compilation is incredibly easy and straightforward; as far as I know you can easily compile for any target platform (OS/architecture) on any other platform\n  \nMy confusion (and question) is, what is the secret sauce behind this? And then of course also, why don't other languages do this?\n For example, I have used Kotlin a lot professionally and (in my experience) its compiler is really slow (building a fresh project feels like that \"compiling!\" XCKD: https://xkcd.com/303/). It can easily take several seconds to compile what it needs to run a unit test, even in small apps. Even after just changing a few files, it can take up to a second to compile (all depending on hardware of course). My experience with Go is that compiling rarely takes multiple seconds (with small apps, several up to maybe 30 seconds with bigger apps that I've worked with) and after changing only a few files it's nearly instantaneous...\n On the other point, I have recently started writing some command line apps in Rust, but I primarily develop on MacOS (Apple Silicon) and want to run the apps on my Linux (hobby) server (AMD64). I found it non-trivial to set up the linker so that it worked as expected (especially compared to Go where you just set GOOS and GOARCH and you're set).\n I believe I have once seen a video where it was explained that Go code first compiles into a kind of Go-specific assembly, and then \"only\" needs to translate that assembly to each platform's assembly. I don't know if that's still the case, but if that makes it so easy and flexible, why aren't more programming languages doing that?\n    submitted by    /u/zldu  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to create websites that run more efficiently on cheap VPSs (serving a variety of individual customers). I'm hesitant to keep C++, Go, Rust. And started researching web development with Go (Although before that I tried a project with Swift using the Vapor framework to create an API for a project already running with PHP Laravel). After 6 months of experience with Go, several first products were created. Create 3 libraries: FluentSQL, FluentModel, and gFly (Laravel inspired web framework written in Go). I used gFly code base to create 2 websites for customers. I'm impressed with Go's performance, memory usage, and flexibility for basic and advanced website needs, as well as microservices deployments. I also tried using Wails to create a desktop application (Go+ReactJS) to create a manager for the MikroTik router. And create a few other small CLI utilities.

Now I'm closing 5-10 questions a day with a link to the New to Go pinned post.\n I appreciate those of you who try to answer such questions, but if you are one of those people, could I ask you instead to take a quick scan over the New to Go post and answering there instead of in one of the half-a-dozen daily posts on the topic? That will default to sorting by New.\n It helps me to be able to send people to the New to Go post with a straight face if their questions are indeed answered there.\n So if you're one of the people who has book recommendations, or opinions about web frameworks, or an idea for an open source project a new Go developer can contribute to, or any of the other questions we're seeing multiple times a day, please perhaps even copy & paste one of your recent answers into that thread.\n I would just ask that you look for a top-level thread to put it under that matches the question if possible.\n    submitted by    /u/jerf  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not dissing Rust here, but if you have a pure Go project, in order to use the SDK you will have to introduce CGO into your project to build and use the depending libraries.\n That is inconvenient at best at worst, you will have to drop support for certain architectures that you otherwise would.\n Not to mention an increase of ~130MB to your built image. That is more than inconvenient if you pride yourself on a slick image size.\n Because of that, External Secrets introduced a pull-through REST based API server that is deployed via helm and uses HTTPS to communicate with the main external-secrets service. It comes bundled together with external-secrets' helm chart, but it can also be installed separately.\n It provides TILT file for easy development and a way to quickly generate a certificate ESO can use for secure communication.\n It's in alpha at the moment, but I'm not planning on changing the REST API anymore. ( Unless there is really a good case for it. ).\n Here is the link https://github.com/external-secrets/bitwarden-sdk-server.\n And once this PR is merged external-secrets will support Bitwarden Secrets Manager.\n Thank you for the support and reading this!

There are quite a few encodings bundled in so be warned there is undoubtedly some uncovered edge-cases this early in its release.\n The package as an importable component does have some generic use for marshalling and unmarshalling between formats with a standardized interface.\n https://github.com/JFryy/qq/\n    submitted by    /u/SoggyVisualMuffin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For the past 8 years I was primary SRE/DevOps/Platform Engineer. I used various programming languages (Python, JS, TS, Groovy) but the most of the projects were small and the complexity came rather from poor architectural decisions (all in into serverless) rather from the business logic.\n I noticed that my programming muscles started to atrophy when I started writing a Terraform provider. I decided to shift away from SRE related work back towards developing software. Go was my choice because it fits the area where I am mostly active (cli, tooling and backend). I noticed that many devs from different ecosystems (Rust, Java, C++ etc.) scoff on golang for being too simple. I don't think that is really the case.\n For one, It took me a lot of time to familiarise with the Go's stdlib that is quite extensive. Writing idiomatic Go code is not that easy since the language is quite unique in many ways (concurrency, error handling, types, io.Reader and io.Writer). On top of that memory management is quite bizarre. I get the pointers without pointer arithmetic. I really enjoy all of this, I just think using it as intended is not that simple as some state outright.\n I get a little defensive because I am quite experienced engineer and It clearly took longer than expected to learn the Go. The language that supposed to be \"simple\" and to quote Rob Pike:\n  \nThe key point here is our programmers are Googlers, they’re not researchers. They’re typically, fairly young, fresh out of school, probably learned Java, maybe learned C or C++, probably learned Python. They’re not capable of understanding a brilliant language but we want to use them to build good software. So, the language that we give them has to be easy for them to understand and easy to adopt.\n  \nThat is a little condescending because it should be the logic/product to be complex and brilliant - not the programming language. It is like criticising a sculpturer for using a simple chizzle.\n    submitted by    /u/b1-88er  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instead of repeating the same things over and over and fixing the same mistakes (like forgetting to close a channel or check the context), we decided to create a small library. With the help of generics it is now a breeze to build steam processing pipelines. \n Use cases: \n  \nAPI requests: do N parallel requests and push the data for further processing\n DB queries: fetch data from database in one goroutine and process results in another.\n Processing messages in batches (e.g. from RabbitMQ)\n  \nKey Features:\n  \nConcurrency.\n Cancellation upon context cancellation or error.\n Small composable API.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/aspidima  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I would like to initiate a discussion about a software architecture case I am currently facing at the company I work for, and get your opinions on how I can improve the application's architecture.\n I built an application in Java 17, using Spring Boot 2.7, about 6 months ago. This application handles approximately 20k RPM, with an average response time of 60-80ms. As the initiative for which this application was proposed started generating a lot of money, the product team decided that this same functionality should be available in other parts of the main sales site. This change will cause the application to receive around 500k RPM in the coming months.\n This application does not involve any heavy processing; it only makes API calls to fetch delivery information and returns it. A significant part of the response time is due to waiting for other applications. With this increase in traffic, I am exploring how to improve its performance to avoid issues and reduce response time. We have a load balancer and instance scaling system that will manage the platform.\n I plan to upgrade the application to use Spring 3.2 and Java 21, so I can use Java's virtual threads to improve throughput, as we have some parallel calls.\n One of my colleagues suggested that we change the application from Java to Go, but I believe that in this case, we would not have significant gains, except for faster scaling. I think this because the application's workflow mainly involves waiting for responses from other APIs. What do you think about this? Would it be worth switching this application to Go? What gains would we have?\n Instance resources are not a problem because we use the smallest machine available on our platform, and even so, it has plenty of resources left over\n    submitted by    /u/SemFutur0  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In regards to the new 'iterators' coming in Go 1.23, I stumbled upon some blog posts and chatter on social media talking about how this is an unnecessary language change. I was somewhat aware of the proposal and thought the func(func(T)bool) bool was a bit odd but after seeing this, I started investigating further and contributing to the discussion on https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61897\n I've always thought channels are the obvious choice for representing iterators (as they represent a stream, queue or sequence of values), naturally I assumed there must be a good reason why the language had to change the spec in order to support iterators (instead of adding compiler optimisations for channels to support this, I've even gone into some detail on how this could be implemented efficiently).\n The reaction I've received, however, is bizarre? I've been told it's too late to comment on this, it's already been decided. That channels must not be used for this (technically they can be used as iterators). Instead Go is adding special case functions to the language spec and a special case package iter just to support the same language semantics as receive-only channels?\n I've always considered Go (and the community) to be very cautious about making languages changes, not to add duplicate ways of representing the same thing. Pushing a cohesive and simple design. I'm curious, is it just me feeling like there is a major shift in principles here and is there anybody else who has had a look at this and thought the built-in channels are the obvious answer here?\n    submitted by    /u/Splizard  \n [link]   [comments]",

These days, I can't provide good reasoning to my team for why we should use the OO approach(the approach example in the link) or just use plain functions without receivers.\n I see a lot of Go code using an OO approach, especially creation patterns like the Factory pattern, Builder pattern, and Singletons. There's a lot of encapsulation tied to structs and interfaces with methods in them. I understand that Go is not a fully OO language and uses a mixture of OO, functional, and imperative programming.\n But we seem very confused about which approach is the best. My vision is the following:\n  \nUsing certain OO creational patterns in packages.\n Using receivers in package functions where it makes sense and the rest is imperative.\n  \nCan the Go community tell me what is the golden middle?\n My manager wrote a package that contains just functions. My suggestion was that we should use the Factory pattern with a NewSomething() function that returns a struct.

I don't understand how the Java code differs from the Go code in satisfying this criterion of static interface/flexible implementation. They both look the same to me. In both cases the client defines an interface and the publisher (logic provider) implements some logic object conforming to that interface. In both cases, the main() function constructs a client object using the logic object and calls the `process' function defined by the logic object. What am I missing here?\n Java code:\n public interface Logic { String process(String data); } public class LogicImpl implements Logic { public String process(String data) { // business logic } } public class Client { private final Logic logic; // this type is the interface, not the implementation public Client(Logic logic) { this.logic = logic; } public void program() { // get data from somewhere this.logic.process(data); } } public static void main(String[] args) { Logic logic = new LogicImpl(); Client client = new Client(logic); client.program(); } \n Here's the Go implementation\n type LogicProvider struct {} func (lp LogicProvider) Process(data string) string { // business logic } type Logic interface { Process(data string) string } type Client struct{ L Logic } func(c Client) Program() { // get data from somewhere c.L.Process(data) } main() { c := Client{ L: LogicProvider{}, } c.Program() \n }\n    submitted by    /u/pakraaaw  \n [link]   [comments]",

I feel vibey about GCP, I think it has a chance to take off and being there as spec when it happens might boost mu career. AWS - when i look at the UI i want to cry, but truth to be told they have the biggest share in the market and it looks like safe bet job wise right now.

          "description": "There is a steady stream of posts about how hard it is to find Rust jobs, especially for those with little or no paid Rust experience. I'm currently in the prototype phase of a new project with a core component written in Rust. I estimate the effort to be around 500 - 600 hours and it would need someone who has pretty good Rust skills. I could structure it as a paid internship, part-time contract stretched out for half a year, or a shorter but full-time contract. For me it makes no difference as the money coming out of my pocket will be the same. \n But what do you think would be the best way to structure this from the job seeker's perspective? What would increase your chances for future Rust jobs? Or do you think it won't matter?\n Background to this question is that I do a lot of Unity/C# work and in that space, internships are very important. Many studios currently look for paid internship experience in their candidates. I recently hired someone for a two month full-time contract and they asked me to send them a letter saying it was an internship because they felt it was more valuable to them that way.\n    submitted by    /u/tag4424  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I recently discovered the takecell crate, which offers an incredibly useful synchronization primitive for moving a value through a shared reference across several threads. It's sort of the inverse of a OnceLock.\n While looking through the code, the usage of a Relaxed atomic memory ordering stood out to me though:\n rust match self.taken.swap(true, Ordering::Relaxed) { // The cell was previously taken true => None, // The cell wasn't takes before, so we can take it false => Some(unsafe { &mut *self.value.get() }), } \n The crate claims it's safe but I'm not convinced -- my understanding is that a Relaxed ordering is only valid when the value in the atomic is the only data that needs to be synchronized. Since this is using an atomic to synchronize access to an UnsafeCell I'm not sure that it's valid to allow the compiler to reorder memory accesses\n The code I'm referring to is here, I would greatly appreciate a second look here!\n    submitted by    /u/JoJoJet-  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I'm not familiar with Rust but I'm considering moving from C++ to Rust.\n IMO one big issue with C/C++ is that it allows \"non-const indirection\". What I mean is that if your struct has a pointer, you can change the memory pointed to, and since this does not change the struct instance itself, it is allowed to be declared as const. For example, a vector implementation could do the following:\n template<typename T> class Vec { private: T* m_buf; size_t m_size; size_t m_capacity; public: void set(size_t idx, T val) const { m_buf[idx] = std::move(val); } }; \n IMO this is very bad. You usually have the mentality of \"if something can be const, it should be\" but this goes against it. Worse when you are using API's that can be incorrectly labeled const on this behavior and you'll have to search if what you are calling does modify the memory owned.\n Does Rust prevent this?\n    submitted by    /u/Spirited-Victory246  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've recently been interested in branchless programming, and I was using u64::leading_zeros for an algorithm. However, I noticed on Godbolt than on x86 architecture, leading_zeros was compiled into bsf instruction, and because because bsf doesn't support zero, compiler has to add a test before and a conditional branching.\n I know that lzcnt exists now, and it can be enabled using -C target-feature=+lzcnt, as explained here, but that's not the subject of this post.\n So I've wrote a branchless version of `u64::leading_zeros*, that you can find on the playground. We can verify on Godbolt that there is no more branching.\n EDIT: as suggested in comment, the following version is simpler https://godbolt.org/z/1qYeG6cbo\n Obviously, I've no idea of the performance of this function just by looking at the assembly, and I don't really expect it to be faster; at least, performance should be consistent. However, I don't have an x86 architecture to bench it (Apple Silicon spotted), so I decided to write a Reddit post to ask if there are interested folks who would mind doing it and share the results 😬\n If I could, I would do a benchmark with multiple random numbers, to mess with CPU branch prediction, and also a benchmark with only one number, to (maybe) help the CPU.

And today I'm here to announce that version 0.2 is out, with a lot of new features, but the main one is that now headers are fully supported.\n you can check out the repo here: https://github.com/wllfaria/hac\n and here you can see a screenshot of how it is looking like at this point:\n preview of features on hac release v0.2.1\n My current focus is implementing environments, which is a highly requested feature, but expect many new things to come.\n if you like this I would really appreciate your star; Also I wanted to thank all of you that already starred and got it to 88 stars, that is actually crazy!

This crate provides an alternate implementation of the the std::any::Any dynamic typing mechanism that includes the support for non-'statictypes that is missing from the stdlib's version.\n repo - https://github.com/JRRudy1/transient\n docs - https://docs.rs/transient/0.1.1/transient\n To use this crate you implement the simple Transient trait for a type (derive macro included) which captures its transient behavior (i.e. lifetimes and variance), after which you can cast to the reimplemented dyn Any trait object and later downcast to the original concrete type. Implementing this trait is unsafe but straight-forward, and once implemented everything else is safely enforced using the type system.\n Notable features:\n  \nFully replicates the std::any module\n Near-identical API for 'static types with small changes for transient types\n Supports any number of generic type/lifetime/const parameters\n No external dependencies without feature-gates\n Includes a (feature-gated) derive macro for the Transient trait\n ProvidesTransient impls for many stdlib types\n Provides (feature-gated) Transient impls for some foreign types - feel free to request more!\n Extensive documentation including numerous examples\n Permissive MIT/APACHE-2.0 dual license\n  \nI decided to make this crate after running into the 'static-only limitation of the stdlib version on multiple occasions, such as when I wanted to erase the type of an ndarray::ArrayView<'v, T, D> to pass it through generic-forbidding code and ended up having to clone the data instead. If you have ever faced a situation like this (which I'll admit is fairly niche), then this is the crate for you!\n Let me know what you think!

It is suitable for general purpose graphics and compute on the GPU.\n Applications using wgpu run natively on Vulkan, Metal, DirectX 12, and OpenGL ES; and browsers via WebAssembly on WebGPU and WebGL2.\n  \nbut this (the description from wgpu homepage) is tripping me up. if wgpu serves the same purpose as opengl and vulkan, what does it mean for it to \"run\" on one of those? based on that description, presumably wgpu is more generic than opengl or vulkan, but if so, what can it actually do? and if one is trying to make an application that has graphics, would one only need wgpu? or would they need other stuff?\n furthermore, what do these libraries provide beyond just shaders? do they somehow make it easier to use them? if graphics are on the gpu, then why is there a non-shader interface at all? what does that provide?\n    submitted by    /u/Critical_Ad_8455  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since then, RMK envolves a loooooooooot. Now I'd happy to annouce that RMK hits v0.2.0, with a bunch of exciting new features.\n The following is a simple list of important updates from v0.1.0.\n  \nWireless support for nRF52 and esp32. RMK now supports BLE/USB dual mode with auto-switch feature\n A new configuration system based on toml. Now you can config almost everything of your keyboard with a single keyboard.toml, no Rust code is required! This makes RMK more user-friendly. If you want do more customization, you can still\n A new rapid debouncer, which would trigger the key first and then do debouncing\n Interrupt triggered matrix scanning, which reduces power consumption a lot\n Support more advanced keyboard feature: mouse key, media key and tap/hold feature\n Documentation and project-template got improved a lot\n  \nI also did some measurement about the performance and power consumption of RMK firmware. According to my testing on my nRF52840 GH60 board(open-sourced as rmk-ble-keyboard), the key latency of RMK is about 2 ms in wired mode and 10 ms in wireless(BLE) mode. The power consumption is about 200ua when advertising, 450ua when idling and 2ma when typing, which means RMK could provide about 2-3 months battery life with a 2000mah battery.\n In the duration of implementing RMK, I got lots of help from Rust community. The Rust community is so great. Also, the great tooling provided by Rust makes the dev experience quite pleasurable. Finally, I'm looking forward to more feedbacks about the project.

          "description": "Stronger question, why aren't any of the PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd and Ord traits (I would call them PEPO) unsafe?\n From the Rust Nomicon:\n  \nOn trait declarations, unsafe means that implementors of the trait must check the trait documentation to ensure their implementation maintains the contracts the trait requires.\n  \nThe PEPO traits have requirements which have to be upheld by implementors. Thus it would be natural for them to be unsafe, this is even suggested in the same chapter of the Nomicon. When the traits aren't marked as unsafe but have requirements unsafe code must assume the trait contracts don't always hold. I can also easily imagine a safe function implicitly relying on the reflexivity of Eq for example and thus behaving differently than it should, breaking it's own safe invariants.\n The reason behind not marking PEPO traits as unsafe is explained in the same chapter of the Nomicon:\n  \nThe decision of whether to mark a trait unsafe is an API design choice. A safe trait is easier to implement, but any unsafe code that relies on it must defend against incorrect behavior. Marking a trait unsafe shifts this responsibility to the implementor. Rust has traditionally avoided marking traits unsafe because it makes Unsafe Rust pervasive, which isn't desirable.\n  \nThis confuses me. How would marking the PEPO traits as unsafe make them harder to implement, when the trait contracts would be exactly the same and also, don't the benefits of marking the PEPO traits as unsafe outweigh the drawbacks?

          "description": "Hello Rustaceans\n I have been learning Rust and coming from Java I have to say it has been very refreshing.\n I just love the heavy use of sum types (enums) throughout the language, especially `Option` and `Result` that are far better than `null`s and exceptions. I like matching, I like macro that can sometimes feel like magic and others compile time control, I like that everything is immutable by default. The borrow checker forces me to understand the memory well which gives me a lot more confidence when mutating something (in Java, you don't own the object, and you don't know if some other part of the program holds a reference to it, so you're not very sure what part of the program would be affected by the mutation)\n However it seems to me that all the things that I love are the high level part of the language and the inspiration it took from functional programming.\n Sure I appreciate the language is very fast and that the same language can be used on bare metal, but it is not very useful to me, it never was a grievance to Java for me after all. The borrow checker can sometimes be annoying and although a high level language, it sometimes forces me to have low level considerations.\n The low level part although useful and interesting, is not very relevant to me, and I wonder what I could trade against this part of the language. In other words what could a high level only Rust look like? Could you make any suggestions of languages that can fit this description? I am thinking something with no nulls or exceptions, statically typed, with some emphasis on function purity, with algebraic data types and reasonably fast (something competitive to Java)\n I am thinking something like gleam, haskell or elm maybe but I would like to hear your thoughts and if you would take the trade-off.\n Thank you for reading me\n    submitted by    /u/Locarito  \n [link]   [comments]",

The main purpose of this crate is to allow you to defer handling individual Result::Errs and to group and nest arbitrary error types ergonomically, enabling you to return multiple error values from functions at the same time. Here's a link: https://crates.io/crates/lazy_errors\n I started learning Rust five years ago in my spare time. There is so much I love about the community and the ecosystem: The language is both nice to read and write, very expressive, and the community has documented extensively how to design good, idiomatic solutions. There are a lot of powerful crates that just feel natural. For example, thiserror and anyhow/eyre are just so fundamental to defining or handling errors …",

          "description": "Dear fellow Rustaceans,\n Arguably the most challenging part of being a programmer is internalizing a lot of details, sometimes implicit, about the codebase you're working with. It takes significant time, even for an experienced developer, to become fully autonomous on a new project.\n I've always wanted to find a way to ease this process of memorizing the codebase, and I have also been fascinated with large language models since first learning about them. As you already guessed, my pet project is a thing that utilizes the LLMs' language understanding to answer questions about the repo you are in. As seen on the screenshot, it first scans through the code with Tree Sitter to map out the interrelations among the symbols, after that it reads through the selected source files to understand them, and then it presents its conclusion to the user.\n The key point here is that by staying in the command-line interface you do not break context. You do not have to copy-paste anything anywhere, and the conversation just flows.\n Other good questions it may help you with:\n  \nDuring what period of time were we using a vulnerable version of a certain crate?\n Who are the top three committers?\n Is there a user-wide config?\n  \nI very much hope someone might find this helpful as well. Any feedback is welcome, both on the code, and on the looks and feels of it:\n https://github.com/xhjkl/well\n $ cargo install well\n screenshot of well in action\n    submitted by    /u/makarmakar  \n [link]   [comments]",

The rust_bridge exposes a series of macros and traits that can be implemented to translate vanilla Rust into py03, neon, and C compatible Rust. For those interested we have a writeup on How We Generate JavaScript and Python SDKs From Our Canonical Rust SDK. We recently added C into the rust_bridge and are working on interop with additional runtimes, like Go, JVM, and Beam.\n We wanted to thank the community for all the effort that gets put into OpenSource Rust and are hoping that our contributions will be helpful!\n Let us know if you have any questions, stay awesome. \n    submitted by    /u/smarvin2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As you should know, getting a reference (shared or exclusive) to a \"static mut\" will probably end up as a compile time error in 2024 edition.\n Like a lot of people, I use \"static mut\" for global state. I never really thought about why \"static mut\" is whacky.\n  \nIf my program is single thread, why do I need to synchronize the access of a \"static mut\" ? After all, no race condition can happen.\n \nWhy Rust force me to use \"unsafe\" to touch this \"static mut\" ?\n \n The reason is aliasing : if you use \"static mut\" in a way that end up with more than 1 exclusive reference, this is undefined behavior.\n The compiler assume only 1 exclusive reference to a memory location can exist at any point in time. \"static mut\" give you the power to get as many exclusive reference you want (by using \"unsafe\").\n Even if you think you can manage this, this can be very surprising and result in ugly code.\n 1st, you'll have to use \"unsafe\" at any time you touch the \"static mut\".\n 2nd, if you store an exclusive reference of the \"static mut\" on the stack (temporary or function argument), you can't have another one unless the first one lifetime end.\n 3rd, you'll have to shorten the lifetime yourself by using block {} or function call.\n 4th, even using a shared reference forbid you to have an exclusive reference somewhere.\n It's very easy to forgot you have already one reference of the \"static mut\" in-use inside your call-stack (upper), and the compiler doesn't say anything because all access of the \"static mut\" are gate behind \"unsafe\". The same problem happen in multi-thread with Mutex : if you have one lock in your call-stack, and you try to lock the same Mutex again, it's probably a deadlock. One could consider it's a programmer error and you should respect the invariant, I don't know what to say about that.\n What are your favorite alternative ? OnceCell, OnceLock. UnsafeCell, SyncUnsafeCell, RefCell, Arc<Mutex>, Rc<RefCell>, std::ptr::addr_of_mut! ?\n    submitted by    /u/Nzkx  \n [link]   [comments]",

This app would need some SQL stuff, not too much desktop integration.\n The main reason to no develop a simple web It's avoid using servers.\n Right now I'm good with typescript and react. Also python but I think it won't be useful for that.\n I don't know rust, but I don't mind to learn.\n \n My first thought was about electron, some apps I use are made with electron, it's widely used and fits my language knowledge, but, maybe it's a bit bloat, some of the apps I use are slow even for \"simple\" purposes. Also bundle size could be close to 200M for a simple text editor. Apps like VSCode are very optimized despite that, but I'm not Microsoft,\n So I saw Tauri, It looks great, even made my first \"hello world\" app in twenty minutes, but I cannot find serious projects using this technology.

This seems error prone.\n The second problem I have, in which I think I can solve with PowerShell, is I want the development packages to copy to a local feed after a build's execution.\n Lastly, I want to make sure all projects currently referencing any -dev tag references are removed before a commit can be merged.

Well, that dream is now one step closer to reality with OpenRecall.\n Inspired by Microsoft's controversial Recall tool, which was recently announced, I decided to create my own, slightly less creepy, version.\n OpenRecall runs quietly in the background, periodically capturing screenshots of your desktop and recording your activities for a configurable amount of time.These logs are stored locally on your machine and can currently be queried through a chat assistant to answer questions like \"What have I been doing from 3 to 5 PM?\" or \"Write my work logs for the day.\"\n While I plan to develop a web app to visualize these logs in the future, OpenRecall is currently available as a CLI tool. Beyond the initial concept, this tool has the potential to evolve into a proactive AI assistant, providing greater context about your activities and helping you achieve your goals more efficiently on your computer.\n Here is a quick video demo.\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMpka_E6_o8\n The project is open source, and you can check it out here: https://github.com/amir-halloul/OpenRecall\n Please don't be evil and use it for employee surveillance.

This got me thinking about how to reduce the risk of future developers adding default initializations to an object that needs to be mapped, thus increasing the chance of forgetting to copy properties when mapping object properties.\n To tackle this, I added an analyzer to enforce exhaustive initialization on a class (via an attribute). You can check out the repo and NuGet package here: [SubtleEngineering](https://github.com/ShaharPrishMSFT/SubtleEngineering).\n This tool will emit a warning if any of the properties on a class/record/struct/record struct are initialized by default. Note that there are some limitations, and that I may not be covering all cases. If you find an issue, let me know.\n There are two more analyzers in the package:\n  \nMandatory using: You can mark a method or type as RIIA (placing the [RequiresUsing] attribute on it) - from that point, any developer not instantiating the type or calling the method within a using() scope (or using modifier) will get a warning.\n Relative Import (using): Warn on specifying a relartive namepace in a using decleration.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/subtleengineering  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello :)\n a few weeks ago I presented my game framework here in the subreddit. Today I released another big update that I have been working on for the last few weeks.\n 3D Updates\n The biggest change is that it is now finally possible to use 3D animations. This has been a long requested feature, and I would say one of the most difficult, as it involves a lot of complexities that are difficult to debug.\n Another new feature is the ability to load other 3D formats. In the first release only wavefront files were possible. Now, with the help of Assimp, all common formats can be loaded quickly.\n Please note, however, that the engine still has some features in the 3D area that are still under development, such as shadows.\n 2D Updates\n But now we come to what the engine can already do very well: 2D. There are some new features here as well, such as the implementation of 2D lighting using Screenspace Lightmaps and a new game element, the NavMesh, which allows you to find your way using an A* algorithm, or the particle emitter.\n All in all the engine or rather the framework is developing in the right direction. My goal now is to create a community around the project and maybe find one or the other who wants to work on it, because I noticed that the 3D part can be very extensive. For this reason I have created a new website gfx-engine.org as well as a forum forum.gfx-engine.org.\n Here you find the projects github Andy16823/GFX: Simple 2D & 3D Game Framework with C# and OpenGL (github.com)\n I would be very happy to find the one or other person who wants to join the project.\n    submitted by    /u/Tiraqt  \n [link]   [comments]",

Would User B be able to decrypt the message successfully with a C# generated AES key and IV?\n Secondly, I was thinking of generating and storing both the key and IV myself within the application, but decided against that, as I felt it might make the app too vulnerable and that doesn't sound like the right way to do it.\n    submitted by    /u/Ima_Uzer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been working on finetuning/refining my BitLocker app in terms of achieving consistent speed (2 seconds is the goal) for the last week\n The problem I've been facing is that consistently, 1 out of every 10 runs (when the app is run) the \"Initializing BitLocker Manager\" step takes not less than 1 second but about 3-4 seconds and that greatly slows down my app from my perspective despite the GUI telling the user something along the lines of \"BitLocker PIN being changed...\" or sth like that\n But for the remaining 9 runs - give or take - the app always finishes within 2 seconds from start to finish which is fast enough for me\n This \"Initializing BitLocker Manager\" step consists of the filtering from all the fixed local physical hard disks, type 3. So only fixed local physical hard disks get queried in WMI to begin with. Network shares mapped as network drives in File Explorer don't get searched for to begin with, neither do removable physical disks such as USB pendrives etc, floppy disks etc etc \n Now the 1 improvement I've made is that now instead of querying all physical local hard disks, the app immediately queries the system hard disks type 3, so drive C.\n I have run the app about 5 times thus far, like this, looking for instances where the same issue of the querying taking 4 seconds not less than 1 occurs and have yet to encounter it but I'm kinda afraid I will\n Is it absolutely impossible, sometimes, to make WMI-based queries or operations consistent all the time? Is there nothing I can do about this sometimes?\n Edit: I just encountered this same issue again. Bummer\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Exchange_9646  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A couple of years ago I was introduced to the world of C#, specifically making basic native Windows apps in Winforms. When I started this project I decided to take it to the next level and use WPF, it was fairly easy to learn and more modern than Winforms. \n So this is how Stack Solver was born: an open-source app that optimizes the process of loading boxes on a pallet in the most efficient way. What distinguishes it from other similar apps are the modern, simple interface (shoutout to WPFUI), the ease of use, the ability to create 3D renderings of the result (again, one more advantage of WPF) and obviously the fact that it's free and open-source unlike the majority of software programs in the domain of logistics and warehouse management.\n I would appreciate any feedback and ideas for improvements. Github repo: https://github.com/VladM7/Stack-Solver\n PS: i know the code is messy because part of it was written when I wasn't that experienced in C#, but I am currently working to bring it to a more organized state.\n    submitted by    /u/mrvlady  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, I started with Scratch at 7, trying to learn the basic coding mindset. Then, I began working in Unity where I used C#. It took me some time, but eventually, I got the hang of it and finally felt confident enough to participate in a few game jams, where I created simple games based on a theme all alone within a time limit.\n A few months back, I wanted to explore more programming and decided to try something other than just Unity. So, I searched the net and found out that you can make basic console applications using .NET. It was a little weird getting used to a slightly different style of coding compared to working with Unity, but it was fine after a few days.\n After making basic things like calculators, turn-based combat, dice throws, tic-tac-toe, and shape calculators, I found that I had no idea where to continue and where I should go next. After watching some videos online, I wanted to try LeetCode, where I realized I have a shallow knowledge of data structures and algorithms.\n So, my question is, should I continue doing LeetCode problems and try to learn as much as I can, or should I make some other projects? If so, do you have any ideas or directions?\n Thanks for reading. I would appreciate it if you could leave your opinion.

So by calling bash I start a bash shell and then I provide the docker commands through StandardInput. But what I think is happening is that once the first command executes, bash does not detect that the first command completed/returned successfully.\n I know I can set the Arguments property in Process, and execute the first command, and then change Arguments to the second command and call p.Start(); again, but that would spawn two processes and I'm trying to avoid that.\n Is there any way to do this without having to call Process twice?\n    submitted by    /u/saponsky  \n [link]   [comments]",

The clients sends the server updates about their player (position, bullets and such) and the server pass those messages also to all the other clients. I have a List of ClientAtServer (object I created) that each interact with a different client. I have a method \"passToAll\" that passed the message the server recieved from one client to all the other clients (going in a for loop over the list and sending the message using their BinaryWriter). Each time I accept a client he is added to the list, and the opposite for the removal of a player. It shows me an error saying the collection (clients) was modified.

It's been a blast learning about web API, SignalR for real-time features, and all the fun bits in between.\n What's inside?\n  \nUser authentication & registration with Jwt tokens and user profiles.\n Posting photos with captions and hashtags.\n Liking & commenting on posts.\n Following & unfollowing users.\n Real-time direct messaging with SignalR.\n Notifications for likes, comments, and follows.\n Searching for users, posts, and hashtags.\n Even stories that disappear after a while!\n  \nInitially, I wanted to undertake a project focused on CRUD operations. My first thought was to clone Facebook using a microservices architecture, but that seemed like a massive undertaking for a junior developer. So, I decided to aim for a more manageable project—Instagram—using a clean architecture.\n Feedback and constructive criticism are welcome! You can check it on GitHub.

These include simple values like ints and bools, but also more complex Model objects.

I've been cramming so much study that the other day I looked at what I was trying to do and it was like hieroglyphics lol. I couldn't remember things I learned the day before. \n Anyway, I took an easy day and then when I got back to it, its like it started making sense again. Coding feels like magic when I'm learning. I'm creating something. Those little aha! moments as you press the green button and it all works are incredible! \n I kind of shot myself in the foot in the beginning because I was barely practicing. But since I've been ending every lesson with 2-3 mini projects its been going very well. I cant wait to see where all be in a month and going on! \n If you have any tip or advice for a newbie I would greatly appreciate it. My hardest sections are anything involving math. I can do it but I dread it lmao. I struggle with retaining what I learn to and would love to know some tips to deal with it.\n    submitted by    /u/SCrelics  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "All my developer journey I ignored endianness, thinking it was some kind of \"low-level protocols\".\n Now I want to figure out exactly what endianness affects.\n So, here are the conclusions I've come to:\n  \nBE:LE does NOT affects struct/class fields layout. If i declare type with two int fields - for structs ctor'ed in methods, they are positioned accordingly on stack, or for classes - on heap after VMT pointer (of course there can be some padding or optimisation from CLR, but in general - it is true).\n BE:LE does NOT affects bit order.\n In general BE:LE does NOT affects process' virtual adress space. Oversimplifying, if I run the same programm under ideal conditions on BE and LE computers, the memory snapshot will look the same, except for primitive object fields, but objects positions and their layouts whould be the \"same\".\n BE:LE does affects only primitive types, i.e. Int16-64, double, float, unsigned types, and especially >1byte chars. Bool and byte for example doesn't affected bc of 1byte, also decimal doesn't affected, bc it is composite type.\n  \nI need someone to confirm/disprove my statements, because I'm a bit confused, given that I've always drawn a picture in my head of bytes going from left to right.

These helper method was responsible for setting up additional setups on the mocks.\n This led me to some issues when running the tests afterwards, as the unit test that called the helper method added some setups on the mock, that caused other tests to fail.\n All tests run when running one by one, but some fails when all are running.\n I have been thinking about ways of solving this, but got stuck.\n Ideally, it would be great if I can setup a mock to only be valid ONCE.\n Or find a way to reset some specific mocks after every method call, but I haven't found a way of doing this.\n Any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/sponkae  \n [link]   [comments]",

In January, I switched to a CCTV company as a software developer, hoping to learn about backend technologies, computer networking, and software development. Initially, I built 2 or 3 components for their software, but for the past five months, I’ve been assigned tasks unrelated to coding, such as remotely fixing camera issues and manually testing software developed by a senior developer.\n Despite expressing my desire to focus on software development, my manager keeps postponing any coding tasks due to ongoing issues with the company’s software. This has hindered my confidence in coding since I only had three months of coding experience from my previous company. Additionally, when interviewers ask about projects I've worked on at my current company, I struggle because I haven't done any significant coding work here. My target is to get a job as a .NET developer.\n I need advice on what to include in my resume regarding my role in this company, which uses WPF .NET framework, while my skills are in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I joined with the hope of gaining backend knowledge and becoming a full-stack developer, but I haven’t received any coding tasks for the past five months.

I'm serializing the response from the JSON with System.Text.Json and it basically looks like this:\n { \"status\": \"ok\", <some other shit> \"data\": ... } \n Now, \"data\" can either be an object (\"data\": { \"ID\": \"1234\" }) when something is found or an empty array (\"data\": [] ) when not found.\n Basically, I have an ApiResponse<T> generic type where T is the type of the data. This doesn't work when the response is an empty array, so I made a custom JsonConverter for the property. However, those cannot be generic, so I'm at a loss here.

I'm running into an issue getting a core component of my app working in Blazor and was hoping some one a bit more experienced could help point me to the right path.\n In my app I have a virtualized grid of images. The image controls have a set width, with a clamped height. The image itself is then placed in that control and scales (aspect correct) to fill the control. The mage control grows to allow the image to take as much space as possible, clamping the height if the scale gets too big. The height of any given row is the height of the tallest item IN that row.\n I'm attempting to do this with a Virtualize control in Blazor …",

          "description": "I recently finished watching a great video from NDC on new .NET8 features and while the content and presentation was fantastic, the incessant code vomit from Copilot every time a character was typed was a huge distraction. At several points throughout the talk the presenters pause to consider whether or not what copilot suggested was intellible, or laugh at how wrong it was. Or worse still, recognise that while the suggested code seemed correct, it wasn't quite right due to a nuance. \n I have nothing against Copilot as a product and think it can serve as a valuable assistant for certain tasks, but please keep it out of all live coding / tutorial type content. As a seasoned .NET developer I can happily \"see through\" the prompts and focus on the actual intent of the presenters but I can imagine how jarring and disorienting it would be to newer developers trying to understand the concepts and follow code while the layout jumps all over the screen in unpredictable ways.\n I'm not sure if this is something that Microsoft is mandating that all of their presenters enable but it's really detracting from their otherwise fantastic content.\n    submitted by    /u/nom_de_kek  \n [link]   [comments]",

It was quite nice to work with, and I always had an idea to build something similar but for SQL (the system was actually using custom query language called FetchXML). Here is the reference to their concept - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.query.queryexpression?view=dataverse-sdk-latest\n So finally after some spare nights I've built this tiny library SQLQueryExpression NET - https://github.com/skinex/SqlQueryExpression.NET At the moment, this library is quite basic, it could handle SELECTS, WHERE conditions (nested conditions as well) JOINS (LEFT and INNER) as well as UNION and EXCEPT ALL. I do have a plans to add support for queries listed in Not Supported Queries section at some point.\n If you find this library or perhaps this approach interesting, feel free to give it a try, report any issues or contribute to the current codebase :)\n PS: I'm aware that this library is not nearly as powerful as EF Core (or even EF), or SQLKata, it's just demonstrates a way of writing queries in object oriented manner. I'm also don't really want to debate about functional vs object oriented way of building queries, I'm pretty sure everyone has very strong opinions on this matter, but it wasn't a point of this tool to prove anything regarding this topic.\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/namethinker  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've never done C# and I was mainly front end with JavaScript for some enterprise applications for the first year and a half. I wanted to do back end development since I was more proficient with front end and have never explored back end development at the job at all.\n This past March, I made an appointment to see both the manager and tech lead and asked if they have back end projects where I can learn and contribute to the team. They were delighted to set me up with a Microsoft & Pluralsight training program and follow through the lessons. Fast forward, I was recently assigned with a project using Entity Framework to create some repositories and boy I have never been stumped on an assignment, ever. My Imposter syndrome was creeping up at times and I felt defeated not knowing what to do.\n The team and tech lead who has way more experience in Entity Framework were very helpful every time I ran to a problem. I asked what I could do outside of work to improve my C# skills and they suggested Pluralsight foundations and Microsoft's C# documentation, which are helpful. I bought C# Player's guide a while back that I'm currently working through after work and it seems very helpful.\n It was the best decision of my (career) life because I felt that I was not progressing as a software engineer and was doing simple front end assignments. Backend is a whole different world. I'm currently getting my behind kicked doing Entity Framework but I'm learning so much about C#, the framework, and what I need to work on. If anyone else felt like they are not progressing, ask you manager to see what you could do that is more challenging or an area where you don't have expertise in and learn.\n    submitted by    /u/foureyeddriver  \n [link]   [comments]",

My plan is not to become a C# master but to at least know the necessary to produce things.\n Do you have any tips? How can I get the grasps as fast as possible? Have you ever done something like that? Is it even possible if I create a crazy good learning schedule?\n    submitted by    /u/Seapotato17  \n [link]   [comments]",

After seeing how code is done in the real world from my internship, doing some small exercises from the C# player's guide and thinking about how I would structure my first (small) game project I realized I have no idea how I would structure even a small project.\n I know there is no right answer and it involves a lot of nuance and abstract thinking but as the question above says, how do I decide on when a csproj needs to be split up? how do I decide from the get go what functionality can be grouped into an existing project or if I need to create a new project for it? How do I know if im being too granular and splitting things into too many projects. \n I realize this a design pattern type question but I havent gotten that far yet in my course work and would appreciate some guidance in the right direction.

However, I'm running into issues with it that I don't know how to handle. Consider this code :\n  internal class Foo { private FooObject currentObject; public FooObject CurrentObject { get => currentObject; private set { currentObject = value; } } public Foo() { CurrentObject = new FooObject(); } } \n This code gives the \"warning CS8618: Non-nullable field 'currentObject' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor. Consider declaring the field as nullable.\"\n As far as I understand though, currentObject is set through the CurrentObject setter (Setter kept simple for brevity, assume it needs to be custom to do some other stuff).\n Now my question is, is the warning valid for some reason that is escaping me? If not, how would I go around making it go away without disabling the warning entirely?

Define the classes in both the API and the ClientLib\n Duplicate code (not per se a bad thing), but there is more room for error. Fixing a bug in the API DTO and forgetting to change the library or something like that.\n 2. Define the classes in the ClientLib, and let the API include the ClientLib\n This would remove the duplicity, but feels wrong. The client should not be the owner of the DTO's, but the API. \n 3. Define the classes in the API and include the API in the ClientLib\n Would make the whole ClientLib bloated with code it doesn't need.\n 4. Create a seperate Library with the DTO's, which get included in both the API and the ClientLib\n Feels like a lot of extra complexity for such a small problem.\n Currently we've gone with Number 1. Sure some duplicate code, but it's a total seperation of concerns. And each DTO can have some utility functions specifically for the API or Client.\n I guess I'm not the only one working with API and Clients this way, so really interested in how others solve this \"problem\". \n    submitted by    /u/MrCorba  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello reddit, I’ve built a global serverless API gateway which handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, monitoring transformations etc.\n It’s entirely built on top of C# and .NET8 and uses the Microsoft Reverse Proxy (https://github.com/microsoft/reverse-proxy) at it’s core, for proxying the requests. It’s also inspired by the .NET architecture, with the notion of routes and middlewares and comes with a nice interface to configure everything in minutes (no code required).\n There are three main concepts:\n  \nRoutes - paths that define different operations in your API (can be with dynamic, optional or catch-all parameters). It uses the .NET route matching for processing requests.\n Backends - a cluster of endpoints where the requests will be proxied to\n Middlewares - functions that are executed in a specific order in Routify edge proxies and define how requests are processed. These are similar as the .NET middlewares and policies approach. You can have global middlewares in app level that apply to all routes or you can have route specific middlewares. You can also disable a specific app middleware or you can disable all app middlewares in a specific route.\n  \nSo far, it has processed 100+ million requests and works very fast (.NET8 is amazing). The average processing time for route matching and middleware processing is ~1ms (this does not include the network operations when proxying the requests).\n Routify makes it easier to manage and secure public APIs. It's distributed across many regions globally and acts as a proxy between your clients and your services.\n You can use it as a reverse proxy, as a gateway between your APIs in different cloud providers, as a geo load balancer or simply as a monitoring tool for all requests going through your API.\n For those interested, Routify is in public beta and freee to use at https://routify.to\n Check it out and let me know if you have any feedback or question. I’m happy to answer them.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/RoutifyTo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have used Entity Framework for some project in the past, both with .net framework and .net core, in database first and code first version. \n Coming to the conclusion that it is more disadvantages than advantages, while it makes my life easier on the other hand it introduces other problems , e.g. hard to write queries, read in linq. Excessive uncontrolled reads on the db and various headaches caused by unexpected engine behavior.\n After shelving Ef for years in favor of dapper (I got along very well with Dapper there is I used it for many projects), I continued to use entity only to generate filtered queries automatically . \n Now I have to start a new very complex project and am writing the framework to be reused for various sub projects. I am adopting Ef code first, convinced by colleagues, however I keep thinking it will be a source of problems more than a real advantage and various limitations and difficulties are emerging already in the first tests where we are forced to use raw sql for partial updates in the la unit of work. \n So I would like to use dapper and/or sugarsql on all queries at least at the framework level.\n Also considering that what I used to write with ef 7 years ago is pretty much to trash and what I wrote with dapper is fully functional , I think that ef in the long run its not the right choice.\n What is your experience with ef/dapper/sugar sql? What do you think of my reasoning?\n Thanks \n    submitted by    /u/xil987  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Considering a “Windows tweaking” program to do a few things that many other Windows-castration apps don’t seem to be doing. But I haven’t exactly done a Windows program before, at least in terms of an executable program that can be run in portable format, and possibly even installed (in some future version) for scheduled monitoring.\n In general, when dealing with Windows internals for purely Win10 and Win11, would you preferentially reach for a DotNet Framework or a DotNet Core setup?\n Looking for reasoning. My background is mainly in Enterprise-level CRUD Intranet apps for companies, which would run locally on their network from a server. So it’s not like I have oodles of experience creating programs for the desktop. I know Framework is on it’s way out, but I have also heard that it still has superior third-party resources for Windows-specific capabilities and needs.\n The vast majority of the app’s functionality will be in modifying the registry in a safe/programmatic way, and running specific PowerShell commands. Depending on requirements, some may be isolated as vertical slice components, others may have a shared “applying engine” against which instructions can be run. This will be protected behind a very simple checkbox-based or slider-button-based UI.\n Final note: this will NOT be released through the Windows Store, as I highly doubt it would ever get approved there. Straight download only. I also intend this to have a more traditional Windows-like UI, and a standard *.exe binary with no external files except for text-based “sanity/changes-implemented references” that are filename-locked to whatever system they were generated against, in case the executable ends up on a USB stick or network share to be applied to multiple systems.\n    submitted by    /u/rekabis  \n [link]   [comments]",

The program has a Customer class, Plan class, and Note class, with most functions tied to the Customer class.\n I'm adding a feature to calculate remaining hours in a plan, where hours are recorded in the notes. I see two options: 1. Add these functions to the already large Customer class. 2. Calculate total hours in the Note class and then pass this to the Plan class to compute remaining hours.\n Should I follow the existing pattern and add functions to the Customer class?

          "description": "So my app is semi-finished, it already does what it has to, when I have more time I'll improve the GUI or some other stuff about it.\n The problem is that I've noticed during my completely amateur testing that there's times it takes it 5 seconds to change the BitLocker PIN and export the key, sometimes only 2. Usually only 2 seconds but even that isn't fast enough for me. \n When I had this app completely in powershell, I accepted it being due to the fact it was in powershell. Interpreted is going to be slow compared to compiled\n But this one is entirely WMI-based, no powershell, no cmdline arguements, just C# using WMI calls. And it's compiled. \n So I'm looking for ways to make my app faster. Ideally it'd take it 1 second - no more - to delete the current TPMAndPin protector, delete the current Numerical Password, change the TpmAndPin protector to the user's input and then export the auto-generated Numerical Password to the given location\n As I said, sometimes this takes 2 seconds, sometimes 4-5. Ideal time would be 1 second.\n I'd go for asynchronous but in this case these things have to happen in this specific order. If the TpmAndPin isn't deleted before a new one is created, the new one won't be created because the system cannot contain more than 1 TpmAndPin protector.\n Can I get some help with this?

(github.com)\n How it Works ?\n Terminator defines a method called UnProtectAndTerminate that aims to terminate a specified process after removing its protection. It utilizes platform invoke to call functions from system DLLs. First, it imports functions from ntdll.dll and kernel32.dll. These functions are NtSetInformationProcess to alter process information and TerminateProcess to forcibly terminate a process. Within the UnProtectAndTerminate method, it enters debug mode using Process.EnterDebugMode(). Then it attempts to open the target process using OpenProcess, passing necessary parameters including the process ID. Afterward, it calls NtSetInformationProcess with appropriate arguments to remove the process protection. If successful, it terminates the process using TerminateProcess with an exit code of 0. \n Why was this tool made ?\n I developed this tool specifically designed to terminate processes containing the RtlSetProcessIsCritical feature, after encountering several malware samples utilizing this technique during my analysis.\n    submitted by    /u/Temporary_Hope_7198  \n [link]   [comments]",

At page 211, the author recommends not to resolve scoped or transient services directly from the root DI container, because can lead to \"leaking of memory\".\n  \nWARNING Don’t resolve scoped or transient services directly from WebApplication.Services.\n This approach can lead to leaking of memory, as the objects are kept alive till the app exits and aren’t garbage-collected.\n  \nBut for scoped services, you cannot resolve a scoped service without having a scope, you need to create a scope first! And even if you forget to dispose the scope, it will eventually go garbage collected and disposed. How can a memory leak be produced?\n For transient services, you cannot have a memory leak, because that's how transient services work, an instance is created every time, the container does not keep an instance to it.\n Next, another recommendation which is confusing:\n  \nInstead, you should only resolve scoped and transient services from an active scope.\n  \nAlways resolve transient services from an active scope!? What does scope have to do with transient services?\n Although I am senior engineer myself, I wanted to ask a clarification further, here that's why I posted it here.\n DISCLAIMER: My goal here is not to try call out the book or the author in any way!!!

However, I always receive a 401 Unauthorized response when the app is run on Android. The same (401 Unauthorized) response occurs when I try to call it with Postman or Insomnia.\n I use web services with the OData V4 URL for the queries, and the username is used for authentication in BC.

Something I did so far was defining an update model and everything that is not null will be updated to a value. This only works for data that can't explicitly be set to null.

How can I enhance my SQL? How can I use this to handle the moving of x different files based on these rules and so on. I want to solve problems quickly, and with little hassle.

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n I've recently put significant effort into enhancing my library for generating fluent builders and I believe it has now matured enough to be applied to most use cases. Fluent builders are very convenient but writing them can be tedious. The idea of this library is to generate the builder class from attributes on the properties and methods of the class to be built. The latest updates include\n  \nSupport for generics and partial classes\n Enabling of optional builder methods\n Branching capabilities\n Support for returning arbitrary types\n  \nIf you're new to this library, you may find the storybook helpful. It explains the library step by step and provides a comprehensive overview of its features. You can find a link to the storybook, as well as additional examples, in the readme on GitHub.\n To illustrate the usefulness of the library, you can have a look at the diagrams in this excellent blog post by Mitesh. The fluent API described in the post can be crafted in about 5 minutes using the library. An implementation can be found in the comments of the blog post, as well as in the example project included with the library.\n Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions. If you would like to get some input on how to use the library in your use case, please create a GitHub issue with the label `design help request` and you will receive timely feedback.\n Happy Coding!,\n Kevin\n    submitted by    /u/kmschaal2  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a very potato laptop but i can surf web and run basic softwares. \n I wanted to make a pixel art game for a long time. I got the inspirations from Stardew Valley, Thimbleweed Park, Undertale, Celest, Iconoclast. I have Aseprite for pixel art sprites and google a little bit for coding for a game and decided C Sharp is good enough for making simple games. I want my game to run good under potato specs so you can play it any device anywhere.\n I have ideas for a simple bracelet game to make. I have ideas for RPG game. I also have probably an hour or three a day to spend on this hobby project. That includes learning c sharp, learning pixel art/drawing (I also dont know that) and making the game. I also picked godot engine for the game development. It is free and open source and that's all i want.\n I dont know if i am aiming to high or if this is achievable at all. I am planning for a deadline at all. if it takes 10 years so be it. As long as i am satisfied with every bit of the game and art i am okay with it. I am making a post beacause i need advice or suggesttion for my goals. I dont want to learn or do wrong things and reliase later that all of that was for nothing.\n For learning i have bought a cource or udemy (it was cheap) and for pixel art i have anothe cource (I got for free) if you have any other resource or forum or subreddit for beginner c sharp programming and pixel art games that would be helpfull as well.\n    submitted by    /u/jerry_hpkns  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm returning to C# after around 7 years of not working with it, and seeing that we now have stricter nullability checks makes me very happy. However, I'm having trouble using them when fields are initialized in a method called by a framework or a game engine, such as Godot or Unity. Example:\n #nullable enable // Example 1 - I will set _graphics in the Godot editor UI, // and I want the game to crash if I don't. [Export] private Sprite2D? _graphics; private Sprite2D? _someOtherSprite; private Set<Node2D>? _setOfThings; public override void _Ready() { // Example 2 - _Ready is guaranteed to be called once, // before any other method from this class is called. _someOtherSprite = GetNode<Sprite2D>(\"SomeNode\"); } public void MyMethod() { // I want both these fields to be considered non-null here. _graphics.Scale = _someOtherSprite.Scale; _graphics.DoSomething(); // I still want strict null checks for everything else. if (_setOfThings != null) _setOfThings.Add(_graphics); } \n Ideally I'd like a field or property to be excluded from nullability checking if it is initialized in _Ready, or if _Ready has an assertion like ThrowIfNull(_graphics) for that field.\n Is this currently possible in C#, given that these variables are not initialized in the constructor? If not, what are some workarounds I can use to exclude some fields from nullability checking?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/smthamazing  \n [link]   [comments]",

Albeit, at the startup scale level.\n NB2: Also, and I think this is important, I do have experience working in Large companies in the past (8 years in Finance for large companies) so I understand things like office culture, social dynamics, bureaucracy, networking etc. My question is more about programming and the technical of doing so at an enterprise level. \n I am in the UK.\n    submitted by    /u/JayVinn21  \n [link]   [comments]",

My LAN is on the 192.168.1.? subnet and my VPN server puts me on the 10.8.0.? subnet. So the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 in both cases\n So if I understand correctly even tho I can access and ping my NAS when I'm connected over VPN, the reason why my app is still not working over VPN is because I'm not the 192.168.1.? subnet? Instead I'm put on the 10.8.0.6 subnet?\n Edit: I have the Synology DS118 and OpenVPN running on it (server) and the GUI client (community) on my laptops, desktops.\n Edit2: My self-made app maps all the user's network drives as local drives persistently in File Explorer.\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Exchange_9646  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can access it as a span so it’s quite easy to use it without allocating a byte array.\n I’d like to create an IPv4Address type using this same approach, mostly for the same “parse, don’t validate” and the fact that since it’s 4 bytes it will be (very slightly) more performant.\n But mostly I’m just curious about what others may have used InlineArray for?\n    submitted by    /u/Forward_Dark_7305  \n [link]   [comments]",

To better customize command-line along with some basic features like syntax highlighliting and autocomplete suggestions or something like that.\n Currently it only supports windows.\n I would be really happy if anyone can rip apart the code and give me some feedback on the project. I'm open for all criticism.\n  \nNOTE: I once posted about it from my another account and it did got a lot of well deserved criticism, specially on its README so I've spent some time (not longer than I would like to admit) to rewrite the README.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/SrijSriv211  \n [link]   [comments]",

Both attempts to receive UDP packets from an external device.\n Here's code (cannot be simpler)\n ``` using System; using System.Net; using System.Net.Sockets; using System.Text;\n class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { int listenPort = 4005; string broadcaster = \"192.168.0.88\";\n  using (UdpClient listener = new UdpClient(listenPort)) { IPEndPoint groupEP = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(broadcaster), listenPort); try { Console.WriteLine($\"Listening for UDP broadcasts from {broadcaster} on port {listenPort}\"); while (true) { byte[] bytes = listener.Receive(ref groupEP); string receivedData = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytes, 0, bytes.Length); Console.WriteLine($\"Received broadcast from {groupEP} : {receivedData}\"); } } catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine(e.ToString()); } } } \n } ```\n When I debug in dotnet6 it all works as intended. In .NET framework it simply waits for messages and nothing happens. It's the same if I run it in 'release', even from executable. I was running the code on Windows 10 x64 machine.\n But actually the code is intended to run on Windows7 Embedded (x86) device. What's irritating, any of the codes (not dotnet6 nor .net framework) works on that...\n Do you happen to have any ideas what may be the reason of such weird behavior? Where should I search for problems?\n Thanks in advance. yngwie\n    submitted by    /u/yngwieHero  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm sure they're worth the money but I can't spare that much, unfortunately.\n I found a bunch of tutorials online but I'm not sure which one to follow, they all seem decent enough.\n I found two videos on freeCodeCamp.org's channel, one being a 4 hour course for beginners and the other being an 8 hour long full course with mini projects and an identically titled video by CoffeNCode, but they seem to be two separate videos.

I'm not sure how to tackle the problem of authenticating my users to both clients. A user can login using same account on both apps.\n I have some requirements that have to be met and some problems:\n  \nI don't to use an external identity provider like Auth0 or Firebase. I want to store user credentials in my own database. I have no problem with writing some password-hashing code myself.\n Native login: I don't want to open a browser window in my mobile app or redirect to another page in SPA, so I don't use OAuth\n Use cookies for the web app and Header-Authorization for the mobile app? It is considered insecure using localStorage for authentication tokens in SPAs\n Session management: I tend to use Server-Side-Sessions that are stored in the database. Users in the mobile app stay logged in infinitely, users in the web app should be logged out after 30 days of inactivity.\n How to pass the session ID to the mobile app if we can't use cookies the same way as in the Web app? Should we transmit it in the body JSON? Should the API check for a authentication token in both locations (Cookie and Header)\n Session rotation: When someone signs in, the server-side session token is generated and stored in the database, until it expires or the user logs out. Do I need some kind of rotation for this token?\n  \nWhat would you recommend? Do you have any examples for this use case or any libraries that I might use?\n Thanks a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/Loris156  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "https://openjdk.org/jeps/8316779 introduces the concept of null-restricted types.\n I was wondering; why does this JEP have to be coupled with the Valhalla project? Can't it be delivered independently, much earlier?\n The JEP effort is described as XL, but as I read through the description I note that the vast majority of the complexity comes from introducing the concept of zero instances, implicit constructors, heap flattening, atomic read/writes, etc.\n None of these concepts seem to be a hard requirement for null-restricted types. In fact, the vast majority of them seem to be implementation-level details that are specific to Valhalla. They can be introduced later on if necessary. \n Couldn't we reduce the scope of the JEP by moving these concepts into the Valhalla JEP, and delivering this feature as a compile-time syntactic sugar?\n The benefit of introducing null-restricted types to Java is rather large, and the risk of releasing it as a preview feature without these other concepts seems to be low. So why not do it?\n With respect to these other concepts, we could introduce a compile-time check preventing null-restricted types from being accessed before they are initialized. We already do this for superclass fields and local variables. Developers are used to this concept. This eliminates the need for zero instances and implicit constructors.\n Nothing prevents us from removing this restriction when/if we decide to add these concepts at a later time. Though, I honestly don't understand why we would want to introduce these concepts when we could simply deny access to uninitialized variables. It seems much easier to implement and understand.\n I know that the language designers are a very smart bunch of people, so I must be missing something... What am I missing? 😀\n    submitted by    /u/cowwoc  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have several references to the `okhttp` dependency in various pom.xml files in my repo, all of them specify version 4.12.0 but for some reason, my builds keep downloading the old version (4.9.3). My only guess is that some other library that I'm using also uses okhttp but I can't tell which one. I could be completely wrong about that too.\n I've been digging through POMs and releases on Maven Central, in the okhttp GitHub repo. I've also been fiddling with `jdeps` and `mvn dependency:tree`. I have been tearing my hair out over this one. . . any help is appreciated.\n EDIT: I should also add that my project uses Java 1.8 and I cannot change that unfortunately (because all of the original developers are gone and I do not have the time/resources to upgrade to a newer JDK).\n    submitted by    /u/tech_tuna  \n [link]   [comments]",

First and foremost, I apologize for any ignorance or nativity throughout this post, I’m still a teenager in college and do appreciate the infinite wealth of knowledge I lack.\n I have written a decent amount of Java years ago (within the scope of Minecraft) so I’m syntactically comfortable and have a decent understand of the more common interworkings of the language, but these days I do most of my work (backend, mainly) with Golang.\n I’m curious, are new systems even being built with Java anymore, like does the language have life outside of necessity of maintaining older software? I understand that much of its edge came from its portability, but now that I can containerize a NodeJS server and deploy it just about anywhere, what is the point?\n This isn’t coming from a perspective of arguing the language is “dead” (as stupid of an expression as that is) rather I genuinely want to be educated by actual Java programmers to what the longevity of the language will look like going forward.\n TLDR: Why build with Java when there are much faster alternatives?\n Have a great day!\n    submitted by    /u/Beamxrtvv  \n [link]   [comments]",

He is also depending on some plugins to deploy React and Maven together which I would like to avoid so I don't depend on someone updating their plugin when new version of Java/React comes out and something changes.\n Maybe this is not hard thing to do, but I have basically zero experience in configuring project in this kind of way.\n Any advice is welcome\n    submitted by    /u/TurbulentMonitor1300  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Got accepted to Georgia Tech for CS/CE this year as well as UT Knoxville which is my state flagship. Didn’t get any aid, but after some scholarships, a degree from GT would’ve been a little over double the cost of UTK (~200k vs ~80k). Fortunately, my parents saved 100k for my college fund, making UTK essentially free and GT about 100k. \n Everyone around me gave me conflicting opinions. I carefully thought about the decision and now I’m going to UTK in the fall. I would consider myself somewhat intelligent, but I feel like I basically flipped a coin, even after hours of ruminating. You can make justifications for either school given the current state of the job market, so it was extremely tough. By far, I would’ve preferred going to GT, but 100k in debt is no joke. \n Over the summer, I’ve wondered if I made the right decision. I “played it safe,” in a sense, against my gut intuition and desires. Sure, if you’re smart and hardworking, you can succeed anywhere, but did I just throw away a massive opportunity in my hands? It’s eating at me inside. \n    submitted by    /u/Cartevyeboy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Easy work. The only thing that prompted my job search was that it was an in office position 5 days a week. \n I landed an opportunity in the private sector that would be fully remote and about a 20% salary increase. The people seem nice, and the tech stack is similar to what I’m currently using.\n I handed in my notice ready to part ways with my current employer when they asked if there was anything they can do to make me stay. I told them it would take a lot and how I value remote work. \n To my surprise, my current employer came back with a 15% higher salary than my other offer, with the option to work fully remote. They also offered me some training options as well as a pathway I could follow to continue my career growth.\n My current employer has been very good to me, and I have 0 complaints outside of being stuck in an office 5 days a week (which I knew what I was getting into at the time). \n Would I be stupid to accept the counter offer with my current employer?

Because the time I spent in this sub, it seems like a lot of you work for faang-level companies in high cost-of-living areas where demand for good developers is a lot higher.

There’s also little to no evidence of a single interest rate drop for the rest of this year. High interest rates for a long time. \n Job listings are the lowest in years: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE\n Was the Covid demand unprecedented? Yes. That market was unsustainable. However, labor supply has just increased, and doesn’t show many signs of stopping. If job listings are going to be the same amount as 2019, that would normally be fine, if the labor supply didn’t also explode to the moon. \n CS is still one of the most popular majors in college:\n https://www.coursera.org/articles/most-popular-college-majors#\n “The popularity of computer and information sciences saw 8.7 percent growth year-over-year, the highest of all the majors on this list.”\n I’ve seen people on this sub saying everyone is overreacting. Now do I think tech is going to be done forever and we’ll all be unemployed? No.\n However, there are loads of experienced engineers out there struggling to find work. Salaries have dropped, that’s a fact. Tech is extremely unstable. Even if you do get hired, who knows if you’re next in the chopping block? \n People are rightfully worried. A lot of people have been laid off and been having trouble finding work.\n The cost of living these days is insane. If you can’t find work in a few months you’ll be forced to take an out of industry job in most circumstances. \n It just annoys me when engineers on this sub with stable employment (likely work a government job or dodged layoffs) complain that this sub is too doomer and such. There are engineers probably better than you that are struggling to find work.

But I constantly hear that only a small amount of things which we learn in any CS degree is actually useful for job prospects. Companies really don't need stuff from an employee which is impractical and doesn't the do the actual job. People also say unis really don't teach the things which recruiters look for in a candidate to hand over him a job. Those skills are outside of the curriculum of uni and students need to learn those by themselves. So my question: What are these skills that I have to learn on my own to stand apart? I want to grasp them right at the beginning of my CS journey. Ofcourse I know that it depends upon the company a candidate will apply to but I think there must be some sort of standardization.

I took a break after school during the summer which lasted until winter, where I built one large project and other smaller ones.\n I quickly realized when I started to apply in January that jobs are not easy to come by, as all of you are well aware. I've submitted around 250-300 applications now and have yet to find a single interview. I had one phone screening that went well thanks to a referral, but unfortunately they filled the role the day after my screening so I didn't progress.\n I'm struggling to find a single interview. It's a numbers game (my resume has been iterated and I can't find ways to significantly improve it. Again, showcases education, experience, projects, and is consistent/formatted. the typical stuff. Could certainly be improved though I'm sure since I'm stuck getting interviews, but I don't know what significant stuff I can add in the meanwhile)\n The problem I'm having is figuring out what to do in the inbetween. I have no idea when I'll get a job. It might be a year, maybe two years. It's not out of the question with how dead this hunt has been. I'm working on projects on the side which have been better now more than ever, but it's not enough. I feel as though I'm wasting precious moments.\n I'm considering a masters, purely to put something on my resume as it's been a year since I graduated, and the gap only grows with time. Unfortunately, I missed the target application date for this term, so the earliest I can start is January 2025 for only a few programs.\n Does anyone have any tips on things to do in the inbetween to ease the mental stress of the clock ticking away?\n EDIT:\n Resume: https://imgur.com/a/7OANrkA\n    submitted by    /u/Craedyth  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I used to work at Bloomberg in their \"AI group\". I was hired as a \"research engineer\". Some people were doing some actual ML work but a ton of people weren't doing anything even close to ML. The weird part was that they were pretending they were. They would go to top-tier ML conferences and conduct ML interviews and have reading groups but their actual role was nothing ML-related at all. For myself I was working on maintaining DB clusters the whole time - I asked to do ML work but they wouldn't let me (I don't think there was any for me to do). The team I was on did nothing ML-related but had \"AI\" in its name. It felt like a big LARP. Fortunately I eventually moved on to a better place but I'm curious how normal this is.

Just the recent example, but I lost count of similar threads and mindset. A lot of posts on like r/antiwork gives of the same feeling. \n Stuff I commonly see is(and to be clear, its not one person saying/doing all this):\n  \nI don't need to be friends with people at work because I have other friends\n \nNever drink more than 2 beers then you will say stupid things and get fired the next day. \n \nJust go but leave early because... i don't know\n \nWhy would I ever want to hang out with people I don't know\n \nI don't go to events not duiring office hours because not paid(and no company will ever have a party from like 14-18 lol so what a ultra weird take)\n \nPeople are older/not same education as me/different office/something so it's 0 benefit for me even talking to them\n \nmore stuff...\n \n With that said, I do not mean one should sink 25 beers each company event and stay until 0400 and be expected to talk with 50 people each event. But you know, some common sense is just missing. In my experience for example, the people who work in IT or sales are the best drinkers, and this \"only 2 beers\" mentality I literally never seen. and as another post said, its who you know not what you know after a certain level and what you can be remembered as\n yes you can be someone who dont like alcohol or whatever because addiction, that's fine it's not those guys I mean\n Where do you think all of this is coming from?

I sent my offer letter to a school friend who I recommended through an internship program when we were discussing wages, and that friend ended up getting a job offer as well. He was upset that his offer was lower than what I was given, so he sent the recruiter a message about it showing the offer I sent him. I was fired a week later for sharing the info and breaking some policy and what not. \n I ended up getting a job at a warehouse for a furniture store in the meantime because I didn't qualify for unemployment. While working there, I spent the next two months sending out applications everyday like everyone else does. In those two months, I had 15 companies respond back to me wanting a phone screening, hackerrank test, or a straight up interview: responses that got my foot in the door. I had some rough interviews at first but continued to learn from each one of them until I recieved a job offer on June 4th. \n For anyone with a similar background, I graduated college with a BS in CS at the end of 2022, and I only have a year and a half experience outside of college. I also have 3 software dev internships throughout college. Though, I've never coded outside of school/work so I don't have a portfolio or personal projects to show. \n Even though it only lasted two months, I still went through the normal worries and anxiety that most of you have felt or are currently going through. Just remember to keep your head up and to not let yourself feel defeated. Your hard work will come to fruition. There's a light at the end of the tunnel. Whatever cheesey, cliche phrase you need to tell yourself, do it and keep moving forward!\n    submitted by    /u/The1NonlyMalohi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm a Dec 2021 grad who was fortunate enough to get 2 offers within weeks of each other. It feels kinda ironic because I couldn't get anything for so long after graduating, but I just stuck to improving myself as an engineer and as a candidate, and I guess it paid off.\n The problem is I already started the job I got first - I really like the team (friendly and strong culture of respecting wlb) and the pay is very decent (~100k), but the stack is fairly niche (think like Laravel/RoR). It's also not a brand name company.\n On the other hand, the second offer is with a well known tech company with a good reputation for wlb, and ~150k TC. The team also seems more high-achieving (a lot of US masters and past top tech experience vs career switchers, not that that actually determines the quality of engineer) so maybe I would be able to learn more and make my resume look better.\n Just based on the math, 50%+ increase in pay seems like a no-brainer, but I feel like I would really be letting my team down by leaving so soon after joining, and because I spent so long unemployed, I guess I kinda built some imposter syndrome where I feel afraid I wouldn't be able to deliver if I switch to the second company. But I also don't want my sense of loyalty to a company result in me missing out on a big opportunity, since if it helped their bottom line, I know the company wouldn't hesitate to cut me.\n I would really appreciate hearing everyone's thoughts and advice. Especially on how I should break the news to my current team\n    submitted by    /u/LongtimeLurker886  \n [link]   [comments]",

To make matters worse, I was working for a small company that was slow to adopt new tech so even in 2019 my skills were relatively dated. I spent most of my time writing SQL (Microsoft), developing reports in SQL Server Reporting Services and writing simple CRUD apps in C#.\n All of the jobs I see that mention those skills are also looking for a laundry list of other things that I have zero experience with (data science, web dev, etc.). I'm not sure where (or if) my job skills fit anywhere in the current market, if I'll need to start from scratch, or if I could possibly get some MS certs and find something similar.

Anyways, the recruiter just told me that \"entry-level CS knowledge would suffice\"\n So after talking about myself for 5-10 minutes, the director of engineering said \"are you ready for the technical part of the interview\"\n Me: \"Sure\"\n Him: \"Don't worry we don't like to have candidates stress. We just want someone that is motivated and willing to learn.\"\n Me: \"Awesome, that sounds great.\"\n Him: \"Okay, now I want you to \"clap\" when the right answer is read aloud, okay?\"\n Me: \"Okay\" *thinking, okay did I hear that right? That's strange*\n Him: \"First question. Which tool is used for styling a webpage? A.) HTML, B.) Javascript, C.) Django, or D.) CSS\"\n Me: *claps when I hear CSS*\n Him: \"Great!

You're one of the best candidates we've had so far!\"\n Me: *trying not to laugh* \"thank you!\"\n So basically, yeah the interview was just that for like, 10 minutes (the questions were legit mostly that easy, yes, with a couple questions asking what a particular paradigm or basic python function might do). \n So yeah, has anyone ever had a clap-along interview before or just me?\n    submitted by    /u/OutrageousPressure6  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been here for 3 years and admittedly haven't been doing well for most of my time here.\n My manager has been hot and cold with my quarterly reviews - one review he'll say I'm doing better and improving at a great pace, and another he's giving me what is essentially a PIP. I know I should've tried to leave sooner but I was stubborn and genuinely thought I could improve. I find the code base difficult to understand and navigate, but thought that with enough time it would eventually click. I'm not a lazy worker, I put out good work but my manager says I'm not fast enough with it.\n Recently he approached me basically telling me I'm on the verge of losing my job. He's already in touch with HR about it. I'm on some accommodations for health issues so he said they won't let me go right away, but that upper management is \"looking for a small team of high performers\". I have no idea if anybody else is going through the same thing as me. At this rate I don't expect to have my job by next month or so. It feels as though no matter how hard I try, it doesn't make a difference. I'm heartbroken because this whole ordeal left me feeling like maybe I'm just not cut out to be a good engineer/programmer.\n I've been looking for other positions internally for my level, but those are hard to come by, are usually for other countries, and receive literally thousands of applications, so I haven't even been able to get a single interview after at least two months of looking.\n I love working here and ideally I would like to stay. But I already have two \"PIPs\" on my record. So getting an internal position feels impossible. And with the way the industry is right now, I'm afraid of being without a job for a long time to come.\n What are my options? What would you do in my position?

About 6 months in, someone else on my team quit and I got hit with all their work instead, and all my deliverables got pushed back.\n The work is completely unrelated to my past experience/education. I don’t know what im doing. If you took away all my experience, put me in a 3 week Java bootcamp, then put me in this role right now, it would be the exact same experience. My manager expected me to be done with this work within a couple weeks. Its been 2 months and ive barely made progress. I had a 1:1 with him today and was on the verge of tears.\n Right now I just want to quit and go to another job so bad. I feel so lost and don’t have the slightest idea what im doing. I need some sort of advice as to what I should do to salvage this situation\n Update for those interested: I had a meeting with my manager and essentially told him everything I felt and what I needed for success. It went a lot better than I thought, and he essentially told me that the suffering part is inevitable for me to learn, and its fine that my deliverables are going longer than expected.

My linear algebra is a bit rusty but I am familiar enough that I think I could get back on the horse in a few months.\n I guess I want some feedback on whether my age rules me out of transitioning to CS at a level that would be comparable to my existing career path in IB. \n edit: thank you all for your input and wisdom. my takeaway is that I should stick to my current career path (which I don't mind) but pursue cs as a side hobby to the extent that I am able to continue teaching myself.

The CEO of PointsYeah has accused me of scraping their website, a claim that is entirely baseless (I have my GitHub commits, my code never interacted with his site). I hadn't even heard of PointsYeah until about a month ago, when I stumbled upon a mention in a Reddit post, Despite this, I received a message threatening to shut down my site (see message screenshot).\n Last night, our website was bombarded with an unusual amount of traffic, which seemed like a deliberate attack, and I've been receiving calls from random international numbers. I even found MilesLife - his previous company having payments issues with merchants - I will not comment anything on that, you are free to explore.\n I’m feeling quite overwhelmed by this, especially since this project was meant to be a positive addition to my learning and future opportunities. I've worked hard to create something useful and educational, not just for myself but for a broader community.\n Has anyone here experienced something similar? How did you handle it? Any advice on how to manage these accusations and protect my project?\n    submitted by    /u/Which_Extension_9576  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I just passed the final round of interviews for a company where the posted salary range is above my actual market value (176-220k, whereas my market value is actually about 150k, if that). I've never actually been in a situation like this so I have no clue how to approach the topic of compensation in my next meeting with the hiring manager. What should I even be asking for? It doesn't seem right to just ask for the lowest amount, but I have no clue how to justify to them anything higher. My current situation to be justified at the moment is: VHCOL area (northern LA), married with no kids but wife can't work, and 4 years of general SWE experience with two degrees from a top 5 university, and the field is gen AI which I've been working in for a year now. How would you proceed in this situation?\n Edit: Just to be clear, I got my \"market value\" of $150k by looking at websites like Levels.fyi and Blind, along with just what I've been generally seeing on job listings on LinkedIn, Indeed etc. I've been looking for 3-4 months now so I've seen A LOT of JDs. That being said, I am also looking only for remote jobs which may be skewing it to be a bit lower. This salary range of 176k+ is definitely above average. I don't think I'm selling myself short.

          "description": "I've been developing since the 2000s. In the good old days, most SDEs seemed to follow a simple rule that worked well for everyone: if you don't need an answer right away or just conveying information, send an email; if you do need a quick response, send an instant message. That way, I could answer emails all at once, on my own time (usually a couple times a day). I'd only get a DM maybe every couple days \n Sometime in the late 2010s, things seemed to shift, where people just used Slack for all communications. So, in any given day, I'll get several DMs throughout the day or tags, and constantly have to divert attention from focusing on coding to respond or at least decide if it needs immediate attention. It's more difficult to focus, and I find sometimes I want to log off from Slack for several hours, even if that risks missing an actual important message.\n Anyway, what I'm saying is, make email popular again. Is it just me who's noticing this?\n EDIT: See a lot of suggestions to disable notifications, but I'm not sure it's feasible. Because there are infrequent occasions where something really is more urgent. I guess the issue isn't so much Slack vs email (Slack has its advantages), but rather there's no distinction in Slack on message priority.\n    submitted by    /u/forbidden-donut  \n [link]   [comments]",

But with my new job I'm running several teams for 3 product lines that include front and back end. However the main issue is, as above, I do less than 5% coding per day. The rest is just solid meetings, fleshing out Jira tickets or architecture design stuff.\n I know it's a pointless metric to worry about but I can't help but get a slight bit of anxiety that I'm deskilling and losing the tricks of my trade that got me to where I am. Is this common for a jump like this? My initial Googling all points to wildly different answers, which I suspect will be voiced the same here.

I'm the lmost senior developer/engineer currently in the role of Infrastructure Architect (and unofficially, but throughout the company acknowledged, Tech Lead but we don't really use that term, my current title implies it), worked there for almost 3 years with 7 years experience in the field, almost from the start, worked for the founders other company until I made the switch) and put up with a lot of stuff along the way, high pressure, lots of overtime and the usual startop stuff that executives/founders normally Recently we hired a DevOps engineer who I manage, his experience is in junior/medior roles and his career spans about 5 years. Today our HR added proper structure to our HRIS so now we can view salaries of those we manage, so I can now see the salary of my new hire. I found this to be more than 1.5x my salary while he pays only 30% tax under the special Dutch law for highly skilled foreign workers. I do a lot of hiring but im'm not involved in salary negotiations, I know I don't make the most because I work at a startup and know I can easily earn at least double at other (probably corporate) companies, I have won awards and completed in/won numerous competitions with fantastic results.\n I'm not alright with this, it feels like a stab in the back after all my loyalty and the stress and even marriage tension. I'm unsure of how to pick this up with management and what this could mean for my career. I really like the company and the culture but this crosses a line for me.\n I'm clueless on how to handle this, I don't want to cause harm to the company by leaving, because that would cause some major, business continuity disrupting damage.\n    submitted by    /u/TheAnarchoX  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Not everyone loves what they do for a career and that's OK. There's nothing that says you need to love what you do in order to be a good engineer. Choosing a career because you want to make money is a perfectly fine reason to pursue something.\n Most skilled engineers aren't working personal projects day in and day out because they love coding. Turns out you can make tons of money and be super successful while not caring much for the field in general.\n \"The best software engineers are the ones that are passionate\". Hard disagree. The best engineers are the ones that invest the most time into improving. Whether or not you 'love coding' is irrelevant. You can invest just as much time into something because you know you will make a lot of money in the end.\n Edit: Some people are misunderstanding what I am saying. Not being passionate does not mean hating what you do. I am talking about people who make CS their identity, and then look down/talk down to anyone who brings up the fact that they are doing it because it is a well paying career.

Figured why weigh myself down more with another 200 job applications this month when I still won’t have a job regardless (slight cynicism but only slight). Fast forward to now: needed money somehow so now I repair engines. I don’t remember the last time I even coded something. \n This used to be my passion since middle school and an integral part of who I was. Weird to see me not even think about it anymore. \n I wouldn’t say I’ve totally given up… but I almost wish I didn’t get my masters so I could have gotten a real SWE job a few years ago with ease and have actual work experience so getting a job right now wouldn’t be impossible.\n Thoughts?\n (This message obviously contains some elements of slight exaggeration)\n EDIT: I don’t need “dont give up just keep trying” comments. I am aware of that. I will do so, but not at this time. I am not going to feel guilt about taking a few months off from the process of sending out hundreds of applications per month with a 99.9% rejection rate, or at least not right now I’m not. I’m burned out from doing this for a year straight. If you suggest that I will fail in my career in CS because of this then you are seriously misunderstanding the sentiment of this post. I’m not giving up on my career.\n EDIT2: thank you all for your wide variety of responses and the thoughtfulness you have put into them. I won’t retype all my replies here but I have concluded that I need to try other things than brute force spamming job applications for only SWE/web dev jobs and try to get anything to get my foot in the door + critique and revise my resume according to professional advice.

I had picked up a job back in march at a small insurance agency to develop a CRM lead management system for the company. The reason I picked up the job was to gain experience. I am the sole developer at my job and I am not going to lie I am gaining a lot of hands on experience primarily with Node.js, React, Azure, Git, REST APIs and a bunch of other things I cant remember to list. I report directly to the agency owner who is non technical, he likes my work and constantly tells me how smart I am but I feel as though he doesn't know what he is doing sometimes. He expects a single college student to build a CRM for his agency with no guidance from a senior engineer. I believe I am doing good work at this job and he thinks im pretty good too but I feel as though he is rushing me constantly asking me for updates on the project and setting deadlines for his employees to start using the CRM by this month. I have never had anyone use software written by me before so I am unsure of how this will pan out and I don't want to be responsible for such a big project in his business. Also I feel like for the amount of responsibility I have I shouldn't be getting paid 15 an hour and due to the fact that I am graduating soon I don't see myself staying here any much longer as 15 an hour wont cut it. When he initially hired me he promised that I can move up in the company and become a manager and that there would be a pay increase.

          "description": "Advice to all my current CS majors now, if you are in classes please don’t use CoPilot or ChatGPT to write your assignments. You will learn nothing, and have no idea why things are working. Reading the answers versus thinking it through and implementing them will have a way different impacts on your learning. The amount of posts I see on this sub stating that “I’m cooked and don’t know how to program” are way too high. It’s definitely tempting knowing that the answer to my simple class assignment can be there in 5 seconds, but it will halt all your progress. Even googling the answer or going to stack overflow is a better option as the code provided will not be perfectly tailored to your question, therefore you will have to learn something. The issue is your assignment is generally a standalone and basic, but when you get a job likely you will not be working on a standalone project and more likely to be helping with legacy code. Knowing how to code will be soooo much more useful then trying to force a puzzle piece an AI thinks should work into your old production code base. The problem is you might get the puzzle piece to fit but if it brakes something you will have little to no idea how to fix it or explain it to your co-workers. Please take the time to learn the basics, your future self and future co-workers will thank you. \n Side note : If you think AI is going to take over the world so what’s the point in learning this, please switch majors before you graduate. If you’re not planning to learn, you’re just wasting your own time and money. \n    submitted by    /u/connorjpg  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have heard of people graduating from Harvard, etc who couldn't get a job in the States and had to come back to their home country and teach English. \n Pretty sure that most international CS majors, even those from top schools, won't even be able to secure an internship and even if they do, they won't be able to get a job after graduation and even if they make through it all, only an extremely small minority will be able to get a h1b and then green card and stay in the States.

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n I just wanted to make a post to see if anyone could relate to me, and if so, has any advice or just share their experience. Just graduated from a top 10 CS school, >3.5 GPA, two internships (one Fortune 500), U.S. Citizen, and hiring freeze led to no return offer. 200 total applications, all rejections. It really crushed me to make it to a round 6 and then get rejected, thats just brutal. Been desperately scrambling. \n This week, I got a 80k IT indian consulting firm job. I know this market is tough, and this is a solid starting salary with everything that's going on. \n Unfortunately, I can't help but feel angry at myself when I see my peers at Google and equivalents, making 6 figures. Some of these people used to make fun of me for struggling so hard in Computer Science. Still I persevered. I think back to my sleepless nights all the way back to high school, dozens of AP classes, all hoping for it to work out in the end, and just feel regret. I wish I didn't stress myself into depression to end up with this result.\n I don't want to see ungrateful, but I am struggling with these feelings and feeling lonely in it. At least amongst my own network, I don't know anyone who landed in the spot that I did who did not have below a 3.0 GPA and no internships. I just wanted to reach out and see if there's any other academically oriented CS grads who are in the same boat. I feel like I had an amazing opportunity at this school that I totally fumbled. Maybe I didn't spend enough time on leetcode. Maybe I could have attended more career events. Pushed a little harder in classes I got a B in. I guess it doesn't matter now.\n    submitted by    /u/Fit_Ganache2504  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "During my second semester in college, I completely disregarded academics, and my college situation is now very bad. I barely passed a few of my classes, and for some, I have nothing done.\n Instead of studying, I focused entirely on coding. I would stay up nights coding, wake up at 3 pm, having slept through all my lectures, and then go back to coding. This was my routine throughout the second semester. I find coding very fun, and I posted everything I wrote on my GitHub, which ended up being really helpful in finding a job. My plan was not to land a job like this, I just enjoyed doing it, and at a certain point I had a feeling. I don't go to college, I don't have a job, I'm achieving nothing doing this, so I decided to go after a job. I saw that many places had a minum of a bachelors degree and the other jobs were just some internships, which I applied for. After some time, I got an offer to go for a \"try-out\" at a very big company, of course I accepted.\n In the interview, the HR manager didn't ask me any coding questions; we just talked about what my job would be like and even commented on my GitHub projects. I got through the \"testing\" phase, which lasted a few months but felt really quick. After that, I received a raise and a long-term spot on the team. Despite this, I don't feel very accomplished or excited because of my college situation.\n I'm attending college to land a job in software engineering, but I managed to do that early in my college journey. Now, I will probably have to retake the second semester or just move forward with the academic debt. I want to be happy, but failing college is a big hit for me, especially since my dad didn't finish college and wants me to at least finish it. That puts a lot of pressure on me.\n I think the best move here is to hold on to this job as long as I can to gain job experience for when I need to find a new job in the future.\n    submitted by    /u/Fragrant_Treacle_348  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "(New account so HR can't identify me)\n Recently started an internship at a big tech (not FAANG but everyone would know the name) and yes, I went to search for all Linkedin profiles of other interns asa I had their names in the gc. Here's what I found:\n  \nDiversity: 60% are males. 40% white, 20% Asian, 15% black and mixed. I'm not good at telling Hispanic/Latin but at least 2 of them are. \n \nDegree: 20% Master (actually surprised me), 5-6 PhDs.\n \nPrestige: actually 50-50 between T20s (both general and CS) and \"smaller\" schools. Most are still T100 or famous liberal arts, only 2 schools I have never heard of. \n \nExperience: Here's the part I found the most interesting. For T20 kids it's pretty varied between ex-FAANG and no previous internship at all. I don't count competitions or short programs at a company. I can't find Github or personal websites for half of no experience ones so no comment on their personal projects.\n \n For others, however, everyone (yes) had at least one internship. I also count internships at other countries which I assume are home countries of international students. 90% has Github/personal websites with all more than 2 personal projects. Again not sure if I couldn't find the rest 10% or they just don't have it.\n What does this mean? Probably nothing at all. And I'm sure not companies have the same statistics. Why do I post this? Well I want to share my 4-hour \"research\" with someone but don't want my friends to judge me. \n But as a non-T20 student, I want to show that your school names won't stop you from landing big companies. However, you do have a higher bar to pass to be equivalent to prestige school kids. Again, just from my small sample size observation.\n P/s: All the numbers are rounded to the nearest 5%. There are 2-3 interns I couldn't find their Linkedin so I didn't included them. \n P/s 2: Want to do international students but no idea how to identify it.\n    submitted by    /u/AppointmentWeird2547  \n [link]   [comments]",

The following Monday I got an email from the startup that I was interviewing for that I have been selected for an internship. Even though I am looking for full-time I was a relieved a bit because I can have some more time to find fill time or even convert the above internship into full time since they did mention about the possibility of converting. I was getting responses from the CEO for my queries about the compensation, joining date, etc('will get back to you soon about it') but now he seems to have ghosted.\n Until now I have given 3 interviews including a FAANG only to get rejected in the final rounds. All my friends have a job they are moving away while I'm the only one left.\n I don't know what is wrong. The last company said I had many strong qualities but a few that they were looking for is missing. As an international student I only have two months i.e till August and I am worried a lot. \n I have been working so hard, day and night not being able to sleep so that I can give my all for the assignments and interviews only to be rejected.\n It hurts like hell and I feel so lost. Every time I don't get an offer letter after the final round I feel that I have lost everything and now I have to start from scratch. It is physically and mentally exhausting.\n Not only that but it hurts to see my parents work hard to provide me the money to stay here. I can't do it anymore. I don't know how to survive this.

Since then I have been applying to jobs left and right(1300+ jobs applied). However I have not been getting any interviews. I have a summer internship on my resume and have completed a few projects in IOS Development, ML and AI. I have also gotten accepted into OMSCS at Georgia Tech and will be starting in August.\n Since January I have been sitting at home-upskilling and applying to jobs. Now it has been 6 months and I have found no luck with my job applications. Therefore in order to payup my bills and student loan I have been searching for jobs nearby and got a shift leader position at Tacobell. Now even though I am not shy of working hard at a fast food place, I am feeling pity on myself as I did not get a job offer from my field. I feel like I am the problem and not skilled enough for the companies to hire me and I am worried about getting entry into the job market? I wanted to ask on this reddit community a few question:\n  \nShould I take the job at Tacobell and how should I be positive about it?\n Should I get more experience thought internships and coop? And do you have any good resources to find this internships/coops for Fall 2024.\n How can I improve my job application and get a better chance at landing an interview? Any certifications or any other skill that I should learn.\n What direction should I move forward with?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Brave_Indication_293  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello Reddit community,\n I'm a computer science student reaching out during a challenging time. I created a project, FlyMile pro, a flight search engine that finds flights on credit card points. Originally designed to enhance my resume and secure internships, it surprisingly attracted over 10,000 sign-ups!\n However, recently, I've been facing some distressing challenges. The CEO of PointsYeah has accused me of scraping their website, a claim that is entirely baseless (I have my GitHub commits, my code never interacted with his site). I hadn't even heard of PointsYeah until about a month ago, when I stumbled upon a mention in a Reddit post, Despite this, I received a message threatening to shut down my site (see message screenshot).\n Last night, our website was bombarded with an unusual amount of traffic, which seemed like a deliberate attack, and I've been receiving calls from random international numbers. I even found MilesLife - his previous company having payments issues with merchants - I will not comment anything on that, you are free to explore.\n I’m feeling quite overwhelmed by this, especially since this project was meant to be a positive addition to my learning and future opportunities. I've worked hard to create something useful and educational, not just for myself but for a broader community.\n Has anyone here experienced something similar? How did you handle it? Any advice on how to manage these accusations and protect my project?\n https://preview.redd.it/xwe6vmic7j5d1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=06f324a23cdd294172ace537a9d9003124e6d32e\n    submitted by    /u/Which_Extension_9576  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know my experiences can probably be a lot better, but i don’t know how to get a worthwhile experience if all my resume gets rejected. The only other reason i can think of is probably the fact that I’m on an F1 visa, and that I’m not very good at networking.\n I’m working to fix the latter over this summer but I wish that recruiters could put more weight on my existing experience and GPA, since right now it just feels like I’m trying extra for something pointless.\n    submitted by    /u/Orbital_RM  \n [link]   [comments]",

He told me he's disappointed. I went and cried, I'm feeling so so bad that he's telling me now that my internship is about to end.

          "description": "In my Game Boy Emulator, I was able to get much higher audio quality by implementing audio syncing. My emulator has two audio queues, one for the left channel and one for the right channel. It will continue running until both queues get to 512 samples. At that point, the emulator will briefly pause, and with Javascript I create a AudioBufferSourceNode that uses data from both queues, and then I play it. I hook into the ended event of the source node, so that when it's finished playing the samples, I resume the emulator.\n While this helped, I'm still hearing some subtle crackly audio in the background. It's not always obvious, but it is there. I thought about it and I'm wondering if the problem is the fact that I'm waiting until I'm done playing a buffer before I resume the emulator. This would create slight gaps in time between playing consecutive audio buffers, and I'm wondering if this would cause the slight choppiness in audio that I'm hearing? Am I thinking about that correctly?\n If I am thinking about that correctly, then do I need to kind of estimate how long it will take to play the samples in the buffer, and then resume running the emulator slightly before its finished playing the current buffer? If so, what's the best way to achieve that? \n    submitted by    /u/smparsons111  \n [link]   [comments]",

After months of work, I've just released my own NES emulator for iOS called Retroman.\n Loading games is straightforward: simply save legal NES ROM files (.nes) to your device using the iOS Files app, then open Retroman and select the game you want to play. Retroman also supports loading ROMs directly from other iOS apps using the 'Open In' feature.\n As a dev and a gamer, my goal was to create something that really captures the essence of playing on the original hardware. Some key features I focused on:\n  \nSmooth gameplay with minimal lag\n Gamepad support for that authentic feel\n iCloud sync for saved states\n Options to tweak video & audio settings\n  \nI'm really proud of how it turned out, especially the performance and the privacy aspects (no data tracking, everything stays on your device).\n You can download Retroman from the App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id6502994389\n I'd love to hear your feedback, thoughts and suggestions about Retroman and how it compares to other NES emulators you've used. Your feedback on its performance, features, and overall experience will be crucial in guiding future updates and improvement\n https://preview.redd.it/b4h9avbemy8d1.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=9243bf2065c9aa0639a5f814355f415dd0f2e701\n    submitted by    /u/Complete_Estimate443  \n [link]   [comments]",

It has a 5 stage pipeline that includes interrupts, pipeline flushes, 1-BHT, and all the typical bells and whistles. I used C to take simple NASM assembly files and convert them into machine code. The CPU emulator would then take the machine code, convert it back to NASM (mainly for readability and debugging purposes), and then execute the instructions.\n From the research I've been doing it appears that making a GBC emulator would be better to start with than a GBA emulator. I'm good to go as far as determination, skill level, and time. It's mainly going to be a learning opportunity and portfolio piece. \n What would the perceived level of difficulty be compared to what I’ve already done?

          "description": "A common denominator in a hardware system (be it a microcontroller, a microcomputer or a computer) is the processor (or microprocessor - a.k.a. CPU). Among its most common elements are the instruction cycle, the dedicated registers (program counter, index register, stack pointer), and the general purpose registers. We also find other external elements also managed by the processor such as memory (RAM - here the stack is also managed - & ROM), I/O peripherals, or communication buses.\n In the emulation process it is obvious to me which hardware component corresponds to each of the previously mentioned elements, which facilitates the process of encapsulation of the code. The case of emulation of the CHIP-8 interpreter creates some doubts for me.\n I understand that the CHIP-8 interpreter embedded in a microcomputer (like the console COSMAC VIP) is a program written using the instruction set of the corresponding processor (e.g. RCA COSMAC) used to execute other programs (a.k.a. ROM) written using the instruction set of the CHIP-8 interpreter itself.\n At first, reading some implementation guides, I thought that when they referred to elements like the program counter, the index register or the general purpose registers they were referring to the physical resources of the processor. However, now I doubt if these elements are virtualizations of the CHIP-8 interpreter, that is, variables that the CHIP-8 interpreter creates and manages dynamically in the RAM memory of the microcomputer.\n I imagine that it could be this way because otherwise, in case the processor PC was pointing to a ROM instruction (using the CHIP-8 interpreter instruction set) and tried to decode, it would fail. Is this how it really works? Is it not? Is it partially?\n Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't quite understand how these three elements fit together: processor, execution of the CHIP-8 interpreter and execution of the ROM.\n Thanks in advance. \n    submitted by    /u/RolindaW  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For the NES PPU I'm confused on how the sprite pixels are combined with the background pixels during shifting/multiplexing to determine pixel color. The diagram here is... reasonably clear in showing how the background pixel is chosen via nametable/attribute fetches and scroll selection. But as far as I can tell it hand-waves exactly what the sprite pixel input is, simply listing [Sprites 0..7] as the input to the priority multiplexer. But what is that input?\n I've also read through Sprite Evaluation several times and I understand the relationship between OAM and secondary OAM; the latter holds the 8 sprites chosen for the upcoming scanline. But clearly it isn't the direct input into pixel selection because it's reset in the first 64 cycles of the current scanline. The details section lists that the secondary OAM data is \"fetched\" on cycles 257-320, but fetched to where?\n In javidx9's series he uses a shift register per scanline sprite (for 8 in total) which seems logical, it's essentially an extension of how background tiles work, but he seems to present this as the most straightforward way to do it in his emulator rather than a reflection of anything in the underlying hardware.\n The nesdev wiki doesn't seem to document what that sprite input is.

However, I'm at a roadblock when it comes to rendering the video output. I've tried a few different approaches, first trying SDL and then moving on to just using OpenGL libraries and I feel a bit lost. Does anyone have any good resources for getting OpenGL or SDL working for someone with no background in graphics programming?

Then the game loads as usual. \n IE: 0b0000'0001 | IF: 0b000'0001\n JOYP [FF00]: 0b1111'1111\n \n I press the mapped \"Start\" button: \n IE: 0b0000'0001 | IF: 0b0001'0000\n JOYP [FF00]: 0b1101'0111\n \n I release the mapped \"Start\" button: \n IE: 0b0000'0001 | IF: 0b0001'0000\n JOYP [FF00]: 0b1111'1111\n \n  \nAnd nothing happens. IE never becomes 0b0001'0001 in order to enable the interrupt. One source I read claims that that most games do not use this interrupt for joypad inputs.\n Interestingly, if I keep pressing \"Start\", at some point, the game registers that it has been pressed, and the screen advances. I have done the same with the other buttons, where the game loads, and I will, for example, press \"Left Arrow\" and the character will move, after like 50 button presses.\n Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated!

I asked for feedback and my manager said some of the infrastructure in the lower environments were not fully tested. In the seed round with no customers I tried to ship code quickly to the development environment to test. The feedback I got was although I was testing in the development environment, the developers felt like the development environment was unstable at times and were hesitant to trust me when it came to production. We never had a production outage with a customer but the fact that wasn’t battle tested with enterprise traffic scared them.\n Is there an acceptable protocol for testing terraform or helm charts in a development environment. We were using argocd and had a limited budget so I could only deploy in the shared development account for testing. \n Is there a recommend way to unit test boto3 calls in a lambda function, modern ways to test terraform and ansible ?

          "description": "I’m currently the Head of DevOps at my company, which means I’ve been spending a lot of time recently leading people rather than building things. While I love my team and the work we’re doing, I’ve found myself missing the hands-on engineering aspect of DevOps.\n For my sanity (and to sharpen my skills), I’ve decided to dedicate some of my free time to building and tinkering with projects. However, every time I sit down to start something, I end up staring at a blank screen, and my mind just goes blank.\n I’m looking for suggestions on what to build or work on. Here are a few areas I’m interested in, but I’m open to any and all ideas:\n 1. CI/CD Pipelines: Always looking to improve and innovate here. 2. Automation: Tools and scripts that can streamline processes. 3. Cloud Infrastructure: I’m particularly interested in AWS, but I’m open to exploring other providers. 4. Monitoring and Logging: Enhancing observability with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, etc. 5. Security: Implementing security best practices in the pipeline and infrastructure. 6. Kubernetes: Anything from setting up clusters to advanced scheduling and scaling techniques. \n I’m also very interested in contributing to open source projects. If you know of any active projects that could use some DevOps love, please point me in the right direction. I’d love to help out and collaborate with the community.\n If you’ve worked on a project that you found particularly interesting or challenging, I’d love to hear about it. Or if you have any other ideas, please share!\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/mac_bbe  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll mention I have less than a week until the interview. \n Also, I'll use the opportunity and ask what do you think of DevOps as a student position? does it \"lock me\" in DevOps style jobs further on?\n How can I take advantage of this first job to advance my skills as much as I can?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Trooped  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If you're a company offering tenure-based PTO starting at two weeks and scaling up to four weeks after 15-20 years of service, you're only going to be hiring new graduates and middling experienced employees. You largely shut yourself off not only from the best employees, but also from the experience and lessons learned in the outside industry. Even if you hire high-quality entry-level employees and by some miracle several of them stick around for ten years, they're not going to be as productive as comparable employees with ten years of diverse work experience. And these policies which presumably are meant to retain employees are almost certainly only going to retain the lowest quality employees as the others can find gainful employment with dramatically better PTO (and almost invariably better pay) anywhere else in the industry. \n This has been my experience when I worked for a tenure-based PTO company fresh out of school, and this is why I regard tenure-based PTO policies as a massive red flag when applying for jobs--even if I was willing to take a huge pay cut and a huge PTO cut to work on interesting problems, I can be reasonably certain that I'm going to be working in a sub-par environment with wildly outdated software development tools and practices under management that is actively fostering that environment.\n I'm curious what others think--am I way off base?

But for the bit after that where we roll out the change, that's more tricky. We've come with a few ideas. I've proposed having the ArgoCD apps watch Git tags in the config repo, then the CD updates the manifests files, commits them and moves the tag to that commit. We've also discussed using ArgoCD application sets to automate PRs in the config repo and apply the changes based on those.

For the first four months, there was a lot of work and I was learning something new every day (I came from the SWE area), but for the last three weeks I've had almost nothing to do and there's no sign of any optimistic scenario.\n Is it normal in this area (DevOps, Cloud) to have so much downtime? When should I worry? Sometimes I think they've hired wrong: there's no backlog and my leaders ask me to refactor SQL queries because they have no idea what else to ask for.

          "description": "Currently, we are a small company where the ops team consists of one manager and a few ICs (including myself). We initially hoped to expand the ops team, but due to a pivot in product direction, we had to let some members go and condense the team. Now, the team realistically won't be growing much.\n From my understanding, the role of an engineering manager, especially for ops, is to set priorities, shield their team from the bureaucracy of the other C-levels, and manage reviews and career growth. However, I've encountered a few roadblocks due to our manager's lack of technical expertise:\n - Communication Issues: The manager acts as a middleman, relaying requirements from other VPs to our team and then passing our feedback back. This has backfired because he doesn’t fully understand the technical asks from other teams.\n - Unclear Priorities: It's unclear whether the principal engineer or the engineering manager should set technical priorities. This has led to some discord.\n - Indecisiveness and Micromanagement: The manager seems indecisive, avoiding assigning tasks to avoid conflict, yet becomes micromanaging when tasks aren't completed as expected.\n While he is a good people person, his lack of technical skills and decisiveness is impacting the team. My teammates feel the same way. I’m looking for advice from fellow engineers who have had similar experiences. Currently, my plan is to collate examples and discuss them with my team, then have a talk with him to provide feedback. If there’s no change, we may need to escalate the issue to his boss. However, I want to give him a chance to respond to our feedback first before taking it higher.\n Anyone else have this issue?

Merging a PR into main releases to staging, and creating a new Github release will promote the latest staging image to production, all automated Github Actions. Works great. But now you want to add one or several hotfix commits to production, but not release the in progress features already out on staging. What's the best way to do that?\n  \nHave two long lived branches, e.g. develop and main. If you merge a hotfix/ branch to main, it now builds and releases a second image: prod+hotfix. Automation can merge the hotfix commit back to develop (?) so it's also out on staging. But this way you have to build artifacts, ugh.\n Stay with one long lived branch, check out the latest released tag (representing the current state of prod), add your hotfix and build a new image off that branch for production, and merging to main will also add the hotfix commit to staging. Again two artifacts, and the prod image will be built off a short lived hotfix branch?\n  \nHow do smart people handle this?

Meaning no code repo, no pipelines. The only tech they have was previously done by a vendor to create their current application which is currently running on Azure AKS.\n Long story short, I felt that before I can even do any development, a proper dev environment is required, meaning owning code repo, CI/CD pipelines till deployment (staging/prod)\n I have roughly pieced out the picture and would appreciate everyone’s input on whether this is feasible.\n Git repo - Gitlab. Even though i’ve never used gitlab before, it seems to be the best/easiest to conduct CI/CD.\n In the gitlab-ci yml, Im thinking of having diff stages like testing, before building and pushing the image to a container registry.\n The container registry I’m thinking of using Azure Container Registry since the company already uses Azure. \n From there, I believe AKS can pull the image and deploy as a Kubernetes cluster.\n As for the infra, Im thinking of using Terraform for proper versioning. Ive also read about K9 which helps manage the K8s.\n So in short, if my understanding is correct, i can have tests, build image, push image to Container Registry, deploy and run the image as Kubernetes in AKS, all within the Gitlab-ci yml? If that is so, gitlab is really impressive.\n Did I miss any crucial parts in this pipeline?

          "description": "Hello everyone, I have just entered my 40s and am an average-skilled software developer.\n In the past, I have some experience in developing CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitLab, and now I am currently working as a React/Java developer. Recently, I received an offer to work as a DevOps engineer at a large corporation that heavily uses Jenkins.\n The reason they are hiring me, someone with a mixed career of development and CI/CD experience, instead of a DevOps expert, is probably because their Groovy scripts have become very large and complex, necessitating a dedicated software engineer to refactor/manage them. My main responsibilities would be developing and maintaining Jenkins pipelines for on-prem legacy systems, which would account for about 60-70% of my work, with the remainder involving DevOps tool development using Python and shell scripts, and cloud infra automation tasks as some of their services are running on the cloud. I feel that if I stay here for 3-4 years, I might find it difficult to come back to a developer or work on anything other than managing legacy Jenkins tasks, yet the salary is 30% higher than my current one, which makes the decision challenging. TBH, I don't have extensive experience in managing Jenkins, so I'm not sure if the job is going to be terrible or surprisingly manageable..\n Would you take a 30% salary increase to manage legacy Jenkins systems? What would you do in my situation? If I manage to become a Jenkins expert with moderate experience in infrastructure automation through tools like Terraform or Ansible, would that make me still competitive in the market as a DevOps professional?\n    submitted by    /u/CommonOnionHello  \n [link]   [comments]",

My boss wrote them from scratch and what we do every time we have a new microservices or app is copy the last one and modify it. So far so good… However we have a very complex and flexible hierarchy of values, templates, and stuff that I don’t even know if they’re normal terms — trigger files and seed files, which a python script takes as inputs to generate the app set.\n We have a multi-tenant architecture in regions all over the world in both AWS and Azure, and of course many environments, including the standard dev/qa/prod as well as cloud vs on-prem, so this is part of the reason for the open-ended nature of the way he designed things. It feels like a very loose (undocumented) framework that requires complete knowledge in. It’s pure gitops which I love, but often I find myself staring at a yaml and wondering what something does, how it fits in, and if it’s overridden somewhere else. I spend a lot of time recursive grepping, looking at Argo overrides (I hate the tag bubble format), and in general wasting time. \n In a way this reminds me of Puppet hiera, but obviously more complex. The fix for that was Foreman with the UI that had taxonomy and inheritance. Is there anything like that for helm values? Is there any automation tool or popular framework that creates standardized app sets? (And helm charts?) Again the parallel would be something like creating an rpm from scratch vs having a polished script or tool like fpm to standardize the process. I’d love to have a Wizard-like tool guide me through the process. “Does your app need to talk to kube-API? No? Then you don’t need a dedicated service account. Let’s delete that from the chart so it doesn’t blow up when you don’t set values for it.” Etc. \n I’m a smart guy but this really feels like the Wild West out here. \n    submitted by    /u/shulemaker  \n [link]   [comments]",

We deal with higly confidential data and have a complex server architecture where some test environments can be accessed only through ssh from certain servers.\n Recuirements: On premises. Podman compability. Can send commands to a server through another server.\n Bonus: Mercurial support (we are considering migration to git) Easy to learn, use and maintain. RobotFramework and/or PyTest support. Not too expensive.\n We have been considering Jenkins or TeamCity and confirmed that both pass the requirements. While Jenkins is old & clunky and atm its mercurial plugin isn't actively maintained, it is free, unlike TeamCity which would ramp up in cost quickly since we'd need agents for all of our test servers.\n A quick look through this sub gave me the impression that you love GitLab CI.

I can see from their website that it might indeed be cheaper, but hard to know if there's any other hidden fees. As for more secure I also couldn't find much info that wasn't from Oracle themselves. Plus we're not using a DB, we mostly use EC2, S3, a VPC and load balancer from AWS.\n As for company connections, do companies really connect over the backend servers they use?\n I'm trying not to be too negative, but I'm struggling not to think that my manager was just given the sales pitch for something that will at best be the same but with a different company.\n Edit: Thanks for all the replies, I’m definitely going to have another meeting and if the manager is too far gone then that’s a big red flag (more than what’s already happened). \n    submitted by    /u/astrellon3  \n [link]   [comments]",

AAP is the majority of my day, gitlab, building out automations in service now, using terraform in places, most of my automations center around provisioning networking(layer 2-3, BGP, etc), firewalls, hypervisors, storage, VMs. \n It's been fun, but with the Broadcom acquisition, the money has been drying up, I've seen so many of my work family fired. I've been losing the war to inflation as my pay hasn't kept up with my increasing costs. I'm starting to think I need to find a new workplace. I'm afraid to even go through application cycles because I don't have AWS/Azure on my resume and you just don't see job postings that are akin to who we would hire.\n Do I hammer out a cloud cert?

Public cloud isn't an option for compliance reasons.\n The team I've just joined is wrangling about the container solution for the new platform. The user traffic they get is not that big. It is certain to increase as they scale up, although I couldn't say how much exactly. It doesn't feel like the stack is complex enough to go to K8s just yet. If it was AWS I would probably be pushing for ECS, because it's a good choice for small-to-medium scale workloads, it can go quite a long way before needing to migrate to K8S, and it's pretty straightforward to get going with.\n But this is the on-prem world which is all new to me. I'm not sure what ECS equivalents there are, or whether there even are any and maybe it's normal to just go to K8s. Plus I'm aware that thinking of 'equivalents' is perhaps not the right way to approach things, but it is just new territory that I'm trying navigate. They currently use Docker Swarm. I don't know much about it but some people I've spoken to have been quite derisive of it.\n Any input? Also curious to hear of experiences from anyone who switched from AWS/public cloud to on-prem, what challenges you found and what kind of things you had to get used to.\n Edit: When I say K8s I'm also including managed K8s services like Rancher and Openshift. If we do go with K8s I highly doubt we'll be doing it from scratch, that would be hellish.\n    submitted by    /u/Coffeebrain695  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am an experienced linux engineer. I know bash, python and SQL pretty well. I am learning C++ and java at my new software support job. Done some automation with docker, powershell, and ansible. Done some powerbi and excel pivot tables. Now working on APIs, AI and bot projects. I feel like all this can be summed up as a devops engineer already. But it's mostly been support for 11 years. Salary is $90K. I want to double that before I turn 40. 35 now. I learned linux mostly from one other job and my own home server. Before that was sysadmin windows and hardware for 9 years.\n Is this enough to apply for devsecops positions in the next couple of years? I want to focus on backend engineering. I like being a linux expert, I like the scripting and I love to use python when I can. I'd like to pivot away from support and maintenance to just development and little interaction with clients. Wouldn't mind checking out quant either. I am currently leaning on my dev team at my current company to help me out and take me under their wing in the next few months or so. I plan to stay at this company for at most 3 years. but won't look down on any $180k offers that may come my way before that haha What should I look for after that?\n    submitted by    /u/moderatenerd  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I work at a company that tends to have an \"all hands on deck\" incident culture, very similar to this post from r/sysadmin. My team owns an application networking infrastructure platform that has internal developer teams as our customers.\n We have built our platform to be almost completely self-service to developer teams, including providing telemetry tools (logs, metrics, traces) that developers can use to troubleshoot problems that pass through our platform.\n However, our team has noticed a pattern during incidents where a developer team and/or their leadership will pull our team into incident troubleshooting meetings if our platform is involved at all in the impacted business/application flow (ex: Client -> Platform 1 -> App 1 -> Our platform -> App 2).\n As a result of this, our team has become more efficient on ruling out our platform from the problem (using the same self service telemetry tools mentioned before). For 95+% of incidents, our platform is not the problem and it ends up being an issue with another developer teams application. This efficiency has saved us a lot of time and avoided blame for incidents, but the constant pull for our team still adds up and results in a lot of wasted time on these incident meetings.\n From a business perspective, leadership wants us involved whenever possible to reduce business impact and MTTD/MTTR. We are struggling to find a way to change the organizational culture where developers will use our self service tools to troubleshoot incidents rather than relying on us to interpret the telemetry for them.\n Have you all had similar experiences at your companies as platform owners? If so, how did you improve this culture so that your team reduces toil and gets more time to work on platform improvements/features?\n    submitted by    /u/vinnishi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd love to work directly on a game (even if I did DevOps 50% of the time to be valuable) or another role contributing to open source software. My struggle is that my resume wouldn't reflect great as a recent dev and my dev skills need a bit of brushing up as I spent most of my time working with Python.

We're currently mostly on AWS-GCP, some Azure exposure and to add to the mess, some old onprem stuff on V-Sphere. \n So far I've been dealing mostly with AWS myself, successfully automating the patching of EC2 instances using the in-built functionalities like PatchManager and AWS' Automations. \n As of today for some reason, the bosses don't want to patch our servers from within the cloud provider anymore but they're asking for a solution that can be centralised instead, with the goal of patching all of our servers with one unified procedure, regardless of their cloud location or operating system (We run RedHat, Debian, AmazonLinux etc.).\n I need to come up with a plan. So far I've been thinking maybe I could set up Ansible Playbooks and run them across all the VMs targeting their operating system, that's the first thing that comes to mind.

          "description": "Hi guys,\n Right now I have several different UI apps which are on different domains.\n I want to move them all to a single domain and separate them by an url path, for example:\n www.foo.bar/grafana\n www.foo.bar/rabbitmq \n The way I've envisioned this is that I'd be using nginx proxy_pass to forward requests to local services with a config like that:\n location /grafana/ { proxy_pass https://grafana.local/; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host; proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding; sub_filter_types *; sub_filter_once off; sub_filter \"src=\\\"\" \"src=\\\"grafana/\" } \n , but I've encountered 2 problems: \n  \nHtml is trying to download resources from base domain, not from domain + path. So for example if there is some element in html having src=\"path/style.css\" browser will try to download from www.foo.bar/path/style.css and not www.foo.bar/grafana/path/style.css. This will obviously fail as nginx won't know what to do with this request.\n This can be dealt with using \"sub_filter\" directive (with some pain) so it's not that bad. However, the next problem is much worse. \n \nRedirects\n The problem is very similar to the previous one. When I go to the grafana index page it redirects me to /login path. The issue is that it will take me to www.foo.bar/login and not www.foo.bar/grafana/login. I haven't found any way of dealing with this and it's preventing me from proceeding. Grafana is kind enough to give you root_url config which is made for situations like these, but rabbitmq or kafka-ui and other services simply don't. \n \n Anyone has any experience with stuff like this? \n    submitted by    /u/Present_You_5294  \n [link]   [comments]",

My current role exposes me to a wide range of tech (AWS, CI/CD, Terraform, GitHub/GitLab, ECS/Docker, Datadog, scripting, etc.) and even some Python work with Data and Analytics teams. However, the one thing missing is that feels substantial (to me?) is Kubernetes (k8s) experience – at a previous role I used it for just over 1 year. Our tech stack is composed mostly of EC2/ASG (bootstrapped with poorly written chef from a company we bought, bleh), Lambda, CDNs, some ECS and API GW.\n I’m 29, and while my current company offers room for advancement to senior roles and beyond, I’m worried that not having more k8s experience, right now, could impact my career for the worse. There’s a possibility we might use Kubernetes in the future as we are in the early stages of migrating most of our applications to containers and ECS, and if the use case for orchestration arises, but it’s not certain.\n Would you recommend jumping to a new job where k8s exposure is guaranteed, or should I stay put and hope for future opportunities with k8s at my current company?\n Looking forward to your advice!\n TL;DR:\n Enjoy my current DevOps job with good pay and growth potential, but lacking Kubernetes exposure.

          "description": "I've had a couple of intriguing conversations recently that have left me seeking some more clarity. I'm currently a Senior Developer, and I know this is subjective for everyone, but I'm trying to form a solid opinion about my future path.\n In a 1:1 with my former Manager, they mentioned they wouldn’t be surprised if I became an Engineering Manager but would be very surprised if I ended up as a Technical Lead. This got me thinking—do they believe I can excel more technically?\n Following that, I had a 1:1 with my skip-level manager, who asked me to consider which path I should pursue: technical leadership or people leadership.\n Right now, I have a significant opportunity to pursue either path. My current Manager sees potential in me for a much larger role on the team and has indicated that I’ll be consulted on many decisions moving forward. For example, I'll have oversight on every epic our team decides to tackle and can take the lead on any that interest me.\n What are your thoughts on choosing between a technical leader and a people leader? What factors should I consider in making this decision?\n    submitted by    /u/latestbot  \n [link]   [comments]",

The role is mostly Python, supporting user facing workflows, adding integration with APIs for payment and pre-filled data, etc.\n Edit: some great responses so far and I see I also did a bad job asking my question. I don't expect people to write specific questions tailored to my job posting for me, although I'm going to look at the questions people suggested for sure.\n I also should clarify that I'm not new to being an interviewer. I've been on many hiring committees for non technical positions and a few technical ones, and we always stick with pretty much behavioral questions. I'm having to hire for 2 additional technical roles soon and I keep seeing people talk about technical interviews with a test or other coding challenge in the interview, and I am curious about the value of that and also what would make it effective and respectful of everyone's time. Especially since I often see complaints about these kinds of interviews but they appear to be quite popular from the employer side. I want to know what I've been missing by not asking these and avoid the pitfalls.\n If the consensus was that these don't have any real value, especially when interviewing people who actually have a few years of experience, I'd be comfortable sticking with my tried and true behavioral interview questions. But I haven't done enough technical hires to know the value of the coding test without getting some outside feedback.\n Thanks for all of the food for thought so far!\n    submitted by    /u/cranberrydarkmatter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I feel like come across anti-DRY advice much more than pro-DRY these days. I get that you can go too far in either direction but in my experience repeated code is much more trouble than overly DRY code. \n I've spent the last 4 years working on and refactoring a long running product that needed a lot of cleanup when I started. Lots of repeated code AND lots of overabstraction (eg. inheritance chains 7 deep). The repeated code was by far more troublesome. The real killer is that repeated code would drift apart over the years, and it was impossible to know if it was deliberate or accidental. eg. does this copy just have a bug? or is it a deliberate change? or can this code path just not get into this state? Dealing that problem is an order of magnitude worse than just wrapping your head around extreme abstractions. \n For that reason alone, I would generally advice people to err on the DRY side as opposed to the other. Atleast with DRY code, you have a source of truth to work from, even if it's a giant mess. \n One thought is that it could be related to timescales. The longer code has been around, the worse the drift can get. For projects that have only been around for 3-5 years, maybe it won't get too bad.

First I assume Postgres of course, but I have been talking about that the entire interview, why would they be asking that? I was unsure, so I asked for clarity on what they meant specifically and how it related to sql. Interviewer talks for a minute about how it’s a “batch data processing tool used to parse through chunks of data, as compared to regular sql.” At this point I am extremely confused, thinking it’s some type of 3rd party stored procedure tool. I respond that I’m afraid I do not have experience with this technology, although I do have experience with many tools that are similar.\n I go on and finish the interview talking extensively about Postgres use cases and functions.

I've been in my current role for just under 2 years. My options paperwork is similarly 2 years late, my last two asks for raises have been declined, and the rest of my team has been laid off from under me.

I've had an offer from another startup for around $150,000 which seems a lot more relaxed.

With large distributed teams, I spend a lot of time wondering who is \"steering the ship\" and making the larger macro decisions. At one of the companies the CTO was very involved for a while, reviewing RFCs, meeting regularly with tech leads, making architectural decisions etc. Then we got a new non-technical CTO and things now seem all over the place with no cohesive vision.\n There's something to be said for absolute autonomy for teams, but I also wonder about the longer term sustainability if there's ~100 teams all building things slightly different. It seems to me that there should be some group that has insight into what everyone is doing in some capacity (from a technical standpoint), and ensuring consistency and standards. Since we don't have that, I'm thinking my assumptions might be wrong here, so I'm curious about the experience at other companies.\n So, how are things done at the companies you've worked at? Did you have a specific person or group that worked on the technical vision and cohesiveness of the entire org?

          "description": "If we’re actually being so “agile” and using the whole feedback loop the system is designed for, then why is it such a big deal to have constant deadlines and an even bigger issue when an arbitrary deadline set by management is missed? It doesn’t seem like it should be an issue if the sprint goal is missed when there are unforeseen problems or work needed to be done. Isn’t that kinda the whole point, to be able to adapt on the fly and work incrementally? \n Obviously this shouldn’t always happen, but it’s not necessarily the developer’s fault if it does either. Usually I think it’s a failure of leadership more than anything if the work can’t be done smoothly for whatever reasons. Tech debt, lack of documentation, no ownership of codebases, etc. All this planning and all these tools seem to be underutilized and more just a way of managers keeping tabs on progress as work gets completed. And so that they can put a hard stop on a “project” even though there almost never truly is, but they want to be able to put their stamp on a successful project. \n Instead of using all these great tools that allow for asynchronous teamwork and should increase productivity, we all sit in hours of meetings every day with way too many people where 90% of them have no reason to be there. And we’re all working across different time zones so it’s never easy to get something scheduled. I really think if there are more than 5 or so people on a call at one time it’s a complete waste of time and most people are just there for show.\n    submitted by    /u/TheRealJamesHoffa  \n [link]   [comments]",

The reality is that bad teams will never do true Agile or true scrum. And nothing about Agile prevents extreme bastardization of its ideas. \n So what are your opinions?

          "description": "I have been working for a database company for the last 6 years and I have \"ownership\" of a major product in this company (I actually posted here recently and the full details are here). In a nutshell, I inherited a legacy backup and recovery system and replaced most of this code with a proper and elegant solution.\n There is one component in the machinery that is responsible for synchronizing a specific type of data. Think something like a system table in a relational database. I never got around to replacing this part of the code because I would likely break the whole company (literally) - so I pushed hard to build up some sort of collaborative effort between the other teams to replace this but this effort never went anywhere because \"if it ain't broken, don't fix it.\" This has been going on for years now.\n I desperately warned them that this needed to be replaced. Why? Many of the algorithms in the code are running in quadratic time because the code was written \"quick and dirty\" to launch the product in the early days. Fine. And most of our clients are also running low-GB sized deployments as well so there's no real perceivable delay in backing up data (think a few minutes tops).\n However, two of our clients which pay more than all the other clients combined, recently decided to set up a backup and recovery system. These clients have A LOT of data and the projected sync time for this data is looking for 3 months to a year per sync cycle. It's already been several months on one client and that client's C-suite has essentially reached out and said that this is unacceptable.\n Now all fingers are pointed at me, and well, I've been saying that this would happen. The thing is that I don't want to burn bridges or \"be that guy\" but there isn't exactly an immediate solution to this problem when the code is already out in the wild... at least not an easy solution\n Has anyone else experienced this?

I started to notice that making Go DRY felt like a code smell. I will create an abstraction if I understand the code enough. But I use to be obsessed with this.\n \nI don't think dynamic languages are that great on the backend. I use to think it was only performance, but lack of a type system is a big problem. I use to try to make Python and Ruby code work in the backend. You can certainly write code faster in those languages, but they feel like liabilities.\n \nMemory safety maybe isn't that great anymore. As a Go dev who use to be a Java dev. All I know are JVMs. But I've found garbage collection gets in the way, and optimizing or building around the GC is quite a pain. It requires very specialized knowledge of the language, and learning how to save allocations. In Go's case it can lead to some very unreadable code.

          "description": "First of all, I’d like to thank this sub for being helpful on my journey where I currently don’t have senior colleagues. \n The problem: it’s an early-stage startup. We’re just two developers: I’m around the mid level, they’re a co-founder and have no programming/CS background (basically junior), there’re no seniors and no CTO. Unfortunately, lately, I realized that the code they have been written is not well-thought and doesn’t allow to develop new features fast (we haven’t had code reviews because of tight deadlines). It also seems to me that everyone has been doing things their way, so there’s no consistency (linter is set up but seems to be ignored). \n Long story short, I failed with delivering expectations because I had to spend extra time by untangling what was written prior me. (I’m not a genius myself and provide nonoptimal/bad solutions too). I believe, though, it would be quite important to communicate to my boss that they need to revise their approach to writing code if they want us to be efficient and to be able to work together. I don’t think they’re aware of the issue. So far their main argument and approach was “It works. Users don’t care”, which I agree with but I also think there should be some balance because it’s getting harder to have a collaborative work. \n Should I tell my boss that they need to work on their code? If yes, how would you communicate it politely without pointing any fingers? Or does it sound like a hopeless situation and it’d be better to just give up on it and start looking for something else?\n TL;DR: my boss is a co-founder, not an SWE but contributes to the codebase. Lately, it’s been really hard to get through their code and work efficiently. They don’t seem to be aware of it. Should I tell them and how, or the situation is hopeless because of the power imbalance, and I should just give up and start looking for something else?\n    submitted by    /u/highwayxcavalier  \n [link]   [comments]",

If someone had asked me to redesign the system I was refactoring, I wouldn't be able to do it since I didn't really understand it.\n Also, this kind of underlies bus factors etc, where a person leaves the company and you have software systems that you now only have statistical control over, but not intellectual control any more. Often having to painfully regain intellectual control.\n I'm curious to hear stories of teams that ran heavy on statistical control (maybe a catchall team that inherited orphan systems).

Myself and another dev ended up getting asked to monitor our apps for 2 weeks following the go-live. A year later, that dev has moved on but I’m still stuck monitoring our applications (granted I at least have a half decent Splunk dashboard now). \n I gotta be honest, it’s really exhausting. When I find an issue, Im expected to do a write up consisting of finding the root cause and determining the impact, which is usually not a quick and easy task. And I wouldn’t be complaining too much if I wasn’t expected to continue to work cards as a developer as well. Lately I’ve been working 10-12 hours days just to keep up with the workload. I’m tired. \n This isn’t normal, is it? The seniors and leads above me acknowledge it’s a bad solution, but project management is fine with it for the most part. I’m struggling to find a way out of this, conversations about getting help have gone no where and any efforts I’ve made towards off loading this have been ignored. I understand I could take the initiative to learn Splunk best practices, but I genuinely do not have the energy to take that on.

No TS, no frameworks or DI, just pure javascript.\n  \nAnd some other things I've noticed:\n  \nJira tickets are not well defined.

Their salaries are admittedly under market rate and WELL within the budget. I asked my boss for previous performance reviews for each employee and he said, \"oh we don't do that here\". As far as I can tell, they have never made any major fumbles. They all work hard and most of them put in extra hours without asking.\n I took the approach of \"let me coach them and work with them on the areas they can improve\". I am a big fan of the \"coach\" role as a manager and that has always worked well for me in the past. My boss however, doesn't want any of that shit. My general vibe is that he is just a very negative person and never has anything good to say about anyone. I can count on one hand the number of times I have seen him smile.\n So basically, I am sticking up for my team and I haven't joined in on the pity party. This has already put me on the outs with him. I'm pretty sure he didn't want anyone to actually lead or manage, but just someone who could join in with his bitch fest. \n His skip level is the CEO and the CEO is completely checked out. I've pretty much hit a brick wall with this guy already as he seems to just dislike everyone in general. Any advice on how to salvage this situation?\n    submitted by    /u/NoLavishness1314  \n [link]   [comments]",

My new job is also a lead engineer position (same as before) in a consulting company that also has some SaaS products. The problem is that I see serious red flags and I am thinking about if it's worth to invest my time and energy in it.\n  \nThey seem to have a buzzword driven development. The architecture is a Microservices, event based (Kafka) application. What they process is like 100k events a month. I don't see any justification for this over engineering.\n There are so many services and queues for allmost everything, which would be easily done by just calling a function.\n It's not possible to debug the system for several components, mostly python stuff. They really commit code and deploy it to k8 to debug these components. I have seen 100 commits for one feature just for debugging.\n Most components have no dependency management at all. Not even a simple requirements.txt for python related stuff. \n The core developers left the company and there was one week for the handover of these critical components.\n The documentation is almost non-existent.\n  \nI am now there for 1 month and it seems like the part of the system what I should take care off is a bunch services that are at prototype-level experiments put to production. Almost all best practices are missing and it seems like they are constantly pushing for new features, instead fixing the mess. Additionally, the technology is outdated already and should be replaced to stay competitive.\n However, the product idea itself is interesting and I have the experience to transform that into good state (technically). On the other hand it will be hard to shift the culture as they are not a product company.

          "description": "Hi,\n I'm currently working at a Fortune 500 company as a Mid/Senior Engineer with around 6 years of experience. I earn approximately $150k total compensation (140k base + 10k bonus) and work 10-20 hours per week.\n Our department's workload is light because we're waiting to migrate a core component to production, which has been delayed several times. The next major project is a massive system rewrite spanning multiple teams and likely taking years, but it's unclear how much work our team will have. Our team lead is still trying to secure work for us.\n My current tasks involve making a few enterprise requests, editing Terraform files occasionally, and debugging issues—mostly grunt work. \n Even when debugging issues arise, a junior engineer or another engineer often jumps in and takes over, even though I'm supposed to be the go to person for this. This is particularly frustrating because it feels like I'm being sidelined. Perhaps I've asked too many questions or come across as annoying, or maybe he's simply quicker to respond. Recently, he was included in a triage meeting while I wasn't, which has really affected my self-esteem. I might be overthinking it, but it's been bothering me a lot.\n Any interesting projects are quickly taken by our lead engineer and his preferred contractor.\n While I don't consider myself a \"rockstar\" engineer, I take pride in my problem-solving skills. However, the lack of challenging work is causing my skills to stagnate, and I'm worried about losing my edge.\n I'm feeling uncertain about my career and regret choosing a role at a boring insurance/finance company. Although I'm interviewing elsewhere, it's tough to even get interviews now. My interview success rate has dropped from around 60% to about 5%.\n I'm feeling lost and unsure about how to progress in my career. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I went and explained a lot of my frustrations to our CEO, he promised to look into it and get my answers. Within an hour the CTO sat me down with our CEO, and he told me straight to my face he did not see me as someone who would be capable as a tech lead, nor someone capable of running a team. In his mindset as i am too \"rigid\" and not willing to take \"risks\".\n I was really taken back, but just accepted it as i realized that yeah with my salary and having less on my plate was fine. I then burned all my vacation time and asked our CEO if he would be willing to let me have a month off paid. He let me. \n So i went away and spent almost 3 months fully expecting to be let go when i came back. I removed slack from my phone, and went with my SO on an extended vacation, spent a bunch of time polishing resume and working on leet code for a month. It was amazing. \n I came back and i was not let go. I even switched teams internally to our AI team, to pump up my resume in case i am let go. Last month i got another 10% pay raise for my \"excellent\" work from my manager, and our CTO inquired about if i would be willing to step up to become a staff engineer with no real pay raise. I said no. \n I work maybe 20 hours a week now including meetings completely remotely, do my tasks for our sprint, then clock off. It has been the happiest i ever have been.

We are part of a medium-sized engineering department with 400 people.\n Everything was perfect when we started as a small team of 8 building the app. We produced high-quality code with very few bugs. Last year, my team doubled in size to 15 people. Now, we are more prone to bugs and errors, partly due to the hiring of some inexperienced developers.\n Earlier this year, we launched the app and it was a great success. The engineering department now thinks it’s a good idea to integrate React and backend engineers into our team for a \"learning\" experience. However, these inexperienced developers are committing atrocious code. It only slows us down and increases the number of bugs. Just today, I was browsing our app and landed on a page I worked on a month ago. The page has become unusable because a React developer \"worked\" on it, introducing numerous anti-patterns.\n I'm not even sure what we are working on anymore. I keep finding pages and features that we weren't made aware of.\n You might argue that our PR process should improve, but it’s impossible to review every PR when 7 other teams are committing their code to the mobile codebase. I now spend most of my time either reviewing PRs or helping someone learn Swift.\n How much of a red flag is this?

          "description": "I want to get people’s opinion on this. I have dealt with hands off managers who may still be technical. I have also dealt with hands on managers who jump in and write a lot of code themselves. I will say that in almost every case where managers are writing code it’s pretty much a disaster.\n Now there are cases where teams are tiny, only consisting of maybe 3 members and a lot of work. So managers may have no choice but to write code. In some startup situations it makes sense. But it should be looked at as temporary and not something permanent.\n I have found managers who write code tend to get requirements and not share them with the team. Building things in secret. Or they just don’t allow the team to do any interesting work, only leaving them scraps to work with. They can also just push their code across in code reviews because they are the boss. And even if they allow their code to be reviewed they can just ignore comments and bypass all the checks or coerce reviewers to approve their code anyway. Also they can just push their code across and it doesn’t have to be QA’ed.\n I have ran into this. Where our manager created a caching layer due to an optimization roadmap. We have no clue he had been working on this service. And it was kind of an agreement he had between himself and my VP. They both agreed he should work on it because they needed to get this deliver quickly and the normal process would be cumbersome. This was launched in prod. Disaster struck. Due to a threading issue customers were seeing other customer account info. This was a phased deployment so the impact was only 1% in a specific region. But this should have never made it to production at all.\n I have also found managers who code don’t develop good teams. Again they hog up all the interesting work. Refuse to share their knowledge or let anyone work on things they are working on. And it just feels toxic to me. \n But what are you opinions?

          "description": "Our CEO returned from a retreat recently from one of those CEO groups where they help each other solve problems and whatnot. One of the guys runs a software company and claims that he was able to replace 9 devs in the Philippines with one full stack engineer and AI.\n Now my CEO is asking me if we can do the same with our dev team in Europe. The problem is my team is small with 1 FE, 1 BE, 1 DevOps, 1 DBA, 1 BA, and 1 SA. They’re all really specialized. Maybe I could get someone who’s full stack to do the job of the FE and BE, but I’d still need 2 FTEs just to achieve the same output. \n I’m pretty certain our CEOs peer was embellishing his claim a bit. But he’s convinced we can do the same. Anyone have advice on this? \n Edit: haha thanks everyone the comments have been fun to read.\n    submitted by    /u/PablanoPato  \n [link]   [comments]",

The past few years, the quality of the codebases I’ve inherited has been abysmal. I worked on a software product from a well known company, with tens of thousands of users, that provided a user experience that could only be described as grueling. I’ve interviewed dozens of developers over the past few years and many did not display basic, fundamental knowledge.\n This is to say, I never expected to have trouble finding work for the foreseeable future. IME, there’s no shortage of work that needs to be done. I have been looking for two months and have not had a single interview. A friend, who is a very strong dev, told me that 3 devs he currently works with have been looking for other jobs for 6-9 months and they’ve found nothing, and he says they’re good. He believes that employers know this, and are using it to squeeze more work out of people. Every employed developer I’ve talked to is overworked and stressed out. \n What is going on? This is not normal. I have a couple of theories, but when I hear myself explaining them, I sound like a crackpot.\n  \nEmployers are frustrated at developers refusing to return to the office and are applying pressure\n With a polarizing presidential election this year, companies are reluctant to make long term plans and commit to budgets when the business environment could be drastically different, come January, depending on the winner\n Employers are creating artificial job scarcity in order to influence the outcome of the election \n  \nThis is not a political post, please don’t flame me.

Some of it doesn't even fit together.\n They want to incorporate Lean™ so we can focus on whatever is most important at the moment, but also deliver a PI for our SAFe framework, which does Scrum with sprints, but we should use Kanban....\n At the same time, they're also trying to change naming, implement different Domains™ and move to The Spotify Model™ for team organisation (which I now am being forced to call a Squad instead of a team, under pain of being interrupted every time I mention a team).\n It feels like this is a little bit of overkill, a combination of FOMO around agile processes and also not really knowing what'll work best and just hoping to throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks.\n Do any of you out there have experience with a process heavy company, and ways to manage this? Effective ways to push back against an abundance of this, or even just a mindset shift so I don't pop off in my fifth Lean training session?\n    submitted by    /u/paupersdrop  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm an experienced software engineer with about 12 YOE, and for the first time in my career, I'm going through an extended period of unemployment. I was laid off from my last company during a restructuring last November, and I haven't had a lot of luck finding a new role yet. I'm reaching a point where I will need to start considering other roles possibly outside of the tech world just to keep some kind of income coming in.\n My question is, what kinds of jobs out there are a good fit for someone in this position? Has anyone else with a lot of developer experience taken a job during a layoff (even if only temporarily) and found it to be a really good match, or possibly a rewarding experience? Does anyone have a \"go-to\" kind of job during layoffs or downtime that they look for to maintain some kind of income?\n Thank you for any advice!\n    submitted by    /u/CategoryCory  \n [link]   [comments]",

If yes, then how do I know the \"level of complexity\" of a problem.\n Is the difference in the velocity at which I work? If yes, then how do I know if I am at the right speed, at half the speed, or at double the speed of my level.\n  \nIt is funny because companies sometimes define this degree of expertise by how you relate to the other coworkers, such as \"solves questions from coworkers\" or \"provides mentorship\" or whatever.

          "description": "While I appreciate the opportunity to work remotely and the flexibility it provides, I've noticed a significant lack of communication and support from management, particularly my manager and tech lead. In fact, the only time I seem to interact with my manager is when I need approval for time off or have HR-related questions. This distant relationship is quite different from my previous experiences where I had open and frequent communication with my bosses.\n I've also noticed that the majority of my team members are Desi India, which makes me wonder if the lack of communication could be attributed to cultural differences. I stated this because I had a manager who was Desi India at my last company for month and he never attend stand up and left everything to the tech lead before he was replaced replace.\n Despite expressing my concerns during a 1-1 meeting with my tech lead after three months on the job, little has changed. While I was reassured that I was doing a good job, it's difficult for me to understand how that assessment is made when there's minimal interaction or feedback. Additionally, I've observed discrepancies in the level of support provided to different team members, which is concerning and leads me to question my role within the team.\n When I participate in stand-ups or lead meetings, it often feels like my contributions are overlooked or ignored. As an African American engineer, I can't help but wonder if I've been hired for diversity reasons rather than for my engineering skills. This realization is disheartening and leaves me feeling undervalued and frustrated.\n I turned down other job opportunities earlier this year because I wanted to commit to this the commit for at least 6 months but the current situation has left me questioning that decision. I believe in the potential of this company and the work we're doing, but I also recognize the importance of feeling supported and valued in my role.\n    submitted by    /u/southernhacker56  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have 3 tech stacks and 2 people per stack for redundancy. I’ve got 15yoe overall.\n We’ve never had an on-call chart despite the rest of the larger IT team having one, my job description says “occasional nights and weekends”. I do, however have a company provided cell phone I leave in another room at night.\n Last week there was a network outage impacting our applications and leadership struggled to get anyone on the phone from Dev to help out at 3am.\n The next day leadership declared that the expectation for us was now that we have to be available 24/7 and able to get to our tools quickly unless we were on PTO.\n I was livid so didn’t ask any follow-ups, nor did the rest of my team. I’ve already started polishing my resume but really have enjoyed my job up until this moment. But, I have 2 toddlers and place tremendous value on my personal time and sleep isn’t always a guarantee.\n I’m left wondering, what does this mean if I plan to hike or camp with out internet? What does this mean if I have a few beers? What if I’m driving out of state to visit family? I refuse to clear these types of things with my job.\n Does anyone have any experience as a Dev with this type of demand for availability? I’m at 15yoe and never had this. This policy isn’t covered in the employee handbook either.\n I plan on fighting this - curious how you all would go about it, what questions you would ask, would reach out to HR?\n    submitted by    /u/PowPowPowerCrystal  \n [link]   [comments]",

I work on infrastructure and automation for my team in a niche industry and was hired about a year ago to design a tool for data ingestion that takes some documenation and manual test procedures, parses them into a database, and automates them. \n Over the last year I implemented most of the functionality, did some A/B testing, collected user stories, and got feedback from the other devs, etc. Things seem to be going over well.\n But last month we get a new dev from another team, two years out of college. He is smart and capable, but seems to be out to prove something. Unprompted by anyone he decides my implementation is shit, refactors half of it, and glues on a new front end. He makes a proposal to my manager who accepts the changes, and spends half the presentation just shitting on my work (without ever having spoken to me about any of it or seemingly aware that I was sitting right next to him).\n Granted his work itself is not bad and it addressed some pain points, but I was pissed at the unprompted changing of half the codebase that made half the docs and tests obsolete. He is getting alot of credit for my work as well as the core infrastructure still runs on my code, but the rest of the team seems to have forgotten about it. The only reason he could refactor anything is because I solved the technical challenges first. I was finally about to move on from this project, but now have to play catch up on all the technical debt he made. The way he made the proposal really got on my nerves too. \n Am I being too precious about my code? How am I supposed to react to this? I dont think he conciously meant to step on anyones toes and was just tunnel visioned on making improvements as engineers tend to do, but just the way he did all this without building any trust in his team first really rubbed me the wrong way.

He has superb communication skills, so despite the size of his contributions, he always manages to get recognition from stake-holders, this wasn't the culture of my previous team, on which we were low profile and respected the ownership and expertise of other members.\n This new culture has become a bit uncomfortable as I'm not used to fight my way to lead the few projects available.

Therefore, I've decided to create /r/ukdevs.\n My goal is for the community to be aimed at working developers who are based in the UK to talk about experiences, problems, the job market, contracting, etc. It's not really aimed at people who are learning to program for the first time - hence I thought there might be some in this sub who are interested, due to a similar audience.\n Mods (/u/snowe2010 , /u/drewsiferr, /u/teerre), I wonder if it would be possible to have this community listed in the related subs section of the sidebar?\n    submitted by    /u/NotTreeFiddy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I noticed that half of the people left during his part as he was yapping.\n I think one reason for this is his lack of understanding of the topic he is presenting, thus he is using a lot of filler words and buzzwords just to keep talking. I actually emphasise with that as I sometimes do that if i am not confident in what I am presenting, but not to that extent.\n Yapping also happens often during client calls when he needs to explain his work. It is evident that clients get confused, but everyone is polite and just lets him talk.\n Have you had experience with dealing with people like this. How do you provide feedback so it doesn’t sound accusatory. I don’t feel comfortable with providing feedback out of the blue as he doesn’t report to me. Perhaps I shouldn’t care about it in the first place, but I do find this behaviour irritating \n In the next feedback cycle I will write a feedback saying that this person would benefit from learning how to be more concise in the meetings. A good approach would be to record a demo and watch it back and answer the question “if I was watching this demo on youtube for learning purposes, would I find it engaging”.

I don't think I've been doing a very good job so far, but this is the first time I'm shouldering so much stuff at the same time.\n In fact I've never had to be directly responsible for the complete feature(incl. front-end) before, it was always just the backend code for me.\n My team lead has stepped in at this point because I just couldn't hack it.\n I'm also not entirely sure that this is what I imagined a senior engineer role to be like. I expected to stay in my lane(backend engineering) but just do more of it, handle more complicated backend problems, mentor more junior backend devs, coordinate between multiple backend teams - and I HAVE been doing all of that relatively successfully; but I never expected to have to sit down with a client dev and break their work into chunks and estimate it.\n What's going on?

However, during the nights and weekends at my current job, I've been running a side project that has gotten out of hand. I've scaled it to nearly 500k users and will do around $330k gross revenue this year. I haven't paid myself yet though, as I'm pumping everything into ads and contractors. With that being said, I don't want to go full time as I'm just not willing to accept the risk right now (my first kid is arriving in August). \n I've also been looking to change positions here soon to something a bit lower stress. I'm wondering if you'd include the side gig on your resume / in interviews or just focus on the day job. I'm worried the side gig will make me look less dedicated to my day job or like I'll bail at the first opportunity if it continues to grow...\n    submitted by    /u/okawei  \n [link]   [comments]",

A 15YOE replacement was hired and it was immediately obvious they could only deliver at a junior level. I advised the manager to get rid of them before their probation period was up. They wanted to give them a chance to improve, which hasn’t come to fruition. Once they pass probation, you can’t fire people without cause in my country.\n Start of the year, budget cuts happen and the remaining two seniors (who were contractors) have their contract ended. A fresh grad devops engineer is recruited. Team now consists of: myself as lead, mid with ~6YOE, junior with ~3YOE, junior with 15YOE, junior with ~0.5YOE.\n I’m getting smashed from all sides. Interacting with the business, being the sole senior engineer, handling a lot of the devops work since it’s moderately complex and a fresh grad is way over their head here. I’d hoped the mid level would rise up but it’s becoming clear that mid level could potentially be their peak. Struggling to keep the lights on let alone have time to grow the other members. Recent feedback from the engineers is that they need cards to have more detail for implementation (which is part of my role) so I feel like I am struggling to perform my core responsibility.\n Recent restructuring has brought in a new manager who asked if I want to go back to being an IC. Do I throw in the towel and wait for an opportunity with better support to dip my toes into the leadership path again? Or continue; but focussing on my core roles and letting the cracks I’ve been papering over widen?\n    submitted by    /u/hallucinogen_  \n [link]   [comments]",

If the player, plays the \"free\" version long enough , the game converts itself to the regular no ads version. Or would give you somehow access to the regular one like with steam keys etc.\n So players can choose to either pay or watch ads for a while. I know that many games are always \"free\" but with ads and allow the players to remove them for a fee. But I think it would be nice to just release the player at some point from this ad torture.\n I don't have much experience as game dev so maybe this question sounds really stupid, because it would take a very very long time to pay the game price (maybe 10$) by including ads into the game. \n Can you share your knowledge please? ^\n    submitted by    /u/Remove__  \n [link]   [comments]",

We were fine with that, as we made a product that we loved, and were happy to finish the project.\n On January 29th the unexpected happened, a promotional video actually performed well. It got 300k views, and led to 4k wishlists in just the few days prior to release. Release day we had over 1000 people play, which is more than we thought would ever play our game. We got dozens of positive reviews which gave us motivation to continue development. A couple months later, Smii7y played our game, and the player count spiked once again. 9000 people played the day his video released, and our player count has been higher than release day ever since. We have had over 140,000 people play our game, and that number continues to rise as we continue to develop and promote the game.\n This is just a reminder to never give up, and to follow your dreams!\n    submitted by    /u/supersoslox  \n [link]   [comments]",

To be fair I did try making a button on Godot, since I figured that'd be very important in my game (which will mostly revolve around UI), however I got miserably lost in it, and didn't do anything at first. Probably better to start with some videos...\n Anyways, this is just a post to hold myself accountable, I hope I'm not violating the rules of the sub. My idea is to make monthly uptades about my progress, like some public diary (but monthly) for me to see the progress and pressure myself into actually making it.\n    submitted by    /u/Jay_OA_10  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi Gamedevs,\n TLDR: Is my skillset to narrow for starting an indie studio? Similar stories?\n I'm an AAA inhouse dev having working on many big titles over the past 20 years. My current title is principal concept artist but I've worked as both Lead and AD on smaller projects prior to this and I've been working almost exclusively in 2D.\n I'm approaching 40 years on this planet and I've been thinking to myself that if I ever want to start a studio then now's the time. I attended a game school many years ago where we made 8 small games in 5 man teams during the 2 years I spent there. I also picked up the basics of 3d modelling, animation etc and this small scale day-to-day problem solving where you never really know what you have to solve the next day is something I miss in my current work situation.\n The doubts that I'm facing when trying to plan this out is that even with my extensive knowledge of art it feels like I wouldn't be able to contribute much in a more indie setting - realistically I can pull together 2-5 other good people of various disciplines but personally I have ZERO programming experience, I have very little in-engine experience since my focus has always been artistic vision and guiding others, I can create passable 3d models but I'm not a great 3D modeler outside of the things I do for Concepts and Illustration.\n I have looked at a bunch of tutorials on visual scripting in Unity etc. and I really like building shaders and geometry nodes in Blender - but truth be told - I often have to rely on tutorials to get me through my brain has never had to work with logic and math in any meaningful way before.\n My question is, with my background coming mostly from bigger sized team (100-700+) I've developed a skillset that is pretty niche, is there any point in even trying to start a smaller studio when I know I have very little knowledge working in those sized team? Has anyone here made a similar journey and can share some tips or stories?\n O\n    submitted by    /u/Reksawoscar  \n [link]   [comments]",

(For context it's a super grindy (but non-ai) open world text game which I hope will offer years of gameplay).\n But I'm finding that knowing how all the mechanics work under the covers, the bosses, the special moves etc. kind of sucked the fun (and mystique?) out of actually playing the game. I mean, making the game is still fun, and I've had test players who report positively on the game, but seems like I've catch 22'd myself, since this was something that I wanted to play myself.\n *Not sure why comments are not showing on this post, I assume once a mod unlocks them I can read everyone's responses.\n    submitted by    /u/TinyTextOdyssey  \n [link]   [comments]",

As terms of my continued employment, I must sign an inventions clause saying this new company owns any invention I make of any form at any time during my employment (outside of work). Not just video games. Comic books. Movies. Recipes. Anything. I find this highly, comically unethical, so I am not going to sign. I was told if I don't sign, that will count as \"resigning\", which is BS because I'm not resigning.\n This matters because if I resign, I am not owed severance. But I am not resigning. In my mind, if they want my employment to end because I don't consent to such a draconian state being forced on me due to a purchase, then I think they should have to terminate me without cause and give severance.\n So my questions are:\n 1.) Are these types of clauses even enforceable? Really? ANYTHING I work on?\n 2.) Can they legally decide that I implicitly resign with some sort of trap card? This is like my opponent moving my piece in chess. How is that allowed? I'm not resigning; you can't just say that you interpret an action I don't take as resigning and make that legally count -- right?\n https://imgur.com/a/PeJA5ug\n    submitted by    /u/wallthehero  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was able to do really well with just 1 week of work, but during that time I got 0 physical exercise and basically ate almost no food.\n I have a fear that if I don't go all-in, my games will never be good enough. But my opinion is that my relaxed best is going to have to be good enough, because I could literally cause myself to die if I try what I did over the past week again a few more times. If my game isn't good enough, I have to be OK with that. And I have to be OK with other people thinking my games are shit (in the ever-fluctuating comparisons). Because maybe they'll always be shit, no matter how much work I put in, and I only have one life to live, so I can't spend it trying to be something that I may never actually be able to achieve.\n    submitted by    /u/GrimnirTheHoodedOne  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm sure \"Protagonist Syndrome\" has some other meaning but for my case here, the definition I'm giving it is: Since the player is in control of the character, the player's actions should effect the ending of the game. This goes for games that really don't need multiple endings.\n Recently, while brainstorming ideas for games, I keep spiraling down this hole that has the same rocky bottom: I think the game(s) should have multiple endings depending on the player's actions. Of course, in some cases, this could be fun and add some replayabilty. However, I don't want every one of my games to be like this. It's nice to have a single playthrough that ties everything in a nice little package. I think my issue is that my brain convinces me that the player's actions should have a meaningful impact on the story because the player controls the very thing that is experiencing the story: the character.\n In other mediums, I feel this is much easier to avoid. When you watch a show, you are witnessing the events happen to the characters in the show. However, in games, those events happen to you, the player. \n Does any body else feel this while brainstorming ideas? If so, how do you work around this?

Most of the requests I receive on Fiverr tend to be very ambitious that usually require a team of people to work on them instead of just one person, which usually leads to me declining and explaining that I'm unable to make something like that in a reasonable timeframe as one man. I also separately have in my description that I only make prototypes, so they generally don't include finished environments or animations (unless it's crucial for the prototype or if it helps to visualize the functionality better). Still, I get a ton of requests via dms to make almost a full game with animations, environments, and even some triple A game mechanics, which tends to take too much time or is too ambitious for what's reasonable for an indie developer. I generally try to limit the time I spend on a single order to 1-3 weeks depending on how complex it is but a lot of the requests I get would take at least a few months to make if I only were to focus on that specific order which is impossible since I tend to have other orders I'm working on at the same time. I'm just here to complain because it tends to get frustrating at times since these types of requests seem to be almost half of the dms I receive on Fiverr. Can other freelancers here relate and how do you deal with it?\n    submitted by    /u/Global-Notice-7707  \n [link]   [comments]",

In half a year, learn the hardship of being a woman in a class dominated by men and now i wonder will it always be this way?\n In my own class rooms I don’t feel safe, men have harassed me, a guy got close to me face to face wise and put his hand down his pants to you know where while keeping eye contact with me. I had men who I’m supposed to work with on projects leave me out and call me a “sim player.” (Reference to girls only playing the sims) I had men get angry at me when I help them with there coding or nodes. I been followed and insulted, I been cat called by classmates too. Now it’s not just the men but also the woman too, as a woman who likes coding, video games, etc. it was kinda difficult to find other female friend who liked what I liked, but now I’m too scared to talk to any of them. I had girl say she doesn’t like girly girly with purses, meaning me bc I like my purse (it has a corgi on it)on the first day she was boasting about how she the only woman in a class of men, I have short hair plus I want keeping to myself at the time, but she said that she was happy she was the only woman because other woman are too girly for her, when the professor pointed me out, let’s just say the death glare was definitely felt. I had girls that dismiss me and try to talk over me. and girls who see me as competition in the class and try to one up me on stuff.\n I have heard stories of woman in the industry having problems with getting jobs, coworkers, and work. I won’t lie I thought it never happen to me and that I’ll make friends with my peers but I was wrong.

Lately I've seen a huge rise in \"How to escape tutorial hell videos\" and while at first it made me feel better by helping me identify the situation I was in, after seen like 10+ videos I've gotten on my recommended over time to see what other tips people might have , they all pretty much say the same thing which is mostly \"just stop an make something yourself\" or how to \"watch tutorials effectively\", which seems a bit unfair when you're still at square 1 not knowing what you don't know you need to learn.\n So as said in the title, what does it mean to leave tutorial hell?\n Is it to never gaze your eyes upon a piece of gamedev content and just sit down, open unity and visual studio and pull out Eric Legyen's Foundations of game engine development volume 1 out my butt?\n Or is it to plan out the 27 part how to make an RPG playlist by myself and just look up things as I encounter them like \"okay so I need to move the player character in 4 directions\" or \"hmm.. I wonder how I can subtract health using a sort of trigger?\"and then look it up learning those pieces of information bit by bit as you need them?\n Sorry for the long rant, I've been holding this in for a while now, thanks a lot if you took the time to read and respond.\n    submitted by    /u/Aiden2959  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's not just because there are more games released each year, it's also because of a new Steam appeal system. Before this system, you needed to register in February to be able to participate in June. Now, you can pretty much decide to participate whenever you want and you'll most likely be accepted.\n But there is more to that, and it's far more concerning. Some popular games gets to participate twice while Steam says it's ONE Next Fest (ever).\n I'll take the example of Aloft, a game currently taking of the top slots of Next Fest.\n Well, guess what? Aloft was already participating in June 2022 edition! Here is proof:\n https://youtu.be/LeJyt79sBQU?si=ZZ…",

Especially in certain genres like action rpgs for example, I want to see the skill tree, what classes are available, their abilities, cool effects on weapons and equipment, but instead of dedicating even a single screenshot to one of the game's systems, it's only art.\n Are studios afraid of pushing away players who might be intimidated by these things? And if so why cater to the people who are more likely to refund and write a bad review once they realize they don't like the systems that were kept hidden from them rather than fans of their game's genre who would actually enjoy the systems if they knew about them? There are so many games I skip by that could be perfect for me but I don't want to spend time doing extra research and looking through a gameplay vid on youtube.\n Edit: I do recognize skill trees were a bad example and the complexity there could turn players away, but I am more referring to showing any core system the game has to offer beyond art style and cinematography\n    submitted by    /u/CzechMateQQ  \n [link]   [comments]",

In 2021 I started a game studio with my friend from university and we released our first game in 2022. Most of the funding for our development came from various grants and out of our own pockets. We thought that maybe some publishers or investors would be interested in our next game, but right now, as you might know, the industry is struggling and most studios have to figure out how to stay afloat and don't want to take any chances.\n Now we're about to release and self-publish our second title this July, but we don't have the numbers we wanted. Our biggest hope was Steam Next Fest, but with over 2000 other games attending right now, the chances of our game getting much attention aren't great... Our numbers for our game are around 3500 wishlists before Steam Next Fest, which doesn't seem like much, but it was a lot of work to get there, especially without a viral video or much marketing experience. Maybe there is someone out there who can relate to this situation and have some advice or words of encouragement because we could really use some right now.\n I will attach some graphs and a link to the game for context in the comments.\n    submitted by    /u/Yellik1307  \n [link]   [comments]",

To parallel that, I want to put stuff in my game with the primary purpose of it never being found. These things wouldn’t have sort of huge lore relevance, nor would they be required to find in order to beat the game. They would just be there to deepen the theme of the unknown. I wouldn’t be surprised if players found some of them, but my goal is to make it impossible to find every secret within the game.\n I completely understand that putting something completely functional in a game that isn’t like developer-tools related is arguably bad game design and really weird to do, but I think i would be thematically fitting.\n My biggest question is well, how do I hide it? There are dataminers out there, and i feel like just datamining all of the secrets would sort of ruin the point im trying to come across. I understand it’s impossible to hold back dataminers forever but I definitely want to make the secrets nearly impossible to find within the code, and maybe just make it frustrating overall to datamine. I understand that the chances of someone datamining a game is relatively low, but once again, don’t want these things to be found, or at least not easy to find.\n The obvious answer would just be to not put it in the game entirely, but i still want these things to be theoretically achievable just so cryptic it is nigh impossible.

It would be fun to spend time/know people that share the hobby/interest of developing games. \n How do you do it?\n    submitted by    /u/Tom-Dom-bom  \n [link]   [comments]",

(It runs fine on my computer). Is there a setting in my visual studio to turn that off? Does windows not like the raw .EXE? It's a simple game that's written in C with Allegro. It's only a single statically linked .exe. The game itself is a \"work toy\" like a fidget spinner you have at your desk at work. It's a little micro RPG that plays itself, but you can poke at it when you are bored. The idea is you can play from anywhere-- I even included a \"boss key\" like in the old days that turns it into a little digital clock.. Do I really have to wrap it in an installer or something to make it secure? I really don't want to do that as I would like to keep it so you can run it from anywhere.

We're trying to get a larger audience for our next game, and I've been considering streaming and doing YouTube, but the issue is really that the games are intended for an adult audience, so naturally my reach is very limited. How have other devs of adult games managed to still gain some traction despite this?\n Naturally, places like Twitch and YouTube would be a good start, but I'm not sure that the effort I put into there will automatically be kneecapped and shadow-banned, even if the content is not necessarily explicit. I might even just be barking up the wrong tree, or maybe I'm just not in the right social spaces where I would market this kind of game. Any advice would be really helpful.

Additionally, if the in-game crafting recipe uses household ingredients (the game is set in a city), is that potentially more legal trouble I could be inviting?\n If someone plays my game, then later creates that dangerous material for real, am I possibly culpable for them doing that, and if so do I need to purposefully obscure the references to real-world materials or even have unrealistic/fictional materials instead?\n Regardless of answers given, I aknowledge that none of the comments provided here qualify as legal counsel.\n    submitted by    /u/CenatoryDerodidymus  \n [link]   [comments]",

That's a time savings of 13%, or a speed increase of 15%. \n I've compiled a lot of games over the years. It always brings all cores up to a full 100% workload for almost the whole process no matter the engine. I've always suspected that, in those cases, hyperthreading might actually be slowing my computer down since it isn't needed if the cores are truly at 100% anyway, and that the computational and thermal overhead produced by hyperthreading isn't necessary in those situations. I never got around to testing it because, honestly, I figured I was probably wrong.\n I finally tested it yesterday. I have a fairly large game project in GameMaker. I cleaned and built it four times with hyperthreading still on and the average time was 4:36 (all were close). I then disabled hyperthreading in my bios and tested four more times. The average was 4:00 flat.\n This is with the following system:\n i7-12700k\n 32 GB DDR4 3200\n WD_BLACK SN850 NVMe SSD\n I suspect other engines would also see a speed increase. Since compile times are a huge part of the game dev process, you might want to test the same thing using a project with your computer/engine. Even a 15% speed increase can add up, and it's free.\n    submitted by    /u/TimPrice2  \n [link]   [comments]",

By 2015 I’d visit this sub regularly, mainly for marketing tips. “Top 10 ways to market your indie game” type posts were my favourite.\n We launched into Early Access in December 2017 out of the long defunct Steam Greenlight programme with 18,000 wishlists. That was enough to get us to the big carousel on the front page of Steam at the time. Everything’s very different now. There are more games, better tools, so many more freely available resources like tutorials, and indies generally seem way more marketing savvy. I’m quite relieved we got in there when we did though, I think we’d struggle a lot more starting out now. It definitely still looks possible though; I’m looking forward to the next project.\n I just wanted to say thanks for the help. This sub is a great source of information, and reassurance when things aren’t going quite to plan.\n There's a little post here about how we almost didn't make the game, banging our head against the kickstarter: https://imgur.com/gallery/fArGK7j\n    submitted by    /u/LiamSlugdisco  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd assume many here has read that article.\n To sum it up for those who haven't: the moment a game gets 10 reviews, it not only gets an \"official score\" (like \"Mostly positive\" or \"Mixed\") but also gets WAY more visibility on Steam for a few days.\n Now, one thing that isn't mentioned in the above article is if the \"10 review-effect\" is also happening when the game has already been around for a long time (like mine).\n Another gamedev told me that their game didn't get any noticeable increase in traffic when, after one year, they got their tenth review by a paying customer.\n So, I was wondering: has any small-scale dev here been in my situation, waiting for that tenth review, hoping for a boost in traffic, and then getting it/not getting it?

I'd like to give the experience I had with the system after approximately two weeks of running my own playtest through steam.\n To Start\n On around May 22nd, I put up my game on Steam Playtest.

I definitely learned a ton from the process. I built my own framework in JavaScript + React + Electron, which is something I haven't done before. I learned how to integrate into Steam and build something from start to finish (which is something I REALLY struggled with). \n I know everyone loves numbers, so I wanted to provide a few for those who find it interesting. To date, I've sold about 4,400 copies of my game, with currently 4K wishlists. That's about $13.4K in gross revenue and about $9380 is what I see of that. Of that amount, I'm saving about $2345 (~25% of what I earned) for taxes. I think that's about $7K I actually…",

I feel like the game is now a much different product than what it was 3 years ago when it was first released, with a ton more features and contents included in the base game (not counting the contents added in the six DLCs). \n Also since the game has been out for three years, most of the videos/screenshots people have been sharing are of the \"old looks\", so I'd love to distinguish from that.\n Now that I feel like I am done updating this game and ready to move on to the sequel, I wonder whether it makes sense to give the game a new \"identity\" by calling it XXXX: XXXXX Enhanced Edition. Do you think this is a good idea, or has this practice been used too much in the gaming industry?

One in perticular that still makes me chuckle is telling us we'd failed as game devs because we insisted we should include a mouse sensitivity slider for our game. We were told that the mouse sensitivity should be perfect! and no one should have any need to adjust their mouse sensitity for the game.\n We had to explain that people prefer different mouse sensitivities and not one setting fits everyone. We had a perfect example among our dev team. Me using a edpi of around 2400 and another developer using a edpi of around 400. Needless to say we were never allowed to add a mouse sensitivity slider because according to that senior staff member we were wrong in thinking we needed one. The company is now closed down.\n In general it was like they hated the idea of giving the player any way of changing anything in options, and this is only one example.

I can confidently say it had no impact whatsoever. I did get a huge spike in direct navigation, but the sales yesterday were actually at some of the lowest of the week. I saw someone say in the comments \"I can't buy it because it costs 100.000\". Which translates to $3.7. The normal price of the game is $7 in USA. This is Steam's auto conversion which they recommend. I suppose this is a Vietnamese thing, but still so strange to see literally no one buy it when the youtuber is having a great time.\n Edit: As a commentor said, Steam is currently banned in Vietnam. I'm devastated.\n Edit2: People told me to put the name and link in the post.

          "description": "Take the most simple idea you can possibly imagine.\n Simplify it more, it's still way too complicated.\n Don't start from making art. Do a playable prototype using most basic 2d or 3d shapes. Gameplay first. There are some exceptions, but this approach wouldn't hurt them either.\n Make sure the prototype you've made is good enough to reflect your desired gameplay on 80-90%.\n After - look at your prototype with a very new look, and think once again of the MOST simple art style that could represent your idea \"well enough\". Replace simple shapes with some assets. Don't be afraid of using Assetstore or other places to buy/get your assets if they fit. No-one really cares about their originality as long if it fits and it's fun.\n Register pages for all important social media the day you start. Post everything you do there, start getting some followers. Remember, making a game is always much longer process then you expect, the game you want to make in 2 weeks may take 2 month, may take 2 years. Before you finish - you'll have some audience to start with. If you start late - you will regret not starting at once. It will take months of daily posting just to make it a habit, so it's much better to start at day 1.\n The hardest thing in making a game is 'completing and releasing' it. Make this your main goal and priority. Everything else goes second.\n  \np.s. This strategy works not only for the 1st game, but I'd stick to it in general.

          "description": "(Unsure if this is the correct flair)\n After having built a 3D bullet hell in GDScript, spending almost as much time doing optimizations as I spent on programming the prototype, and now building a similar prototype in C# using the physics / rendering server...I can't think of any reason to NOT statically type your GDScript code.\n Static typing not only makes it significantly easier to debug but has notable performance boosts across the board. As someone who comes from a Java/C++ background, I also personally feel it brings *a bit* more professional credibility to GDScript as a language.\n I did a side-by-side optimization comparison test that directly accesses the Physics/Rendering 3D server to create 3000 bullets in GDScript and C#. Statically typed GDScript was only about 10% FPS slower than the C# version.\n Yet the overwhelming majority of YouTube tutorials and code posted on this subreddit use dynamically typed GDScript. Any particular reason why static typing isn't the default when it only appears to have benefits over dynamically typed GDScript?\n Curious on everyone's thoughts - for those programming in GDScript , do you enforce static typing in your code?\n UPDATE:\n Thanks to everyone for your input and insight! Didn't realize the subject of static typing was so polarizing.\n For anyone interested, here is the github link to the optimization test using the PhysicsServer3D and RenderingServer to spawn 3000 objects, written in static typed GDScript:\n https://github.com/vgscreenwriter/Godot-PhysicsServer3D-Test\n Godot version 4.2.2, Jolt3D physics engine\n    submitted by    /u/vgscreenwriter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "10 days ago i released my first game on steam and i always said i want to make 92 Euros with it. Thats exact the amount the Steam page for the game costs me. The game itself did not cost me anything but my time. And game development is my hobby. So everything is fine and i dont want to get rich. Seeing others like my game is good enough.\n So, i did not do much marketing activities and got like 50 wishlists in the ~4 weeks between publishing the steam page and releasing the game. So i got a few sales and was very happy. I also got very early 2 positive reviews and the first one was really good and made me proud. It was some youtuber dude wo made a very positive video about it. and i never heard of him before, it was really random and i dont know how he found our about my game. Did i tell you, i was proud and happy? :) i was sure, the 92 Euros would not be a problem and i already had 12 sales :D\n Yeah, no problem. Everything is nice...\n Until the refunding start and 50% of the sales got refunded until now. and every sale maybe is still refundable because of the 14 days refund policy.\n Some refunding players gave reasons like..\n - \"low framerate\": i tested my game on an old potato low budget laptop and it worked absolutely smooth on that thing that was 5 years ago the cheapest windows laptop on the market, no joke! Even my mothers low budget smarphone runs it at an acceptable speed.\n - \"game does not match screenshots and trailer\": i dont get that. the trailer shows in every second 100% recorded gameplay and also the screenshots are real screenshots.\n Thats a little bit frustrating. Do you other game devs have made similar experiences?\n i know my game makes more fun when played with/against humans, but thats an hen and egg problem..\n If you want to have a look, my game is called \"Pyradice\". https://store.steampowered.com/app/2957200/Pyradice/\n    submitted by    /u/PristineBobcat9608  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "It's an infinite loop: you crave making a game, you start developing something, you get bored or burnt out, you stop. I was really enjoying the process, I like making games and I like using Godot, but then yet again I stopped. This time I reflected a bit and I understood why it happened. Apparently I don't have a clear goal. I start to think about \"why should I make this game, there are thousands better than mine\". I make games since I was 14 (now I'm 32) and when I was younger it was very easy for me working consistently to a game, indeed I released several games. The simple \"I just want to make a game because yes\" worked at that time. Now it doesn't work anymore and the lack of a reason, something to achieve for having developed a game makes me lose the direction and the beauty of creating something. Does it happens to you too? Should I simply give up making games? (I can't, after some times I inevitably come back making games 🫤) Do you have any suggestion?\n    submitted by    /u/fuck---spez  \n [link]   [comments]",

We’re aiming to maintain the compatibility with the existing community-driven plugin. Last but not least, the Godot support plugin is set to be bundled with Rider in the 2024.2 release.\n  \nThis is fantastic news, and more proof that Godot is well on the way to being acknowledged as a first class engine alongside the usual Unity & Unreal duo.\n PS: Jetbrains IDE are paid software but the EAP (early access program) will allow you to use the early access version for free!

Any feedback and suggestions would be greatly appreciated, especially in regards to advancing the obfuscation and evasion mechanisms. If you wanna play around with it the pre built release is on github along with the source, here: (Art3misRAT Github). Note that the ip is set to 127.0.0.1 in the release so it will only work on local machine, if you wanna connect to a remote ip you'll have to build from source. Hoping to evolve it into a free tool for the community with enough useful features, but primarily to evade AV detection since Meterpreter seems to be very difficult to get past windows defender lately. Hope yall like it and any feedback is greatly appreciated! Edit: Use it responsibly and legally!\n    submitted by    /u/MyCelluloidScenes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am working on a project involving the Walabot, a device typically used for detecting structures within walls. My application, however, is a bit more complex—I create and stitch together heatmaps of objects through various materials using the Walabot. The original version of the device would tether over USB and didn't require any fancy interfacing. \n The newer, wireless model of Walabot I’m using generates its own Wi-Fi access point named \"Walabot_40XXXXX2,\" but it's secured with a WPA2 Personal password, the app starts and finds said network and after a second or two begins to communicate and stream data the Walabot.\n The support team has been unclear or unable to understand my request, telling me its's \"not open source\" when asking for the WPA2 password. My thought is that it might unfortunately be using some type of rolling WPA code or that its generated per connection by making requests against some kind of backend.\n My first thought had been to try and intercept the communication with a wifi bridge running on a raspberry pi between the Walabot and the Phone with a pair of the RTL8821AU USB adapters I have and hopefully capture the password being transmitted, but I can't authenticate so that doesn't seem the workable.\n I know I am overthinking this, any software or hardware recommendations that could simplify this process?\n    submitted by    /u/borillionstar  \n [link]   [comments]",

They were made a local admin by a group policy applied to all end-user workstations \n So you are ready to take over the network, except...\n \n The same group policy also gives them \"Deny access to this computer from the network\" everywhere. \n So you can't move laterally with just this account, but maybe you're going to harvest their password to at least elevate on other workstations you have a non-elevated foothold on?\n \n No password was used; smart card is required for interactive logon. \n But maybe you can do something with their NTLM secret at least?\n \n They are in the \"Protected Users\" group and cannot authenticate with NTLM.\n  \nThe best I can think of is you might be able to steal their PIN out of the LSA if credential guard is not enabled, and maybe whip up some custom method of proxying the smart card to another host, but that might be tough to implement given that the account's only value is local admin and if you can install a tampered smartcard driver on the destination machine, you were already local admin.\n Am I missing something? I only ask because many people have said the only fully safe way for a technician to be able to elevate to local admin on an end-user device is by looking up and typing a complex LAPS password, and if that's true, this alternative (a smart card with a dedicated in-person-only admin account) must be broken somehow.\n    submitted by    /u/PowerShellGenius  \n [link]   [comments]",

Wouldn’t they hold more information that could be sensitive? I’m sure it would open a whole different can of worms in terms of internet security though. I’d imagine an ISP has different security conventions as opposed to any other randomly picked company.\n I just feel like if a malicious party really wanted to do damage, they wouldn’t focus on companies like Sony or whatever. I mean you gotta know once you’ve gone that far there’s no going back, and if you get caught it’s likely life in prison. So go for broke?\n Has this been done before? Why do you think cyber criminals focus on other businesses instead of ISP’s? Just curious is all. Always kinda wondered how secure an ISP was anyways, considering companies like Apple use services like Private Relay now. Is there a need for better security on the ISP’s end?

I have an image that supposedly has a hidden message. I've tried using exiftool, strings, DiiT, /stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/, http://futureboy.us/stegano/, steghide, stegcracker (i currently have a python script running as I'm trying to brute force the passphrase since we weren't given one), and I just dont know where to go from here. I don't think I'm able to attach the actual image file here (or I'm just too sleep deprived to see it which is the most likely case).

I would like to complete this data using the correct data for this moment which still exists in the mkv file.\n I have already extracted the necessary video/audio data from the mkv. From what I see, the audio in the mp4 is inserted in blocks without any additional data, but unfortunately the video blocks are preceded by some preliminary data that I will have to recreate somehow. This is probably some data resulting from the structure of the mp4 file, but I will have to look for this information.\n Is there a free hex editor that will allow me to visually separate these video/audio blocks while I work? For example, so that I can mark and then find their beginnings and ends and easily jump between them, or to easily compare the contents of two shorter blocks that are not next to each other in the data sequence.\n Currently, I use the HxD editor, but here I work with the one block of entire data, without any visual selection options, which is why I often get lost in it.\n    submitted by    /u/Lexard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I found a bunch of unknown devices on my wifi network. The apartment I live in has wifi they pay for as part of a package, but I have my own account. I called Spectrum and they gave me a Mac address for the main unknown device which was coming from a Belkin_ext router. What I noticed:\n My wifi signal (MINE) and the signal for Belkin_ext were the same strength as I walked around the property. \n When I looked at the belkin_ext router info on the wifi settings list, the Mac address was the same for the mystery devices that had been previously connected. They matched. This is new to the apartment and mine is close to the office. \n I blocked new devices from entering and changed my password and name. Then 3 devices were blocked from connecting (apple and Lenovo pc). \n This whole thing started when I reported illegal activity in the complex to the property manager (Charged with ID THEFT but didn't jail time). \n I suspect cameras or bugs, and an RF detector picked up from only one outlet. But I cant find anything in there when pulled out...\n I am really stumped how I can prove this. Does anyone have advice? She has a personal vendetta against me for no valid reason. I'd love some of your help in making sure I take correct measures to police. And making sure it's HER. I can't see her router but maybe I can see something on the public lounge computer. \n Thank you!!!\n    submitted by    /u/Planit4Squad  \n [link]   [comments]",

For an assignment I have a list of password hashes along with a hint of what they could be. In this case the first set of passwords are a kaiju followed by three digits and a single lowercase letter with an MD5 hash applied to them. The second set off passwords are a basic color (think crayola basic 12 set teachers words not mine) followed by a kaiju name and these are a SHA-1 hash. I was able to get one password from the first set and I was able to get 4 passwords from the second set. l've been coming up with wordlist after wordlist but nothing else has cracked and l've been wracking my brain for the past 3 days. If anyone is willing to offer some advice it would be hugely appreciated. Also l've been using hash-identifier, hashcat, as well as Johnny for this assignment, and I think l've got the basics down for how they work\n    submitted by    /u/Starthelegend  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hospitals in London have had to cancel cancer operations this week because of a Russian cyber-attack that continues to cause serious disruption to NHS services in the capital.\n  \nCancer surgeries delayed: St Thomas’ and King’s College hospitals have been forced to postpone cancer operations due to the cyberattack. This critical delay is because the attack crippled their ability to provide blood transfusions, a vital procedure during many cancer surgeries.\n Widespread disruption across NHS services: The attack goes beyond these two major hospitals. It's impacting six NHS trusts and dozens of GP practices in southeast London, affecting millions of people's care. This disruption includes cancelled appointments and likely extends beyond just blood-related procedures.\n Lack of transparency causing unease: While NHS England acknowledges the attack and its impact, they haven't released details on the number of cancelled operations, including critical procedures like transplants. This lack of transparency is causing frustration and unease among both staff and likely patients who are unsure about the status of their appointments.\n  \nDr Chris Streather, the medical director for NHS England’s London region, said : “We are sorry to all those who have been impacted and staff will work hard to re-arrange appointments and treatments as quickly as possible.”\n Source (The Guardian)\n    submitted by    /u/Used-Bat3441  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n I hope this is ok to post. I am a penetration tester, and I have a specific requirement right now for my job. My team is currently doing security-requirement evaluation, and there is a requirement that talks about performing HTTP fuzzing on a device that does not act as a server; it is a bad requirement essentially.\n There is some belief within the team that we could try to fuzz one of the shared libraries (.so) that handles some of the lower-level HTTP logic, but it does not house code that is used for routing or anything like that.\n Personally, I'm not convinced that such a fuzzing tool even exists for this type of use case, but I want to make sure I cover my bases before discussing again within the team. I've spent ample time researching, and could not find anything pertinent.\n My question is, does anyone have any knowledge of such a tool? The use case is specifically HTTP binary fuzzing; not HTTP server fuzzing, and not general binary fuzzing.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Jackscalibur  \n [link]   [comments]",

We could use a dis assembler and mod the assembly serial check to not jump out of the code when a bad serial was entered. We could reassemble and enter anything into the serial and had a full working software. Oh, them days was fun. Then the software programmers became smarter and they started checking for the disassembler. A ugly prompt would open up saying the disassembler software being used could not be used. I was sad. It was fun for a while just to see how things worked. Then it became hard. Doh. \n    submitted by    /u/Silent_Cup2508  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm pretty sure this article is correct. For the past 30 years I've seen hordes of people flooding into tech. It used to be people would tell their kids to be a doctor or a lawyer. But for nearly my whole life they've been adding tech to that list. There are \"teach yourself programming\" resources everywhere and have been my whole life. \n And now the field is feeling pretty flooded. I post a job, I get hundreds of applications instantly. More than I could ever read. So most don't get read. I wish there was a way to close applications after X number so we don't waste people's time. Sorry, I can't hire you all. We're also paying lower than I ever thought we would, considering inflation etc. Especially if you consider outsourcing. There are folks out there who will write code for a bowl of rice. And you want to live in San Jose and make a living as a programmer? You had better be the next Steve Wozniak if you want to compete. The competition is amazingly intense. \n I think this article is right. We've hit \"peak programmer\". The market is weeding people out from now on as there aren't enough jobs world-wide as there are programmers world-wide and programming isn't likely to be any more lucrative than many other more mundane jobs due to supply and demand. \n My only recommendation is to get really good at some growing programming niche. Maybe become a rust expert. Or embedded systems/microcontrollers. \n We definitely don't need any more PHP/Java/Javascript programmers, that's for sure.\n    submitted by    /u/iheartrms  \n [link]   [comments]",

For context, we had a course on Python during our first year, but it was mostly the basic concepts that were introduced in that class.\n During one of the lab assignments, we were asked to write code for a bunch of functions that work recursively, as well as some linked list-related stuff. I got very good results in my previous labs (always one or two points away from 100%, if not 100% outright), but for this lab I got six whole marks deducted for code that worked perfectly fine. \n I know it works because I tested it thoroughly and had multiple problems with my previous solutions to the problems, and because the entire concept of recursion is new to me, I had some rather unconventional solutions for those. \n The question I have is, is it fair/normal/standard for professors and TAs to grade so harshly when the code is simply \"unoptimized\" to their eyes? There are NO compilation or runtime errors in any of the cases, and even though some things are not implemented in the best way, they do not create any memory leaks, dangling pointers or break general convention from what I was able to understand by taking this class. \n If anyone wants/needs screenshots of the code and the feedback I got from it to better understand what I'm asking, I can post those as well. \n    submitted by    /u/Comprehensive-Lie484  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Well I finally did it! I got paid to program after 1.5 years of learning web dev! I didn't get a full time job, but was offered two contracting jobs! Both gigs I got through friend connections.\n The first is just for a static site for a local business in my town and the site I built just went live. So I'm pretty pumped. Not only that, but after the site went live, the business is now asking me to help them with some of their clients websites moving forward so I'm hoping it's consistent work. \n The second is for a Java dev that wants me to build a website that'll host their app they are working on. This will be more in depth and require setting up a database, user creation, authentication, and payment processing. \n I would have never landed these gigs without my friends' connections. To get a programming job, learning to program is important (duh). But if you are struggling to break into the industry don't forget to leverage your network as well. You might not get a full time role this way, but who knows, maybe they know someone that needs help with their small local business or project. \n I hope that I get to see more posts about people landing roles - big or small!\n    submitted by    /u/oodtoon  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Now, I get that many programmers consider SQL to be too simple and noobish to be even considered a programming language. But of all languages, I think SQL stands out as not only one of the easiest to learn and practice, the sheer genius of this language is that it lets you do so much with so little expressiveness, while still trying to maintain standards across various kinds of databases as much as possible.\n With all their expressive tokens and syntaxes, languages like C and Java and Python are often appreciated and rightly so, but I think SQL also deserves a place up there in the list of \"do more with less jargon\" things out there. In fact, the four basic DML/DDL statements (create, insert, update, delete) are all you need to get started with creating tables and manipulating data on most projects. And learning additional features like alter, drop, truncate, etc. is both fun and interesting.\n And once you go even further with things like stored procedure and triggers, the real fun then begins! If you consider the below stored procedure of some hypothetical SQL dialect, it is no less elegant than any of the other popular expressive languages like Python or Ruby, don't you agree?\n create or replace procedure foo: begin select @test = select foo from bar; -- statement 2; -- statement 2; -- statement 3; end; \n    submitted by    /u/pyeri  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "It would be really helpful if someone can give me advice considering my situations. I'll be graduating by this year with a CS degree but I still know nothing about coding.\n I wasn't a good student from the beginning and in the second year I had a mental breakdown after facing so much failure in life and because of that I had a huge drop in the cgpa. I was living alone in the hostel and could't even share anything with my parents. But when I gave up on everything I finally decided to quit my life and finally show my grades to parents before that. It was one of the hardest decisions of my life, and when I showed my grades to my parents I saw my father cry for the first time in life. At that moment, I forgot everything and promised myself I'd become a better student and resettle the things I've done bad.\n Fast forward to 2024, I did become a good student, my grades came up, took studying seriously and gave the exams seriously. But as you all know uni teaching doesn't make you a better programmer so I am still not so much skillful to get a job.\n So, anyone reading this I'd really be so much blessed if you can show me or advice me a lerning path. My goal is to now restart the coding learning from basics, I am considering to start with CS50. Will that be a better choice? I want to learn the basics and master DSA in these few months and trynna enter Leetcode. Would this be a better approach or if you think there is faults in my plan.

          "description": "I recently came to the conclusion that old programming books are better than new ones. This will be preposterous to some and, I suspect, obvious to others. \n Old books are better because those that remain in the public consciousness are certified classics. They have withstood the tests of time, remaining relevant, which means they must have value of some kind. \n This value is two-fold. They either provide technical knowledge that has remained timeless or they provide valuable historical context, and the outdated technical knowledge can be overlooked. \n Historical context is not something that many people look for in programming books, but they should. Understanding the history of an idea helps us understand the idea in greater detail. Particularly, most of the history of computer science was driven by individuals who aimed to solve relevant problems within constraints. By understanding who these individuals were, the problems they were trying to solve, and the constraints they operated within, we are able to better understand the ideas and tools that were developed. \n For example, I would highly recommend The Design and Evolution of C++ by Bjarne Stroustroup. This book teaches history, philosophy, language building, low-level programming, and effective design in the context of C++, covering why and how it was developed. \n When you read old programming books, whether for technical know-how or historical facts, you begin to see that everyone involved was human. Everything in programming makes sense to humans because it was designed by humans. The pioneers who came before, although extremely talented, were humans like you or me, and this is a reassuring thought to remember. \n I would recommend reading old books, especially for beginners. They provide context in a seemingly context-less world and help to make sense of the complexity of programming. \n Hope this helps someone!\n    submitted by    /u/GenghisKharr  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm old and I got time so my progress is pretty slow. All I want to do eventually is post bloggy type things involving photos, doodles, and some music-y things I'm making. I'm learning completely solo so I don't have classmates to rant to!\n I've ruled out that I need python for now, but I've settled on Internetting is Hard and W3Schools for html/css education. On my own account I tried to download Jekyll because it sounded like it'd be helpful, and it may be, but it got me more familiar with 1) the Terminal, 2) VSCode, 3) Ruby, and 4) Homebrew and all of those things were terrifying to me before. Jekyll is enabling me to kind of see results of learning/tinkering a little faster than what I was doing before.\n Installing Jekyll through Terminal via Homebrew was such a cool learning experience.\n So why am I saying this is kind of a superpower? I'm also learning markdown elsewhere because certain programs like Notenik, Spaces, or Logseq use them, and it's a pretty nifty thing. Those types of programs are just helping me write better notes.\n And it hit me that ALL OF THIS IS JUST TEXT (duh that's what HTML is dude!) and it's just kind of amazing to me that you can build a whole valuable website and automate all sorts of things just by writing stuff out and placing it in the right spots. And the fact that it's just text files means it's super shareable, savable, and open. It's wild.\n Here and in other subreddits folks have been so helpful so I just wanted to write this out, if only for an affirmation.

I started learning swift since Feb and it's been on and off but the last 2 months l've been getting better at staying consistent, so a person I know wants an app for their private gym and I have been honest with them about my lack of experience but not completely to the point that I've never made a app before. I gave them a turn around time for about 5-6 months to make.\n I was thinking that I would use one month to just focus on all that l lack in my knowledge and use the rest to start developing the app and use Google as my best friend. My thought behind it was \"there is no way better to keep me committed and motivated than working on someone else's app and get paid for it, especially with the pressure\"\n Do you think this would be possible to do as a novice or have I bitten more than I can chew?\n Thanks guys\n    submitted by    /u/Degeneratecoder0101  \n [link]   [comments]",

And today i got one interview of Machine Learning Intern position at a place in eygpt where as i reside in India. I got into interview and it went really well i did have some experience/projects in python[Machine learning and Web development] to showcase so like the interviewer is impressed but at last he started telling me that \"so this is a small company this internship will cost you $20[₹1700] for the mentorship we provide. You have to build and give them two projects in 1 month tenure\" - exact words.\n So here i am confused about what to do, at first i thought it is a scam because though this was a unpaid internship i did sign up unwillingly but now they are want me to pay them. EDITED[Added] - 'And the second thought which comes in mind was this can be true because I don't about other countries but whenever I searched on LinkedIn and location in India for the internships there are number of internships which wants me to pay like $5[₹500-₹800]. They are just like distributing internships certificate and the tasks are like make a calculator. That's where i thought it can be real.'\n What are views on this should pay them and start or try another internship?\n Also if you can refer me some good internship, please show your kindness.\n    submitted by    /u/ketan_v_astro  \n [link]   [comments]",

So far, I've only written a couple of loops and a basic calculator in C by watching some tutorials. But I can't really follow tutorials; I get distracted, and my productivity plummets. A two-hour study topic takes me all day if I'm watching videos. I'm much more comfortable learning from books.\n So, I'm looking for a book on C that starts from the very basics, like setting up the programming environment in Ubuntu, and goes all the way to advanced concepts like OOP, pointers, data structures, algorithms, and so on. My plan is to start with C and then move on to C++, Java, Kotlin, and Python. Almost everyone suggests starting with C, so that's what I've decided to do.\n I need a book that begins at the ground level but eventually covers advanced topics. It should also include problem sets and their solutions to help me grasp programming fundamentals.

A lot of those newcomers are probably gonna try, fail and ditch the OS for Windows.\n I say there should be a disclaimer on linux subreddits that Linux is not a substitute for Windows etc, because I feel bad for the guys who say basically the same stuff on every single one of those posts.\n Whether the market share will increase or not is yet know, but it doesn't look promising to me.

I hope it's not too out of place.\n My dad was a huge linux geek(and computer fan in general) in the early days that it came out. It was his passion in life that he made into a successful career. So much so that while other fathers and sons were playing catch, he was showing me how to use Linux and Unix. I have many great memories of me and him bonding in front of a bash shell. I remember him telling everyone he saw(regardless of if they knew about linux or not) and acting like the proudest father alive when he taught me something as easy as how to cd into a directory when I was 6.\n I remember him religiously collecting stuffed penguins to add to his computer desk. There was a point where he had 10 scattered around and my mom complained that the work area was more penguin than desk. He was a goofy guy who managed to transfer his passions to me.\n Unfortunately, He got diagnosed with an early and aggressive form of dementia(frontotemporal) and ended up not being able to use computers anymore. He's been declining for years now and I've seen him go from the smartest person I've ever known to having the brain capacity of a newborn. He entered hospice two days ago and isn't expected to last much longer. Even through all of the deterioration, He still loves his stuffed penguin and has to have it near.\n I wanted to thank the community for always indulging him and sharing his same passion. This community was always the one that was the kindest to the goofy and eccentric guy who was my father. Truth be told, I can't even look at Linux right now without breaking down. I will in time though.\n    submitted by    /u/MyceliumJoe  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This week, we lost one of the great minds of our generation. Daniel dedicated the last 14 years of his life to creating an academic model for real-time threading. This work eventually led to the Linux Kernel runtime verification (RV), providing a practical use case for these models. He authored RTLA (Realtime Latency Analysis tool) that provides analysis of real-time performance and debugging based on models generated from RV. This marked a revolutionary approach to kernel debugging that relied on BPF and tracers to build live models of the current system state, as opposed to the historical method of black-box statically generated system states (i.e., kernel dumps and trace-cmd). \n While his work focused on real-time models, RV's reach expanded to general models of the stock Linux kernel (PREEMPT RT disabled) and successfully replaced tools like trace-cmd and, in some use cases, kdump. Today, I want to not only mourn the kernel legend that he had become but also the man himself. I had the honor of working with him, and the joy he brought into each and every room cannot be overstated. He blended a unique combination of compassion and genius that is rarely seen in the field of computer science, particularly at the level he reached. I will forever miss our casual fireside chats, our light-hearted debates about the best Prosecco drinks, and much, much more. RIP Daniel, you will be deeply missed by everyone in the community.\n    submitted by    /u/bootlesscrowfairy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We're all familiar with the use of 'dd' to write installers, the good old\n sudo dd if=installer.img of=/dev/sda2 bs=1M status=progress \n dance. It works, but it's not great:\n  \nThe progress info doesn't show progress as a percentage, nor does it calculate an ETA, it just shows bytes written.\n dd's default block size is a bad fit for most modern systems, hence the bs= parameter.\n It's easy to forget status=progress, and including it every time is a bit annoying.\n  \nNow, dd doesn't do anything special: it just reads from one file and writes to another. Tools like pv and cat could do the exact same thing. The only reason people really use dd for this purpose is that you can run dd as root, whereas redirecting the output of cat or pv requires running the shell itself as root. sudo dd ... is more terse than sudo sh -c 'cat ...'.\n A few weeks ago, I got annoyed with dd and implemented a --output option to the excellent tool called pv (\"Pipe Viewer\"). This meant that I could write images using sudo pv -o /dev/sda2 ... instead of using dd.\n Well, a week ago, PV released version 1.8.10 which contains my --output feature! Once your distribution updates to the latest version, you too can use pv instead of dd. Here are some advantages:\n  \npv shows an actual progress bar and an ETA, rather than just bytes written.\n pv automatically detects optimal buffer sizes.\n pv is more terse, since there is no need to specify status=progress or bs=....\n  \nTo ue pv instead of dd, simply run:\n sudo pv installer.img -Yo /path/to/block/device \n (The -Y is useful because it causes pv to sync after every write. This avoids the issue where the transfer hangs for a long time at 100% as buffers are flushed to the drive. -Yo is a nice mnemonic to remember :))\n Screenshot\n    submitted by    /u/mort96  \n [link]   [comments]",

If anyone is aware of such a program, I'd appreciate the recommendation.\n \nOLED care software for laptops: This isn't a dealbreaker, but it would be a nice quality-of-life feature to have software that can dim static elements or shift the screen image to prevent burn-in on OLED laptop displays (in my case a Asus Vivobook).\n \n Despite these concerns, I'm still excited about the prospect of using Linux as my primary operating system, and I hope the community continues to address these issues. If anyone has insights or solutions to the points I've raised, I'd love to hear them.\n Furthermore, I'd love to hear what aspects of Linux are lacking for your usecase.\n Wishing you all a wonderful day!\n    submitted by    /u/Execute_Gaming  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I installed Linux (specifically Arch + GNOME) about a week ago and I am very positively surprised!\n I always thought that Linux was for people who know what they are doing (🤓) and have a specific reason for doing it. Out of curiosity, I separated a small partition so that I could test whether I could even install it and use it for a few days, and a day later I decided to format my entire second drive (~500gb) on which I only had a few games and so far I have no reason to go back to Windows! Really, every application I wanted to go/install worked, there are so many guides and videos on YouTube explaining how to do various things.\n I can understand that some people may not like the fact that sometimes you have to type something into the console, but for me it's not a big deal to learn a dozen commands. I really see that this is a great community and the openness of the system is wonderful!\n I even told a friend to take a look at Linux, but he's not too interested, even after I showed him that it's a really cool system. However, I understand him, no one likes change if they feel comfortable.\n I really think that there is almost no effort (even Arch, which I installed , people said it might be quite difficult for a first Linux, but I really don't feel it)!\n I wanted to write my story and say Hello to the great community, I'm glad I found myself here!

          "description": "I've often seen how people talk about Alacritty's performance for example, given it is GPU-accelerated and written in Rust (hence compiled from a low-level language with very little overhead), but from my personal experience, I notice little to no difference from any other terminal emulators, at least not anything significant. I might want to add that my work environment and tools are mainly CLI-driven, and I mostly use CLI applications for everything (text editor, Git CLI, etc), including all the tools I use for my daily work.\n When choosing a terminal emulator, I focus mostly on usability and features. I personally use Wezterm because I find it incredibly malleable and easy to configure, while also providing very nice defaults. When I have used Alacritty in the past, I have found myself not liking it because it sacrifices a lot of things for the sake of performance, but I find myself unable to perceive the benefits of such performance improvements.\n I wanted to hear people's opinions mainly because I think I might be missing something, so please feel free to share your ideas and experiences.\n    submitted by    /u/ema2159  \n [link]   [comments]",

They started to prefer permissive licenses more as it suited some people's definition of software freedom. The GPL folks, on the other hand, made it an all or none issue, they wanted to license ALL software under GPL and the other side thought that idea was anti diversity.\n This is very much akin to the editor wars of the Boomer era (Vim vs Emacs) or the IDE wars of the millennial era (Visual Basic vs Borland Delphi, even Netbeans vs Eclipse).\n That's where we stand today and a huge majo…",

I'm discussing internaly the idea of creating a blog about it.\n For a quick recap, i'm a Network Engineer / Programmer that is leading a big Linux corporate migration at Policia Militar de Minas Gerais in Brazil. Our custom Ubuntu 22.04 distro is named \"Guara\" and were officially released yesterday. Guara has lots of custom and opensource software developed for the corporation needs, and aims to replace 22K PCs around the Minas Gerais state. In the first phase, we plan to replace 800 machines running an older Debian distros with mate desktop. This will be our first large scale test, as i write this post Guara is already running in 215 machines. In the second phase we plan to replace Windows 7 and 8 machines. To make the transition smoother we're also creating a series of small tik-tok tutorial videos, teaching basics for end users. Just for a quick note, here are our distro highilights:\n  \nUbuntu 22.04.4 based (24.04 already in the works)\n Onlyoffice 8.0\n Google Chrome\n Linphone as voip client\n Droidcam to use smartphones as webcams\n Some proprietary java applications\n Guara-updater \n Custom application developed for Guara.\n Automaticlally push custom configs at system boot\n \n Guara Installer \n Custom application created for Guara.\n Inventory the system and run initial scripts\n \n Argos Network Center \n Custom application created to test system components\n Test network conectivity\n Set http proxy for all the system (browser, cli and electron apps)\n Remote access with dynamic passwords (like teamviewer)\n \n  \nWe plan to open to project and release all the code as opensource, also create a reference documentation for a corporate linux migration with real world effort and dificulties along the way.\n Here is our special launch video, hope you like it.\n https://youtu.be/0uI0sIvVKAY\n    submitted by    /u/Sea-Load4845  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Not a big thing really, but i thought i'd share.\n Part of my job is running Updates on customer systems with ansible. The includes 2 things: \"Initiate\" the Update by selecting an environment to work with (this ensures you don't have to attach the -i flag to every ansible-playbook command) and then running 4-6 playbooks. Additionally, i do \"custom\" rollouts with any subset out of 30 or so playbooks, which are all contained in a folder.\n I was growing tired of having to type the path to customer inventorys and autofilling playbook names. This is tedious and with playooks often having similar names, i tended to have to type them out almost completely.\n So today, i spend a grand total of 20 minutes putting together two scripts that pipe either the environments or playbooks into fzf and the runs the needed command. So i now get interactive fuzzy search through our customers and playbooks. All of that without having to get a software approved by IT and all done in 10 lines of bash total.\n This then also made me realize i can just push my entire ssh config with some grep and filtering into fzf to get an interactive \"ssh launcher\".\n So really, 30 minutes spend wipping up 3 scripts that will now make my job easier and nicer every day. And that's possible because so many awesome tools are made to \"just work\" with each other through text input and output. That's why i love working on Linux every day.\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am kinda scared by how everything just works; Optimus works without me having to explicitly set anything up (or indeed even verify that it's working, since the Nvidia X Server Settings don't include Optimus settings), and this laptop sleeps better than it ever did on Windows, losing about 1% an hour while asleep and waking up just as fast. The sleep is something I was particularly worried about because this laptop does not support S3 at all, only supporting S0ix but apparently that's not a problem at all.\n    submitted by    /u/12pcMcNuggets  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just made it a bit smaller to have some space for Arch, but I ended up having a 30 GB ext4 partition that is absolutely unreadable. I just cannot mount the partition anymore, tried fixing it with fsck, but nothing worked. I don't want to remove the partition (yet) so I cloned the corrupt partition with dd. There was nothing really important on the partition, but I also have some savegames on there that I don't want to lose.

Here are the specs:\n Mobo: ASUS Prime H610M-K Processor: Intel Core i3 12100F Graphics: Nvidia Geforce GTX 1650 SUPER 12 Gigs of RAM\n Last time i spun Arch + KDE (X11) it has some weird issue where the screen would get choppy (even using proprietary nvidia driver)\n So, anyone have an experience on using KDE Plasma Wayland on Arch with NVIDIA GPU? and how does it perform against most games?

Because of that I wanted to see how it is myself. I decided to dualboot Arch with Windows 11, it all went smoothly. For the past few days I've been experimenting with a lot of stuff on Arch and I love how it all works. The terminal is great, customization is great, community is great, and I just appreciate the fact that something like Arch exists. However I still end up using Windows 11 for the regular stuff I do. Playing games, watching stuff, communication and many other due to how a most of the stuff is designed with just or mostly Windows in mind. However as always, there are workarounds and alternatives for a lot of these things. Not all unfortunately and that's why I think I'll always have to have a dualboot even if I end up liking Arch so much that it could be my single OS because of some of the things that you can't really do on it.\n I don't really have any things that require me to have Arch Linux or just a Linux in particular, I feel alright with what I can get using Windows, but I also somehow feel like I'd want to use Linux (Arch in particular) and get familiar with it. See how I can use it and whether I'll enjoy it or not. I'm neither a full Linux beginner or experienced. \n What do you think? Would it be a good idea to make Arch my main OS for a while and see how it goes? Try to transfer most of the stuff I do on Windows to Linux? Or should I just stay with Windows? Maybe find an old PC/Laptop and get Arch there? \n I'm really sorry if this seems like a \"stupid\" question. I really ended up liking Arch and Linux as a whole and would like to learn more, I see how it is better but I just don't know what I should do with this due to the fact that I'm really used to and feel dependent on Windows.\n Thank you for your time.\n    submitted by    /u/JxPV521  \n [link]   [comments]",

And a bit of the arch wiki.\n I managed to solve a few things but apparently I couldn't configure correctly the bootloader. So I gave up and watched the guy's well detailed video and skipped to the bootloader section. Now I have another working Arch install on my house (I have a laptop with arch) and my girlfriend, who was watching youtube videos all the time, was just begging for me to stop.\n All this because I just hate Windows.\n Tl;dr just the title and some problems with systemd's bootloader \n    submitted by    /u/LGhostWhat  \n [link]   [comments]",

Removing background noise from my mic based on a noise profile, it's so perfect, it works so perfectly! https://github.com/lucianodato/noise-repellent\n It is basically a replacement to reafir substract mode. It can get your noise profile, which should just be background noise, and remove it.\n I find this to be a lot more straightforward to do on Windows, for now, at least based on the way I do it currently. On Linux, Carla can look overwhelming, it was actually easier and faster to me but it does look much worse.\n Anyways, an amazing Linux win here. Only problem? Not a single tutorial tells you about this. Not a single source. I figured this out on my own, I mean google told me about noise repellent (prompt: linux reafir) but I figured out on my own that this confusing tutorial on reaplugs on linux I saw a thousand years ago used carla and I said \"maybe Carla helps\" without knowing a single thing about it, and I figured it out from there. Easyeffects also helped because their plugin showed up in Carla and I used it as guidance.\n Loving noise repellent. Wonderful work, and I guess it's smarter because it prefers to reduce noise instead of completely remove it (you can still remove it). I don't know if that's smarter.\n IMPORTANT: If you use Carla and maybe Ardour, your noise profile won't be saved. You need to build it yourself and merge pull request #119. Also, if you break easyeffects like I did, just reset the settings. Also, maybe keep a clean profile of carla saved in case you break something\n I hope there is an easier way to implement this, if not now in the future. Currently, I can't find it if I tell google \"linux remove background noise\", it only tells me of RNNoise and alternatives which work so badly in my case I rather not use it\n    submitted by    /u/patopansir  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am looking into getting a Snapdragon or Strix laptop depending on whether ARM is adopted by this holiday season. The Snapdragon could hopefully be the Year of Linux Desktop we’ve been waiting for. Mass adoption of enterprise software on Linux desktop would be huge. Hoping to get rid of windows for good as most of my terminal scripts are cross platform already and I have a 4090 PyTorch setup that I can play modded Skyrim/Fallout on proton whenever I get the itch.\n There is only one piece of software keeping me from ditching Windows 100%. \n FL Studio. \n As of right now, Linux Pro Audio is better than Windows because Jack/Pipewire is far better Pro Audio Driver than ASIO/CoreAudio have ever been. \n Wondering if any guru has gotten it working with real time latency. Wine causes XRUNS when running the WineAsio driver and buffer sizes and latency must increase to accommodate. The Wine NSPA Kernel that is meant to fix real time audio gives me better performance but xruns pop up at ~15ms or under. \n If not, can any recommend a KVM solution that would let me run it on Mac/Windows VM that can route with Jack/Pipewire? Would obv pass through audio card. But if there is a config out there that would allow me to run the FL without needing to restart every time, I’d love to hear it. I would even buy another audio interface just for routing from the pass through audio via cable to my Linux audio card. \n I know the answer is likely no but I can’t be the only moron that has been trying to make this work for years.

This weekend I will wipe my Windows installation and make a \"final\" installation (although let's be real, it will never really be final...).\n I notice I'm making a lot of tweaks to various files in /etc,... like configure Pacman mirrors, networking, tweak sound setup, mess with fstab, and much more.\n The problem is, I have failed to keep track of these changes. So when I will install my \"final\" setup, I will no doubt forget a lot of the tweaks I've made. It's not a big deal, I can just apply them again later, but still it's nice to remember and review these changes. Also maybe later in the future, if I want to install Arch elsewhere, or reinstall my system, it would be nice to see how my /etc will have deviated from the defaults...\n I have found etckeeper, which is nice and I'll probably check it out, but seems more about keeping a complete log of all changes to /etc, which is not entirely what I'm personally interested in. If I update some packages, and they replace some defaults with new defaults I probably won't care about it that much (unless everything breaks of course). But I am really interested in e.g. if manually made some tweaks to the NTP config which I want to replicate on my future laptop install.\n How do you manage this?

It's been a pretty smooth experience so far, especially after the 555 drivers for nVidia were released. Wayland has been usable and very enjoyable.\n KDE Plasma 6\n SDDM\n nVidia Proprietary Drivers (555 beta drivers)\n I jumped on my desktop before leaving for work this morning and noticed in the system tray there were updates available. Opened up Discovery and installed the available updates. I quickly skimmed through the list and saw a few Mesa packages, and a bunch of KDE apps updating from 6.2 to 6.3.\n Installed the updates, everything completed. I rebooted my PC and it appeared to be booting up just fine. When the screen switched to what I would assume would have been the login screen it just went black instead. After a few seconds the UEFI logo for my motherboard was displayed on the screen again and nothing happens after this.\n I used CTRL+ALT+F3 to access the shell, rechecked pacman for updates, but didn't find any. System is fully updated. I tried another reboot, same result.\n I honestly didn't have a lot of time to poke around and troubleshoot as I had to run to work. I'll be heading home soon.

          "description": "Has anyone been using f2fs as their main disks' file system? How does it compare to EXT4? \n Here is what I've come to understand in my research:\n  \nf2fs is designed with the physical structure of NAND flashes in mind. So it's \"optimized\" for SSDs (whether SATA or NVMe), SD cards and thumb drives.\n \nf2fs performs procedures like TRIM and GC more smartly than generic file systems like ext4. It also supports modern features like transparent compression and encryptin.\n \nf2fs is faster than the more popular alternatives.\n \nacording to sporadic forum posts from a few years ago, f2fs is less stable than ext4. There are reports of corruption and issues like noticable delays on boot when it is used. \n \nAFAIK, debian bookworm installer does not support it in install wizard. You have to partition manually. Also, some versions of GRUB don't support booting from f2fs. Don't know whether it's the case for the GRUB that came with Debian 12...\n \n Since f2fs was introduced in 2012, instability issues could be expected but I wonder whether these issues have been fixed in like Debian Bookworm?

I want to also have a backup saved to my Microsoft OneDrive account (ie so I have a cloud backup).\n The NAS is linked as a remote SMB location on Dolphin. I then have mounted a folder from the NAS as a local folder so AgentDVR can save directly to it. At the moment this is working without issue (ie video is successfully being saved from AgentDVR to my NAS).\n I have installed onedriver and mounted my OneDrive folder locally as well. The OneDrive folder is syncing with the cloud in both directions without issue.\n I am stuck at the next step which is trying to have the local mounted NAS folder sync with the mounted OneDrive folder. I want this to be an automated/ongoing process where ideally there is a check for a difference between the folders and if there is the backup is triggered.\n I have tried searching for solutions but I feel like the fact these folders I am trying to sync are remote folders mounted as local ones is causing some issues.

I was looking for a much more lightweight and more private alternative to Windows and Debian Linux came up a lot. After reading up on it and seeing how everyone says its on of the most stable distros out there I thought this might be perfect for my usecase.\n My usecase:\n I'm a digital artist, I use graphics tablet via HDMI and USB ports and I dabble in game-dev with Godot game engine. I don't play any games I have a Xbox for that, but I do like to watch Stuff on YouTube a lot as well as Netflix/Disney+. I use a laptop but its a desktop replacement machine so I don't care about Battery life. It has a 1060 6GB GPU. Currently looking for good alternative programs to Krita.\n So my questions are:\n  \nIf you use private browsing in a browser like Chrome or Firefox, is it really private? Like is it possible for any contents to spill over to disk or get cached to disk and is there a easy way to prevent that?\n Will I need a anti-virus for Linux and if so which one is the best one to get that is low impact on my system?\n Can everything or most thing be accomplished by using the GUI/desktop\n Can I have multiple drives on Linux, like on my windows system I have a C drive and then another SSD which is my D drive.\n Is Debian stable? Like are there any forced updates or crashes that can happen?\n Is there a way to delete all traces of USB drive history? \n Is there any keylogging or stuff like that on Debian?\n  \nThat's all the things I can think of at the moment.\n    submitted by    /u/GentleDomFanatic  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For a while now, I've been trying to find more up-to-date alternatives based on Debian, so far I've found three of them interesting:\n Kali As it contains a multitude of software focused on cybersecurity, many associate it with activities focused on the same field, this is true, but another truth is the repository is full of useful for a common user and updated software.For gnome lovers, this seems to be the only one, besides Ubuntu, that has a more up-to-date gnome, apart from the fact that Nautilus is outdated for reasons I don't know. Until then, it seems like a better alternative. 1. Imports Debian packages, that is, it has its own repository; 2. It is officially Rolling Release, unlike Debian Testing; and 3. Is maintained by the community;\n Siduction To be honest, I can't say much about this one, but it looks like it's a Rolling Release that uses unstable repositories. It is not so autonomous from Debian that one can even question the reason why use it instead of unstable itself?\n Ubuntu There's not much that can be said, it's an excellent choice. Many who don't recommend Ubuntu do so because of snap, but the truth is Ubuntu is still a great choice even or especially without snap. It's not that it's about hating snaps or not, but if canonical allowed the community to keep .deb versions of the snaps they took down, that would be the best. But users can stay out of these snaps, for example, for FF using the Mozilla PPA, and I'm not a fan of having multiple software sources on the system, it's an easy opening for problems.\n Do you know of another with the following characteristics?: 1. It's a community project; 2. Focuses exclusively on the .deb format; 3. Instead of using direct Debian repositories, import from salsa into it's own repositories; 4. It is released every 6 months or a year, or even is a Rolling Release.\n Tell me in the comments \n    submitted by    /u/ExaHamza  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm curious to hear from people with experience on authoring Debian packages: what steps do you need to take to go from having no experience at all in contributing a package to having it present in future stable versions of Debian?\n Some of you might recognise me as the original author of ALE, and a very small number might know I'm the President & Treasurer of the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organisation that holds the copyright for ALE and other projects, Dense Analysis. I love working on FOSS and will do in some capacity until my last breath.\n I really, really love xmms2 and I've been a regular user of it since around 2010. I was really sad last year when xmms2 just stopped working completely in KDE Neon, and then really happy recently when an update to the packages fixed everything. What's even better is that I wrote what I believe is a very good implementation of MPRIS integration for xmms2, which upon completing a recent update actually continued to fuction stably with zero changes to my code. I previously made a package available via an Ubuntu PPA I still use myself. (Eat your own dogfood.)\n Repeating my initial question, what should I reasonably do to move this package into Debian stable itself in future? I think mailing lists are a very 1990's thing and have always been strange to me, and I'm from 1989 myself. I am very comfortable with IRC, though it's been a while.

          "description": "Hi! Since Debian 12 came out I started to get an issue with delayed mouse input I made post about it there:\n https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/14m9gxq/mouse_input_lag/\n Today I accidentally found a fix and possibly bug in Gnome. I started game through terminal as usual and there was mouse delay. Then I rebooted machine and locked screen since I had to left for few minutes when I came back I unlocked screen, I run the game thorugh terminal again and I was surprised my mouse worked flawlessly. I rebooted machine run the game again and there was delay again. I started to think what I did differently and came to conclusion that I locked screen. So I tried again I rebooted, locked screen wait some seconds unlocked screen run the game and there was no delay again. Not sure why that happens but perhaps something is funky with compositor when locking/unlocking screen?\n tl;dr Locking and unlocking screen with meta+L shortcut fixes the issue for some reason.\n    submitted by    /u/andreas213  \n [link]   [comments]",

A BTRFS file system with a snapshot utility and grub-btrfs seems to be the closest to the nixos implementation from what I read. However that seems to require compiling grub-btrfs from source.\n I have never compiled a tool for my system before. As I understand I would need to try and manually keep up with update the package. Worry about dependencies due to debian having slightly older versions. And making sure to remove them on system upgrade.\n As I want the system rollback because I am trying to learn more about my system while acknowledging I could screw everything up, this seems like a bad idea.\n So I am curious what would the easiest/safest option be? Simply hope that I don't mess anything up too badly so I can get at least get past grub to use a basic timeshift reversion?\n I apologize for being ignorant. Reading into btrfs backups and ext4 rsync backups has gone a bit over my head and I don't want to blindly follow tutorials.

However, I am running into issues after install. I have tried two different types of install (1) graphical install with KDE Plasma installation & other prerequisites as part of standard install and (2) graphical install BUT unticking everything except for \"standard system utilities\". The issue is whether I choose to install KDE Plasma Task via graphical install or install KDE standard via command line, I can't boot into the default kernel running 6.1.0-21-amd64 and gives me a out of memory error. But if I choose Advance Options in grub menu and choose kernel running 6.1.0-18-amd64, I can boot into Debian with no issues. Question - how do I make sure grub menu always selects the 6.1.0-18 kernal and I don't keep having to go Advance Options and manually select it.
