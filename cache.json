I've been programming for 12 years or so, some c++ and java but mostly js and python. \n I feel like I have a good grasp of the basic language, but there's a gap between me and someone who writes systems software professionally. I have a long term goal of contributing to CPython, as well as understanding the machine on a deeper level.\n So i'd like to know, what could take me from just knowing the syntax to being a 'C programmer'? In particular:\n Any good places to learn the history and best practices of the language? Is there a bible for c, or good places for news?\n where does one find c programmers online? Where are the water holes?\n As someone interested in really the whole machine (not just python interp), any good next steps?

I've seen many tutorials on the internet but they all have different methods of going about it and, till now, I haven’t found any tutorial that explains how to properly structure a library and use it with Cmake\n There are many terms in cmake that I fail to understand (such as target, static, public etc) and I don’t even think I understand the use of cmake. I thought a build system was used to compile our code in a simpler, more organized way but what I’m reading is that Cmake is a build system that builds build systems?

          "description": "A bit of a debugging story... I was writing a JIT compiler (long story); after a restructuring of the codebase and ironing out the initial bugs, I hit a really peculiar problem. It worked alright under gcc but strangely Clang failed with a segfault. The instruction in question was an access to a pointer 8 bytes before the JITted function before calling it, which was odd, because I was only calling the function and not doing anything else. It was a compare with this constant 0xc105cafe which looked out of place and seemed very much like hexspeak. Looking it up on a search engine lead me straight to a source file in clang's source code. Turns out that if UBSan is enabled, then Clang (undocumentedly) requires that the two words before the entry of every function be accessible. They claim that a function where the previous two bytes are not accessible is \"not reasonable for application or library code\", and the maintainers don't want to fix it for (annoyingly legitimate AFAICT) performance reasons. (Sorry for my horrendous English, by the way)\n TL;DR: When using UBSan, Clang uses a workaround that requires the two words before all functions being accessible, a function where is considered \"unreasonable\". My JIT (like most others I would think) uses mmap to get pages for writing bytecode to (so they can be made executable later) and when compiled under UBSan/Clang, calling the JITted function segfaults because of said hack.\n    submitted by    /u/carpintero_de_c  \n [link]   [comments]",

The library was inspired by this rust based deferred formatting library defmt.\n Hope it's okay to post here as this library has two halves, one in C and another in Rust.\n On the C side the library is a header-only library, that requires some modifications to the linker script, and only requires gnu c99 (or maybe even 89) (which is supported by most compilers).\n The C related part sits in cdefmt/include/cdefmt.h\n All of the log strings are being embedded into the resulting `.elf` file. which can be later stripped before being flashed to the device or running on the host.\n The resulting logs are very small, only the size of a pointer per log + whatever arguments were sent to the log.\n Once the device generates the logs, they can be parsed using a library I wrote in rust.\n Given the logs' binary stream and the original elf, the logs can be reconstructed and the parameter's types are inferred from the debugging information encoded in the elf.\n There's support for format hints, enum name lookup and more.\n Currently the code reached a minimum viable product status, there's quite a bit of cleanup and documentation to be done and some missing features to implement, however I thought now would be a good time to share the library and get some feedback.\n An example is provided and validated on a linux system.\n Small example of a log:\n typedef struct some_struct { uint64_t a; uint32_t b; uint16_t c; } some_struct_t; struct some_struct some_struct = { .a = 1234567890123456789, .b = 1234567890, .c = 12345, }; CDEFMT_INFO(\"some struct: {}\", some_struct); \n And the parsed log:\n Info > some struct: {a: 1234567890123456789, b: 1234567890, c: 12345} \n TL;DR: I made a logging library that I think is pretty cool.\n Link: https://github.com/RisinT96/cdefmt\n    submitted by    /u/RisinT96  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand C fairly well, but it's not my main language and C itself is not tied with my day-to-day responsibilities and tasks at work. I'm trying to collect insights and compose a learning plan to help them dive in and understand basics and more. To sum it up - I guess I need a pretty detailed roadmap. Also, I think it's important to provide a fair bit of practice. And I personally want this practice be as much interesting, interactive and maybe even fun to do. I know that there are resources as easy-level LeetCode and such, but to my personal preference - it's too early for them to try them out. Maybe you can convince me otherwise.\n I've learned that Reddit can be a great resource for such a deal, so here I am, writing this post.\n I'm truly eager to hear you all out and take part in the conversation.

My question now is how should I progress and deep my knowledge that it will be possible to do some projects and something relevant, as I find myself always stuck on the basic level of every language and don't to further with developing projects\n My first idea is to practice data structures and algorithms using C and then maybe LeetCode a bit using C. But I want to work with AI later in my career so I searched a bit and apparently I can use C for Image Processing. Another idea, is to do Computer Graphics using OpenGL.\n So, what are you suggestion and what I can do in order to build some projects for a portfolio\n    submitted by    /u/DiegoGomesDG  \n [link]   [comments]",

I build this package in Manjaro with gcc 14.1.1 and it picked up 2 errors - long/int mismatch. Then tried Endeavor OS, same gcc 14.1.1 compiler. Both are spinoffs of Archlinux, so presumed compilers would be indentical. It found a lot more long/int mismatch errors, returns without a value, and functions without prototypes and the obsolete 'caddr_t' type. Both compilers seem to be defaulting to std=c17. Same source files and makefiles. So is there some secret environment variable or config file that is telling compiler to go full nitpicking mode?

          "description": "I've been googling like a maniac and am still confused about how the C standard library is provided and used on different systems and compilers.\n Why is the C standard library shipped with the OS, and not with the compiler? For example, glibc on Linux and ucrt on Windows? And how does the compiler enter the picture here? Like does it care about the standard library (and/or the OS API)? Or does it just generate binary for whatever source code is given to it without caring about anything else (except the target platform for which it is designed of course)?\n Also, according to the knowledge I've gathered, it should be totally possible for you to not use the standard library at all (I mean there is literally a nostdlib option in GCC), right? After all it is just a library in the end. There's also the prospect of the runtime library, which I think is just startup and exit routine (crt0.o. Please correct me if I am wrong). Can we also replace this library with our own? I think that should be possible because we just need OS API calls (like the functions in windows.h).\n    submitted by    /u/KRYT79  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been reading some codebases, but haven't been able to decide what is the best way to do the following: I have a function that parses command line arguments:\n struct args { ... bunch of arguments struct some_other_struct* ptrmember; } struct args args_parse(int argc, const char **argv); \n This initial version returns struct args by value. I'm not entirely sure if it is the way to go, since it is a somewhat large struct (5 members), more importantly, the ptrmember member inside needs to be free'd, and it feels like returning a struct by value implies that there is no cleanup needed. I'm also not sure if I should make the caller responsible for free'ing free(args.ptrmember) or have a args_free function which does it.\n Some alternatives that may be better:\n int args_parse(int argc, const char **argv, struct args* out); \n  \nAdded benefit of having return value.\n Allows caller to decide whether to allocate args on heap or put it on stack.\n Still it is not entirely clear as to whether the caller is responsible for free'ing ptrmember I feel like (since it is allocated by args_parse, but the caller initialized the containing struct).\n  \nOr may be the C way is to not use a struct at all and just have a bunch of out parameters like so:\n int args_parse(int argc, const char **argv, enum action* out_action, struct some_other_struct* out_ptrmember); \n  \nThis one makes it very clear that the caller is responsible for freeing out_ptrmember IMO, but I'm not sure if it is best practice to use out variables so liberally here.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/aangebrandpannenkoek  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I saw this comment on YouTube regarding the performance cost of virtual methods in object-oriented languages, and designing extensible APIs in C:\n  \nFunction pointers in a vtable structure. Which makes the call complicated for the compiler to optimize and then continues to make the processors job harder, by making it more likely to mis-predict the function call and thus waste cycles restarting the pipeline. Restarting the pipeline can take 5 to 15 cycles. A modern processor executes about 2 instructions per cycle. If you need to interface two pieces of code together that are not developed at the same time by the same people, use a header file. Let the compiler and linker collapse the abstraction away, so the processor isn't bothered by extra work and an unpredictable workload.\n  \nMy question is what does this look like in practice? What is a simple example showing how one header file can extend the functionality of another header file similar to virtual methods in a language like Java? And is this technique more than just function pointers?\n    submitted by    /u/El_Redditor_xdd  \n [link]   [comments]",

The problem is, I can't understand how it works and I spent the whole day trying. The exercise asked to write a program in C that finds flawless' squares. That is, numbers whose digits (all digits MUST be used), when summed and squared, give the number itself. For example, 81 is flawless square since (8+1)^2 = 81 and 1296 since (1+29+6)^2 = (36)^2 = 1296. The tricky part is that it's digits can combine but not freely (for example 196 + 2 is not an acceptable combination of \"1296\" digits).

It's a Multiplayer Flappy bird game (just rectangles) written purely in C using Raylib and LibUV. The client sends inputs to the server which sends back gamestates at a fixed interval. The gamestates are rendered with a 100ms render delay to allow packets from the server to arrive (keeping gameplay consistently smooth). It does not have any client side prediction but it is a very simple design for getting into multiplayer game development. The core of the code is contained in two files (server.c and client.c). Gameloop has collision detection, response, very basic physics, map collision loading and rendering.\n If you'd like to test it by yourself , change kMaxNumberOfPlayers in gameshared.h to 1 and launch server then client.\n https://github.com/lolirelia/Flappy.git\n    submitted by    /u/oneuglycat  \n [link]   [comments]",

Practically I've always achieved this by always having some kind of \"init\" function in all but my highest level modules that accepts function pointers. This allows the higher level modules that are dependent on this module to \"inject\" pointers to \"callback\" functions.\n I found myself questioning if passing these functions pointers at runtime, given that I don't ever expect them to change, is really the optimal solution here. Alternative ways to achieve this that I can think of are forward declaring the function I need, or just having circular dependencies. These both seems to significantly complicate life for the linker and feel I like that's bad practice.\n Actually, I guess I don't really understand why you would ever forward declare a function vs just giving the external function a header and including that, maybe that's part of the issue here?\n Maybe I'm architecting this fundamentally wrong, or maybe I'm just over thinking things, I'd love any feedback.\n Edit: I probably should have a given a code example from the beginning:\n main.c\n include \"timer.h\" void timerCallback(void){ doThings(); } int main(void){ initTimer(timerCallback); startTimer(); } \n timer.h\n void initTimer(void(*callback)(void)); void startTimer(void); \n timer.c\n include \"timer.h\" static void(*execCallback)(void); void initTimer(void(*callback)(void)){ execCallback = callback; } void startTimer(void){ wait(1000); execCallback(); } \n Its kind of a dumb example it gets the point across, I'm basically asking what the optimal way is to call the timerCallback func defined in main from timer.c\n    submitted by    /u/MikeExMachina  \n [link]   [comments]",

Should I use assertions? macros? my build system? \n I have no solid foundations on the subject of software testing, so I'm a bit lost.. I just want to have a system that is simple and I can use for a while until I am more experienced.\n Right now, I mostly write basic utilities, usually leveraging Linux syscalls (these can fail sometimes, so I believe I need to test that too, not sure tho). \n Anyways..

I am trying to understand how constness works for double pointers, and so far, my answer is \"it doesn't\".\n From what I've read, the way the const qualifier works for a pointer is that if the const qualifier is before the *, then the constness applies to the thing being pointed at, while if the const qualifier is after the * then it applies to the pointer itself. Therefore a const int * is a pointer that you can have point to multiple things without issue, but cannot change the value being pointed at. For double pointers, the logic I have says that const int ** dp is a double pointer where you can edit dp, dp[0], but not dp[0][0]. and const int *const * dp means I can change dp, but neither dp[0], nor dp[0][0].

The vol 2 you don't normally read, but rather just skim it if you have time.\n \nI’ve only read Unix Network Programming Volume 1. But Unix Network Programming pairs very well with Volume 2 of the illustrated series.\n \nVolumes 2 and 3 are more about the actual code used to implement the protocols, so unless you're going to be writing such code (or are just curious), you can probably safely skip those.\n \n The preface to UNIX Network Programming itself claims that TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 2) is a good complimentary read:\n  \nTCPv2 contains a high level of detail very closely related to the material in this book, as it describes and presents the actual 4.4BSD implementation of the network programming functions for the sockets API (socket, bind, connect, and so on). If one understands the implementation of a feature, the use of that feature in an application makes more sense.\n  \nSo is it fair to assume that I should read TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 1), then TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 2), and finally UNIX Network Programming, or is that overkill? From what I could glean, the general opinion is that TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 1) and UNIX Network Programming seem to be enough.

          "description": "RSGL is a versatile cross-platform graphics library designed for simplicity and convenience. It offers features like shape drawing, text rendering, and customizable widgets. With no external dependencies and a modular structure, it provides flexibility for various projects. \n Although RSGL is a graphics library, it only handles graphics data. rendering must be done externally of RSGL.h. By default, RSGL includes RSGL_gl.h which is a opengl backend for RSGL. \n RSGL also includes a small window abstraction over RGFW but you can use any windowing library with RSGL. RSGL includes an example for using RSGL with GLFW.\n Other than being very dynamic and modular in use, RSGL is also designed to be very lightweight, the current release, this includes compiled binaries, is only ~500kb and the header itself is only 120kb. \n Here is a simple example of how to use RSGL\n #define RSGL_IMPLEMENTATION #include \"RSGL.h\" int main(void) { // create a window at the center of the screen RSGL_window* win = RSGL_createWindow(\"name\", (RSGL_rect){500, 500, 500, 500}, RSGL_CENTER); // create a toggle rounded button in light mode RSGL_button toggle = RSGL_initButton(); RSGL_button_setPolygon(&toggle, RSGL_RECT(50, 125, 100, 50), 36); RSGL_button_setStyle(&toggle, RSGL_STYLE_LIGHT | RSGL_STYLE_TOGGLE | RSGL_STYLE_ROUNDED); // while the should should stay open while (RGFW_window_shouldClose(win) == false) { // loop through each event to avoid lag while (RSGL_window_checkEvent(win)) { // check button info RSGL_button_update(&toggle, win->event); } // draw a rectangle RSGL_drawRect(RSGL_RECT(200, 200, 200, 200), RSGL_RGB(255, 0, 0)); // draw the button RSGL_drawButton(toggle); // clear the screen (and render) RSGL_window_clear(win, RSGL_RGB(100, 100, 100)); } // close the window and free everything RSGL_window_close(win); } \n    submitted by    /u/Comrade-Riley  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can't even run a simple Hello world program. It keeps telling me kindly specify the correct input path. I've tried lots of solutions, went to their documentation web page, asked Copilot, went through the intellisense configuration but I'm still stuck 😭\n Isn't it the <stdio.h> to be able to call the printf() function?

My first idea of how this might be implemented is something like this:\n static_assert(_proven_impossible(i == 10));\n In the above example the following would hypothetically cause a compiler error, because the programmer’s assumption about their code could be proven incorrect at compile time:\n static_assert(_proven_possible(i == 15));\n But maybe it’s possible to get a printout of possible and impossible ranges (as far as the compiler knows) for specific variables at specific points in the program:\n _known_possible_ranges(i);\n Also maybe there are tools that can do this?\n Edit:\n Several People seem to have misunderstandings about my question, this may be my fault, so I want to make this clear:\n My question is NOT about TELLING the compiler what is possible, I know about things like _builtin_assume, _builtin_unreachable my question is if there is a way to EXTRACT INFORMATION which states the compiler could prove that my program can or can never reach, some kind of assert macro that works on non constant expressions but is still evaluated at compile time.

Some are reasonable to use only after some other ones have been tried. Some can be used inside or outside other strategies.\n These strategies are more or less useful depending on the type of network that is given. Hence, I would like to give the user as much freedom as possible in mixing and matching these strategies, but I am not sure how to best structure that in the code.\n An example: say the strategies are A, B, C, D. Then I would like to user to be able to select:\n  \nA only\n A then C then B\n B then A then C\n A with C enabled inside, then D, then C again.\n A with C disabled inside, then C.\n  \netc. Another complication is that some of these strategies (like A and D) require some data structures to be maintained, while others (like B and C) don't. So if A and D are done consecutive then I don't want to re-build the data structures, but if A and D are not consecutive, then I do want to re-build them.\n Is there any general advice you can give for this situation, or a code base or book I can look at for inspiration?\n Thank you very much.\n    submitted by    /u/LearningStudent221  \n [link]   [comments]",

And I would be very interested in hearing your feedback on the code overall. \n Just to be clear, this is technically not like the real printf because it doesn't use file streams, so maybe consider it more like a dprintf to stdout. I have no idea how file streams work but I don't think it would be very hard to change that if I wanted to. \n Liberal inspiration was taken from from this post, all the heavy lifting was done there, I just added the va_arg parsing and the logic for the flags. \n Any feedback would help because I have no idea if I have taken bad approaches on this project or if the code is even readable.\n My main concern is the testing approach I have taken, I think it is pretty bad, it was tedious to wrote and is very error prone, so there might be bugs in my code I'm not even aware of.\n  \nNote: the coding convention is not my own, it is my school's, so the code will probably look very weird to most of you, I personally don't like it but that's just how it is.. \n Try not to take stylistic choices too much into consideration if you review my code but absolutely feel free to point out odd things or stuff you would not recommend doing in general. \n Here is a very brief (not exhaustive) summary of the coding guidelines I had to work with: \n  \n4 spaced tabs for indentation\n 25 lines per function max\n 80 columns max\n 5 functions per .c file max\n 4 named parameters per function max\n C89 style variable declarations\n for loops, switch case, goto are forbidden\n  \nIf you want a good laugh I can also send you the entire pdf lol.\n    submitted by    /u/ismbks  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now I did not do a full ub test on the mpi build but at first glance it seems to work.\n I tested it on the busy beaver game. Ofc I am not going to get anywhere near anything interesting there but I thought its a cool problem and I wana throw my hat in the ring. \n The basic premise was that evaluation of a specific Turing machine can block the entire pool. So I split it into many pools and they each send their best candidates to a manager that would decide if its worth broadcasting. \n With just 4 processes I got results which were WAY better than the single threaded version.

The key challenges might be:\n • How to obtain real-world map data\n • How to modify, expand, and customize the map data\n An ASCII renderer like MapSCII can achieve great effects, but it might be overkill for my project.

Now, instead of all threads having to finish all of their work, I want to stop the others when one of them finds a solution and returns.\n So previously I didn't need any synchronisation, I could simply join all threads in any order in main because I would have to wait for all of them to finish anyway. But now I want to signal/message/abort/kill all the other threads when one of them returns. Because the threads are completely independent, I don't think I need any condition variables, mutexes or message queues. What I did is: have one global atomic bool running = true and set it to false in one thread when a solution is found. The other threads check for this condition in their inner loop (so, often) and return when it's false.\n This works, but is it the best solution? Polling the global bool so often seems wasteful, but is signalling/messaging a better option? And I'm not quite sure where to start.

Alot of malware killers are infecting the device, then there method of “killing” is killing any process that is statically compiled (always malware) the method used is looking in the processes maps file for strings such as “.so” & “/lib/“ to detect if a process is static, if its compiled statically they kill the process.\n My question is; why are malware owners doing this to kill other running malware?

It's like buying a whole pizza and then throwing away 7 out of 8 slices just because you're \"not that hungry.\"\n And don't even get me started on the sheer inefficiency. In a world where every nanosecond and bit of memory counts, C is just out here throwing bytes around like they grow on trees. You might as well be programming on an abacus for all the efficiency you're getting. Think about all the extra memory you're using – it's like driving a Hummer to deliver a single envelope.\n It's 2024, people! We have the technology to optimize every single bit of our programs, but C is stuck in the past, clinging to its archaic ways. I mean, what's next? Are we going to use 8-track tapes for data storage again? Get with the program, C!\n Honestly, the fact that C still gets used is a mystery. I can't even look at a C codebase without cringing at the sheer wastefulness. If you care even a tiny bit about efficiency, readability, or just basic common sense, you'd run far, far away from C and its byte-wasting bools.

          "description": "Very memory conscious applications may consider cramming data into (usually the highest bits of) pointers. Most 64 bit systems support 48 bit virtual addresses, leaving room for a 2 bytes of data. This obviously comes at the cost of portability.\n However, if the program is aware at compile time of its maximum memory requirement (and assumes some fragmentation overhead), it should be able to restrict its virtual address space via setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS, &rlim) , ensuring a program defined number of bits in pointers are usable.\n For example, say I know my program will never use more than 6 GiB. Then its VA space could be confined to 8 GiB (33 bit addresses). This ensures I get 31 bits for data in my pointers:\n unsigned long long MAX_ADDR = (1ull<<34) - 1; const struct rlimit { rlim_t rlim_cur; rlim_t rlim_max; } r = { MAX_ADDR, MAX_ADDR}; setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS, &r); \n One specific application (that prompted the idea) are bitmap tries, where the alphabet size imposes whether the bitmap of a node can be stored within the pointer or has to be a separate field (also taking up memory due to alignment).\n Thoughts? Is this a decent idea for making tagged pointers portable or squeezing more memory?\n    submitted by    /u/_radu_b  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi. I've been coding a terminal text editor in C purely for the learning experience of low level programming. However, I've run into a problem that I can't really wrap my head around. If I try moving the cursor to the end of a line with tabs, the cursor will stop too early. Therefore, I thought maybe I should replace the tab characters for each line of the file, but then I remembered Vim. Vim can change the 'shiftwidth' of the tab character (i.e 8 spaces get turned into 2 spaces according to the shiftwidth variable) without directly affecting the line itself! So I'm wondering how I can implement this in my own program and allow the cursor to adjust to the tab size?\n For reference, here's the source code for my program if anyone's interested: https://github.com/MoolsDogTwo/Centi\n Buffer & cursor functions are in their respective c & h files. This program is by no means functional yet, but it's better something than nothing.\n    submitted by    /u/MoolsDogTwo_reddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Capturing this satisfies the linker for gcc but makes no difference for clang. Adding inline (regardless of capture) fixes things for both.\n I read previously that omitting inline on a member function declared within the class definition in a module interface has somewhat similar behaviour as if the function implementation were in a cpp file. However in the case of deduced return type, splitting declaration and definition in that way wouldn't be allowed; regardless I'm unsure how that relates to these errors, and it's not clear to me that there should be anything wrong with omitting inline in this case.\n Compiler Explorer link: https://godbolt.org/z/Knfjf3aMe\n    submitted by    /u/kamrann_    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I can demonstrate that I am very proficient in low latency C++ without having worked in the finance domain, do I have a chance to get hired?\n Does a middle aged applicant have any disadvantages when applying or is it viewed an asset to be more experienced.\n Are C++ engineers in the HFT world just backoffice resources who are kept in the dark and code or is there any customer interaction or business trips to meet with clients and other colleges?\n Finally, I know there is a lot of online C++ training and lots of books that touch on the subject. I usually learn much better if those elements are taught in a project specific way . I am hoping there is an excellent course out there that lets you build an actual low latency trading platform from ground up , teaching you a fundamental concept at each step. The only resource I have found is this book:Building low latency applications with C++.

About a year or so ago, my work started having me work in C++ (id say maybe 18 months now?).\n While I am doing it, I have 0 actual knowledge of C++, or well, lets be generous and say 0.5 because I did learn some stuff along the way. It is a strange position to be in, as I can be coding quite complicated C++ code (or rather quite complicated program features, in code I am sure is nowhere near as effective as it could be).\n All while not really understanding why I am doing what I am doing.\n Which means I also find tutorials at beginner's level incredibly boring (and not being worth my time) while advanced stuff just, well, loses me pretty fast. Maybe good to know I do not come from an engineering/CS background. I did a 2y education that was very hands-on, and have very little knowledge of the hardware side of programming for example.\n I have 3 small children and a full time job, so time is limited. Id say maybe 5h a week is the max I can commit to this.\n Ideal would of course be to be mentored through work, but this has been discussed numerous times, with a promise of the odd hour per week 1-on-1 with one of the very seniors developpers, but they are so busy it has literally never happened.\n Im thinking pointers? Vectors? Is there for example Udemy classes that focus on such \"small\" concepts?

          "description": "I'm implementing something that should accept multiple types, so long as they satisfy/implement a specific interface that I'm requiring.\n I'm debating whether to use runtime polymorphism (i.e. virtual functions), or make my API a template with C++20 concepts.\n Main considerations to take into account:\n  \nRuntime polymorphism is not ACTUALLY needed in this case. I know at compile-time the concrete type that I want to use when using this API. So virtual functions are on the table just for the mechanism of enforcing an implementation of a specific API\n Runtime cost is not so important here. The cost of pointer indirection with virtual functions is negligble here. So I can afford using virtual functions even though I don't really require the runtime aspect of it.\n  \nIMO the main reason to use virtual functions over templates - template implementations generally have to be placed in the header file, which is not ideal.\n IMO the main reason to use templates over virtual functions - I'm a strong believer of using the \"weakest\" tool needed for the job. This makes the intention of your code clear and concise.\n The runtime aspect provided by virtual functions seems like an overkill, and in terms of readability, future readers will have to read the code and scratch their heads just to figure out if runtime polymorphism was needed here or not.\n In general, it feels like template+concepts is the way that C++ seems to want me to do stuff (correct me if you think this is wrong) when all I need is compile-time polymorphism.\n Non of the reasons mentioned above convince me in any direction.\n Which would you choose in this case, virtual functions, or templates+concepts?

Which game subsystems should be singletons?

The .cpp file is not much interesting as it just mostly follows the paper's implementation. But the linux perf tool showed benchmarks/perf1.cpp spends the most time on these two functions which is accepted but I am not sure if it's there spending some unexpected amount of time just syscalling: FixedPool::ForcedAllocate and FixedPool::ForcedDeAllocate\n The main issue is my implementation seems to spend too much time on syscalls. And tbf I really don't have any idea about the total memory model of my implementation.\n Any kind of suggestions would be helpful well it's code-review, I am ready to face criticism. Syntax, design-decision anything. Thanks!\n Some contextes:\n Long story short that paper just describes an idea where fixed-sized pre-allocated memory might be better for constantly allocated and deallocated objects.\n I just tried to extend it with features like: some sort of thread safety, creating \"new\" fixed-sized-pool when the last pool is full...\n My idea was simple use lock-free queue for \"thread-safe\" deallocation.\n Use thread_local for per thread allocation.\n And bad c++ template magic to abstract away the API calls.\n Regarding the syscall issue:\n Wrote a few small naive benchmarking programs for posix/linux platforms. If anybody has time to check it out a gcc compiler with c++ 20 support can build on a linux platform. benchmarks/build_benchmark.bash will download google's benchmark library and build it, otherwise one can edit it to just build the small programs which can be used with linux specific profiling tools gprof/perf(recommended to remove the -pg flag).\n    submitted by    /u/IamSanjidHaque    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Currently I use Conan for managing dependencies, as it was the package manager that supported the main dependencies of the program I’m developing. However, some libraries require other build managers or have cmakelists that don’t work with add_subfolder. In order to use them, I precompile those libraries as static or dynamic libraries (depending on the size and their update frequency) and then I link them using target_link_libraries. The entire build process is automated using a makefile.\n As a result, the project is not as clean and easy to maintain as I would like. Therefore, I’m looking for a package manager that can handle the building process itself, without requiring to call cmake (even if it doesn’t provide some of the libraries I use. It would also be nice if it could execute some custom shell commands before or after each stage of the building process to avoid using make (as an example, if I need to compile a library not provided by that package manager, it would be great if I could specify a the commands it should execute to achieve that in each platform, so they could be executed before compiling the program). \n Basically, I’d like to replace make, conan, cmake and ninja by a single software in new programs (something like cargo), while being able to call whatever was used (cmake, scons, Conan, vcpkg…) when building legacy libraries\n Do you know if there’s something like that available for C++? Every package manager I’ve checked requires using cmake\n Edit: I forgot to clarify that it needs to support cross platform development (I need to be able to support at least Linux and windows, as we don’t use apple computers)\n    submitted by    /u/No_Mongoose6172    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was reading an article about safe vs. unsafe languages and have a question about the following part:\n “C and C++ are unsafe in a strong sense: executing an erroneous operation causes the entire program to be meaningless, as opposed to just the erroneous operation having an unpredictable result. In these languages erroneous operations are said to have undefined behavior. The C FAQ defines “undefined behavior” like this: Anything at all can happen; the Standard imposes no requirements. The program may fail to compile, or it may execute incorrectly (either crashing or silently generating incorrect results), or it may fortuitously do exactly what the programmer intended.” (https://blog.regehr.org/archives/213)\n It says “Anything at all can happen.” My question is what are some examples of anything? Because I take it this means something as potentially insidious as there being virtually no correspondence between the original logic of the program and what it is actually doing.\n    submitted by    /u/anonymous_bear_6    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I coded in Java for a while (for school stuff) so I understand the basics such as variables, functions, control structures, and I've worked a bit with basic data structures like Arrays, LinkedLists, Stacks, and Queues in Java. I am also fairly familiar with OOP concepts like classes, polymorphism, method overriding and overloading, encapsulation, etc in Java (though not too confident about it just yet). But given that I am still pretty new to C++ and haven't been able to wrap my head around pointers yet (and I need to start learning Cpp as soon as possible because of academic needs).\n I tried learning Java by watching videos and referring to a fat textbook and textual resources online before diving into code as my dad wanted me to have a solid understanding of concepts before starting to write code, but it never really worked out and I could never grasp basic concepts effectively. I actually learnt Java solely by diving into questions from day 1 and looking up the concepts I have didn't understand. Should I do the same for C++? Also to familiarize myself... should I solve problems on Codewars/Leetcode or directly jump into basic projects like TICTACTOE or Hangman games to familiarize myself with the syntax and progressively increase the difficulty of the projects? There are so many different opinions and this is really complicating things for me. What would be your advice to your younger self who just started programming and is confused?

I imagine for some of the later features it is, but what about older language features in that list, like templates? \n \nIs the book dated? The latest edition covers C++11/14, and while my hunch is that not too much has changed that would affect best practices, I want to know people’s thoughts. \n \nAny additional/alternative resources that could be helpful that people recommend, or suggestions?\n \n Thanks \n    submitted by    /u/pussy_watchers    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Correct me if I am wrong. \n I would like to try learning something a bit more advanced, but it seems like every programming tutorial is either very basic or super advanced stuff without any explanation of what particular line of code is for. \n People say \"just do projects\", \"learn programming by programming\" and I don't find that very specific. I can't think of anything aside from video games or websites and those type of mini projects I mentioned. Could you give an example of what I could do at this point?

That’s up to the linking executable to define.\n Oddly when I compile the shared library I get an undefined symbol error surrounding the onStart function during its “linking” stage which is super confusing given its compiling a library what is it doing linking anything? I’ve checked and it’s definitely only building the shared library there shouldn’t be a linking stage? \n Like I’ve built shared libraries with dependencies in the past and I never had to link against those dependencies until the executable linking stage for obvious reasons- any ideas guys? Is some of my knowledge fundamentally wrong?\n    submitted by    /u/SimpleVertexArray    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I realize that this can be misused, but oh well.\n Provide pushing and popping as usual, with pop returning the owned value.\n Remove is_empty/empty, because I don't think they're that useful and can be approximated using the other functions anyway.\n  \nI don't have exception safety for types that can throw on construction among other cases, but here's a first attempt at something.\n Additionally, would it have been possible to provide a single implementation of push using some template feature I don't know about?

I'll remove this post if so.\n I haven't done any C or C++ since 2013-ish and want to pick the languages back up. Back then I had just finished school and briefly worked a job at a small shop where, being the lone C++ dev working entirely on my own, I learned nothing about best practices or anything, so I basically just installed dependencies locally and linked against them, and maybe ran valgrind every once in a blue moon, etc. I figure maybe that wasn't the best way to handle things, or even if it was maybe things have changed since then.\n Anyway, I was recently offered some work on a project and one of the requirements is that it must be either C or C++ and want to take a look at both again so I can decide which one I should use (plus I'm interested in exploring the game development field), so my question is: what's the most popular setup for a C/C++ dev environment? I'm talking besides IDE's/Text Editors, also tools for dependency management, static analysis, memory debugging/analysis, linters, etc. Basically anything people who are pros use to boost their productivity especially when they might be using the same PC for working on several projects...

Lambdas are able to take the reference or a copy of everything in the current scope. Lambdas are also syntatic sugar to create a structure with an overloaded operator ().

But it seems more logical to keep all declrations in the header and have this seperation.\n The second solution\n Ok, the next solution is to define everything and initialize in the header like this:\n ```cpp // consts.hpp\n pragma once\n const float PI = 3.14; ```\n It seems a better solution, but I kinda just don't like initializing in the header file; Also I am not sure how exactly #pragma once works, so, could it lead to some linker errors if I include consts.hpp in several files? As long as I know, it's gonna copy the content of header to files, does it mean I'll get several definitions of the const PI in multiple files? Each object will get its own constant? Or it corrects it and it's not just a simple straight forward copy?\n Thanks for your opinions.\n Edit: I am also curious about your opinion about inline variables and constexpr for this thing.\n    submitted by    /u/ArtinIr    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

To explain the arguments, this is a math expression consisting of integers and the operators +, -, and *. So if numbers = { 2, 4, 7 } and symbols = { -, * } then that means the expression is 2 - 4 * 7.\n However, we are not evaluating the expression with normal order of operations. Instead, symbolEvaluationOrder provides the order to evaluate the operators in, so if symbolEvaluationOrder = { 0, 1 } then that means the expression must be evaluated as (2 - 4) * 7 = -14 while if symbolEvaluationOrder = { 1, 0 } then the expression is evaluated as 2 - (4 * 7) = -26.\n With three integers this is easy.

          "description": "Today I stumbled over this warning message while tinkering with placement new in a larger project. To give a small outline of the scope: The goal was to create an error system in an embedded project with -fno-exception and avoiding expensive heap allocations. This is where the placement-new operator comes into play, because it allows creating abstracted error objects. Errors are global and stateful (hence the abstraction) and require a central user-defined location where these are stored. This requirement should be enforced at compile time.\n To find a solution I thought of enforcing a user-defined storage object using an extern declaration, which would throw a linker error if missing. But during testing I noticed that I instead got the compile warning (turned to an error via -Werror) from the title. The setup for that is very specific and also only works with non-zero optimization (-Og or -O1-3) \n So this got me wondering if there is any way to detect a missing storage location at compile time except linker warnings, so that I can provide a custom error message, because this pointer is null doesnt really tell the user anything, whereas undefined reference to storage does.\n I tried to narrow down the error and got the following code. Every line marked with // - was necessary to optimize for that warning.\n // compiled with g++ -c -O1 test.cpp #include <cstdint> #include <cstdio> #include <new> union Storage; static // - Storage *_StoragePtr; inline // - void setStorage(Storage *s) { _StoragePtr = s; } struct Error { virtual // - int foo() { return 1; } }; extern union Storage { Storage() { setStorage(this); } Error data; // example } storage; // user defined storage object // Storage storage; // - int main() { Error *error = new (_StoragePtr) Error(); printf(\"%i\", error->foo()); // - auto stuff = error->foo(); // - } \n    submitted by    /u/Symbroson    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to teach myself Cpp and I'm reading \"C++ Primer\" 5th Edition, and doing the exercises, and I just did exercise 1.4 where I converted an \"add two integers\" program into a \"multiply two integers\" program. I made the revisions, and built it without error, and ran it without error, at least on a variety of integers up to 4 digits long.\n But when I put in two larger integers (specifically, 56,789 and 67,890) the program ran and gave an answer that was not only the wrong number, but also was wrong in that it was negative (see screenshot below).\n https://i.ibb.co/648LVB5/Screenshot-20240615-140505.jpg\n Can anyone tell me why this happened? Could it be because the memory reserved for the calculation was not large enough for a product that had 10 digits?\n Also, I'm curious why I got a return value of 0 when there was clearly an error in the calculation somewhere.\n Finally, can anyone offer any advice on how to run down errors like this on my own without bugging redditors?

Are there other programming languages or skills I should focus more on? Are there remote or freelance opportunities I could pursue in the future?

But it doesn't work because I can't take or give engine as a parameter to my UI class because engine uses UI. \n What can I do? Should I change the structure of my project or am I just too dumb for not seeing any potential easy and simple solution? Any help is appreciated thank you.\n I didn't want to say it but please spare me for asking such questions actually I am a self taught student and I am not fond of reading big books about a language or watch multiple videos about a language.

When I'm not familiar with the code, I focus on identifying basic issues such as dereferencing null pointers, code smells, and any naming or comments that seem unclear or inappropriate. My team is highly competent, so I seldom find myself contributing significantly in these instances. I've noticed that many people, upon encountering unfamiliar code, choose not to review it at all.

My motivation stems from the current limitations of std::thread in terms of customization and the complexities encountered when applying std::async and std::future to classes and containers.\n I aim to streamline concurrent programming by introducing more intuitive and flexible APIs, reducing boilerplate code, and enhancing performance through intelligent resource management akin to thread pools. This new module would not replace but complement existing standards, offering developers a more powerful toolset for managing concurrency in modern, complex applications.\n I'm eager to gauge the C++ community's thoughts on this proposal.

I sotre operators as a char in stack a, and operands as a double in stack b. Then a switch function to do the math.\n  double applyOp(double a, double b, char op) { switch (op) { case '+': return a + b; case '-': return a - b; case '*': return a * b; case '/': return a / b; case '^': return pow(a, b); default: return 0; }  Currently I have to enter the expression as: 4 * ( 3 + 21 ); instead of: 4*(3+ 21). Another thing is this makes working with negative numbers slightly more difficult. I cannot enter: 3 * - 2 (no matter how I space it). Instead I have to enter any negative number as ( 0 - 2 ), which as you can imagine is very tedious. I want to be able to distinguish the numbers based on if there is an operator between them.

So, I try to practice that with std::is_constant_evaluated whether the contexpr function will be evaluated at compile time when it does not require a constant expression or not. Just for curious.\n Here is my code\n ```cpp\n include <type_traits>\n include <iostream>\n constexpr int compute(int x) { if (std::is_constant_evaluated()) { return x * x; // Compile-time branch } else { return x + x; // Runtime branch } }\n int main() { int result {compute(5)}; std::cout << \"Result: \" << result << std::endl; return 0; } ```\n I noticed that the website said gcc with -O2 compiler option will evaluate a constexpr function which isn't required constant expression at compile time. So I use the -O2 option to make the compiler evaluate.\n I expected that the result would be 25 when the constexpr function was evaluated at compile time. However, it returns 10. Obviously, this function was evaluated at runtime. I don't know why this happens. Is there anything I miss or misunderstand? \n Here is Compiler Explorer link\n    submitted by    /u/againsttheeverything    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello.\n Currently im during a process of developing an packer/protector for binary executables. Mainly for my self at the moment, but Im considering if there would be market for the solution. My solution would be an desktop GUI app, as well as shipped with CLI available binary (for servers aka CI/CD).\n The protector would work as follows:\n  \nLoad your binary into the protector.\n Select the protection mechanisms out of available in the protector GUI.\n Optionally save protection presets for future use, or for CLI use as well.\n Export protected binary\n  \nThe protection features would be:\n  \nAnti-debuggers protection\n Strings obfuscations\n Import obfuscations\n Code flow / disassembly obfuscations\n Anti-VM protection\n On the fly License Manager (create/modify a user licensed by EMAIL + KEY or HWID)\n Binary size compression\n  \nThe protector itself would be fully cross-platform solution. Meaning that the GUI and CLI tool could run the same way on Windows, Linux and MacOS machines. So the Linux host can manage Windows, MacOS and Linux binaries and vice-versa.\n At the beginning I would support only Windows binary protection, meaning that the protection of Windows EXE and DLL only would be available at the beggining. No Linux ELF executables, and no MacOS Mach-Os - those would be added in the future.\n The protector will make your binary nearly impossible to crack or even nearly impossible to investigate whats inside (lets assume that you don't want anyone to see how the communication with your remote backend server is done on the client side, as an example).\n Does anyone would be interested of using such soft? If no please tell why. Are you using any solution that is currently available on the market? If yes, please tell me what can be done better.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/arubahook_xapak    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, going through the www.learncpp.com tutorial and am just a bit confused about these statements. I am totally new to C++ so I am very likely missing something.\n Firstly, as I understand it, modern inline functions are used for creating functions which, mostly likely by being included as header files, could be redefined again, and this is done to prevent errors (the One Definition Rule). Importantly, all of these definitions must be the same, or else undefined behaviour.,-The%20linker%20will) will result.\n Secondly, inline functions are used in header-only libraries because if they are redefined by the user in their code, there will be no compilation errors to to a violition of the ODR.\n Given all this, the problem seems to be that a user whom #includes a header with a certain function may then define their own function of the same name, which will result in a compilation error by violating ODR.\n What I don't get is that, if instead the header function was inline, the user defining a new function by the same name will probably have a different definition for the function, which will result in undefined behaviour. Surely it is preferable to have a compilation error alerting you to the problem (allowing you to just rename your function) than undefined behaviour at runtime?\n    submitted by    /u/PurpleAmmonia    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In my personal hobby project, which is of a medium-largish size for a single developer, I use copious amounts of templates. I don't use a large amount of concepts, but there are a few places where I have needed their functionality. A good example is CRTP base class calling a derrived class' method non-virtually, and only if that method exists -- in essence, implementing Golang's implicit interfaces, non-virtually.\n Since the beginning, I thought that concepts would increase compile-times, since template-related stuff generally does. However, I recently added a decent amount of concepts to an internal graph library. I have not noticed any type of compilation slowdown at all. Again, I don't have a ton of concept usage, but there is a non-trivial amount. I am pleasantly surprised.\n I'm using the latest MSVC 2022\n How are other people's experience with compilation speed when using concepts? \n    submitted by    /u/vulkanoid    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

As my experience grows, the performance and features grow each generation. My previous engine is a Vulkan renderer with an Actor programming module and hundreds of features, smart caching, its blazing fast and incredibly complex. The number of engineers that understand the engine is small. \n My latest client requires an educational rendering framework, its really simple to read and understand, basic features and simplistic caching, and lacks the \"squeeze the last drop of performance out of the code\" design. The number of engineers that can understand the code is high. \n I must confess that I'm enjoying working in the simpler code base more. It lacks complexity, but also has less features and performance. I'm beginning to question whether extra complexity is really worth the hassle. Of course, it all depends on the target project. \n There is a comic that shows the journey from beginner to expert to guru, and the guru code matches the beginer code.\n Any gurus on Reddit willing to share their experience on how they approach new dev projects after doing the beginner->expert->guru journey.

          "description": "Hello\n I am trying to understand the way caching and prefetching works by playing around with a raspberry pi 3b.\n I have a piece of code which empties my cache and then traverses an array. To make a long story short, since the traversal of my array is linear (hence spatial locality) and almost nothing else is done besides traversing it (hence temporal locality), unless I get preempted, data should get cached. The fact that I traverse my array linearly implies that it is also very easy to predict what next data will be accessed allowing my CPU's prefetcher to do its job and therefor never experience cache misses. Yet, I still see consistent cache misses at every 64th byte (i.e. 16th index in the case of this experiment).\n Code: https://pastebin.com/raw/Mp85NDEW\n corresponding output: https://pastebin.com/raw/evXmggBf \n You'll see that the access times of 38, 54, 70, 86, 102 are high which is exactly 64 bytes apart every single time.\n I was wondering whether anybody would have some clues about why I am seeing these consistent misses at what corresponds to the end of a cache line?\n EDIT: prefetching is enabled at the hardware level\n    submitted by    /u/blueMarker2910    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Generally speaking such systems are pretty infectious within a codebase so choosing wisely is quite valuable.

In that vein I was hoping to get some insight from people who have used the following libraries as to how they are once deployed; are there unexpected issues or benefits, any regrets; maybe it is rock-solid and doesn't get a second thought? \n  \nAbseil Status\n Boost LEAF\n {Boost,} Outcome\n tl::expected\n std::expected \n  \nWhile there are many differences between the above libraries it seems that perhaps the biggest, in API terms, is whether or not the error type is universal or not. absl::Status has a single error type for all possible errors, whereas the other libraries seem to take a bring-your-own approach. I'm more used to Abseil's approach and was curious about people's experience with writing their own. Do you write many error types and have to convert (perhaps noisily?) between them, do you end up with one big error type that you use most places, etc?

          "description": "Recently I switched to clangd in vscode and have some troubles using it - the first is that code completion options it provides quite rarely used and to get some simple std::cout I have to manually type it completely. Second is that it doesn't provide completion of keywords like template, typename and so on. The last but not least is that it enables auto insertion of angled brackets (for types in templates) and braces for functions, nevertheless those are disabled in vscode itself. I haven't found any meaningful lists of commands in google, so it'll be nice to get some help on that.

          "description": "Im experimenting with template stuff. I have this code to create worker threads that execute a templated function in their own thread. It looks like this:\n #include <atomic> #include <thread> #include <type_traits> template<auto Func> class WorkerThreadFactory { public: template<typename... Args> class WorkerThread { private: using result_type = std::invoke_result_t<decltype(Func)&, Args...>; std::thread thread_; result_type result_; std::atomic_bool complete_; public: bool complete() { return complete_; } result_type& result() { return result_; } WorkerThread(Args &&... args) { complete_ = false; thread_ = std::thread{ [&result_ = result_, &complete_ = complete_](Args &&... args_inner) { result_ = Func(std::forward<Args>(args_inner)...); complete_ = true; }, std::forward<Args>(args)... }; } }; template<typename... Args> auto make(Args &&... args) { return WorkerThread<Args...>(std::forward<Args>(args)...); } }; \n Now if I have a function that takes in non-ref arguments, so far it works fine. E.g.:\n int add(int a, int b) { return a+b; } int main() { auto add_worker = WorkerThreadFactory<add>{}; auto worker = add_worker.make(1, 2); \n However, if the argument needs to be a reference, like so, it fails:\n int add(int &a, int &b) { return a+b; } int main() { int a = 1; int b = 2; auto add_worker = WorkerThreadFactory<add>{}; auto worker = add_worker.make(a, b); \n I believe this is because if an argument is passed by reference, you have to pass in that argument with std::ref to std::thread. Is there a modification I can make to this line that will correctly pass in the arguments as needed for any arbitrary function?\n result_ = Func(std::forward<Args>(args_inner)...); \n    submitted by    /u/Raknarg    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

(https://www.vobarian.com/collisions/2dcollisions2.pdf)\n the first on is effective but not very interesting from a simulation perspective : it doesn't take collision energy in account.\n The second approach is way better but i can't find a way to handle collisions when the density is too important: this approach doesn't move the particle, it edit the speed vectors. in a sparse world, it works perfectly. When the world is dense ( of particles) the algorithm tends to push a particle inside another one : \n Particle A and B collides, so the algo changes the vector speed of the two particles, then the position is updated using real world physics. but it happens a lot that after this operation , partiicle A or B is now colliding with particle C. In this order it's not a problem because C will be processed afterwards. But if after collision between B and C one particle is inside or colliding with A, ill have exactly the opposite behavior : they are now attached or one is included in another one. \n I suppose this is a standard problem when you want to use real world physics and not just verlet. it had been adressed a lot of times i hope...\n Do you have any ressources on this subject ? i know how to use google.\n    submitted by    /u/Technical_Weight42    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think I understood the basic intent of constexpr and what it tries to tell the compiler in terms of optimization. However I often hesitate using constexpr since I don't really profile the runtime performance of single functions or the compilation times (with or without using it). In addition, I think that it often can't be used if you heavily use concepts like polymorphism and therefore may even extend the compilation time. \n TLDR: I want to use it more to optimize my runtime performance, but miss a clear guidline when it should be used. Due to my concerns regarding compile times, I wouldn't place it everywhere in the code. As a programmer: Maybe a static code analysis tool would be great that notifies me if it might be useful.

Model include a class World, a class Wordable and a class Particle\n World is just the dimensions of the world\n Wordable is a class object that is on the grid (the word), so this class manage forces, acceleration speed position and collision. Wordable is never instantiated, so this is an abstract or virtual class (if i understand correctly) Particle is one child class of Wordable , i have severals Wordable chidren because i can have different type of particle like a particle with a mass or not (photon for example), another particle class with other parameters (like TTL) and so on,\n For the coordinates system i use broadly a very simple struct Vec2D { float x; float y; auto get2D(return sf::Vector2f{x,y} -> sf::Vector2f; (get2D is used because i draw with SFML)\n i was wondering where to put this Struct ?\n at this time this struct is in particle.h. wordable.h include particle.h\n model.h include wordable.h \n mview.h include model.h \n main.cpp include mview. \n first i dont really like this because everything is included also where it's not used/ Second, if i have two or more derived classes of Wordable, i ll have to copy the struct definition in all derived classes, or create a new file with just the struct and include it in all derived classes.\n but it sounds tedious and i multiply definitions for nothing. \n What would be your strategy ? \n i'm a beginner, about 1 years of C++ but i have played a lot with classes in php and js in another life\n    submitted by    /u/Technical_Weight42    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Constructors, getter, setter and overloaded operators (these work)\n .\n Now want to define a function std::vector<T> const& getStorage() const, that returns a const reference to mData, I can't see why my (likely naive) function doesn't work:\n T const& getStorage() const{\n return this -> mData;\n }\n It won't compile when I try to call the function (in my main.cpp). I get the error:\n ./Vector.hpp:165:16: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'const std::vector<double>' to function return type 'const double'\n I initially understood it as std::vector<T> and T being of the same type?\n If I instead write the function as:\n std::vector<T> const& getStorage() const{\n return this -> mData;\n }\n It does compile and run, but when I try to print the result (either in form my main, or directly from within getStorage() ) I get the error:\n invalid operands to binary expression ('basic_ostream<char, char_traits<char> >' and 'const std::vector<double>')\n So,\n What exactly is the difference between my first- and second approach?\n And why can't I do:\n std::cout << \"getStorage test: \" << vect.getStorage() << std::endl;\n (I would expect to get a print of the address of the first element of the vect. Now I'm questioning if that is even reasonable to expect)\n (Also, I've tried without progress using: const_refrence and data() (from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/vector-class?view=msvc-170#data ) But I'm not sure how to actually use them in my class)\n Any advice is much appreciated.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/jonas6000    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Blend2D 0.11.1 has been released and regardless of the conservative version number the project is progressing and offering more features & optimizations than before.\n Blend2D started in 2015 as an experiment to use a JIT compiler for generating 2D pipelines. It was written for fun with no intention of releasing it. However, because of the excellent results it was indeed released in 2019 under Zlib license and tagged as Beta. The initial version only targeted X86 hardware in its JIT compiler, which was a serious limitation.\n Blend2D's development never stopped and during the years it got new features such as multi-threaded rendering, AVX2 & AVX-512 optimizations, dithered gradients, and even cherries such as SIMD-optimized TrueType font outlines decoding. However, the most important feature, which is AArch64 support, is now part of 0.11.1 release. It means out of box support for AArch64 based SoCs and Apple Silicon.\n Interestingly, the rendering performance is really great on Apple Silicon and in many cases it's even better against competing libraries than on X86 hardware. Results from running a Blend2D benchmarking tool on Apple M3 Pro hardware are available on the Performance page (https://blend2d.com/performance.html) together with AMD Ryzen 9 7950X dataset for comparison. Users can also run their own tests and visualize their results on the Performance page via a \"Custom Dataset\" functionality. The benchmarking tool now outputs JSON after all tests finish.\n Blend2D homepage: https://blend2d.com\n Blend2D fiddle: https://fiddle.blend2d.com\n    submitted by    /u/Asm2D    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I do isc;, isc; I will extract both H and I but when I call is>>c; again I get the issue. You might say “you need to check if any flags are raised” but .eof() or any of the other checkers don’t indicate anything.\n I’ve heard that istreams have their end flag raised by a terminating character, usually \\n.

As an amateur though. So i'm a beginner, don't be too harsh :)\n I ve coded a iteration of conway game of life for educational purpose, it works fine and i'm really happy with it. the actual version runs 100* faster than my first version :).

Each key (an int defined by GLFW_KEY_*) has a corresponding callback function. I would just reference the appropriate key in the map to get the function associated with that key. \n I'm having a lot of trouble getting it up. At first I created the unordered map and tried to just insert callback functions, but because they're member function of class Camera and don't have an associated object yet, and because the functions are non-static, I can't do that. So, I'm trying to use lambda functions to get the map populated. Here is the code that I have so far:\n std::unordered_map<int, std::function<void()>> cameraKeyBindings; void Camera::insertCallbackFunction(int key, void(Camera::*)() function) { cameraKeyBindings.insert(key, [this, function]() {(this->*function)(); }); } void Camera::setcameraKeyBindings() { insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_W, &Camera::linearAccelerationUp); insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_A, &Camera::linearAccelerationLeft); insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_S, &Camera::linearAccelerationDown); insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_D, &Camera::linearAccelerationRight); } \n The main problem right now is that there appears to be something wrong with the syntax:\n void(Camera::*)() \n My compiler gives this error:\n error: expected ‘,’ or ‘...’ before ‘function’\n void insertCallbackFunction(int key, void(Camera::*)() function);\n Unfortunately from what I can find, that seems to be the correct way to declare a member function pointer.

This book, however is old. REALLY old. My question is: what are you guys' thoughts on the book? Is it too old to be relevant to modern industry landscape or is it still relevant enough to be a good introduction to oop and software creation with c++?\n    submitted by    /u/memesdotpng    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm sure I'm doing it wrong in many ways since I have 0 experience in the field, but at least it works for now !\n So here are my two questions :\n  \nMy program is built so I have a Node class, and every line of the source code I'm parsing is a specialization of this class (StatementNode, AssignmentNode, FunctionDeclarationNode...). I have a m_root variable as part of my Parser class, and every time I parse a line of code, I append the newly created node to m_root. Then I plan to have a to_asm() method that would traverse the tree, following each std::unique_ptr<Node> next pointer owned by each Node. The thing is, I'm not sure this is th…",

          "description": "I’m new to C++, so this may be a naive question.\n The project I’ve been working on for over one year is a very large C++ software with only one cpp file, the main.cpp. I guess there are hundreds of header files. Not really sure.\n The thing is it takes over 3 minutes to recompile, just for one small fix. I’ve seen people saying cpp/hpp implementation/interface structure is more suitable to large C++ software, so I think perhaps I should give it a try.\n But honestly I don’t know where to start. How should one approach this daunting task? I mean, it looks like in each header file, there are always over 10 header files included. So it is really hard to find a place where I can divide some piece of the header file into cpp/hpp to reduce compile time.\n And I wonder if there is some general rules for such a refactorization? \n Sorry for my limited English. English is not my first language, but I’m trying my best to make it as clear as possible. Thank you! \n    submitted by    /u/AbeL-Musician7530    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

What I’m asking is whether cpp has evolved enough, and whether it might continue to evolve enough, that it could be used as an alternative to languages like rust which come with a lot of safety features at the outset? \n Or is it a bit like a car? Modern cars have airbags and seatbelts and so on. With a very old car you can retrofit seatbelts and airbags and such but it might always be a little bit ‘hack’, since it hasn’t necessarily been engineered into the design from the bottom up?\n    submitted by    /u/anonymous_bear_6    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I’ve been having trouble installing or utilizing v3 and ended up giving up on the transition; I’m on Linux so this might be an issue of v2 still being around and used silently.)\n I had learned about object files a while back, but mostly just tucked them away into the mental box of “things that exist but I don’t understand when I would need them”. Now, I found a case where I need them!\n From now on, with Catch2 v2, I’m writing unit test files that #include headers with my function declarations, but I compile them to object files without linking. Thus, I’m able to go through the long compile time once per unit test .cpp file (barring future additions to such a file), and then iterate on the function definitions until the test passes, without needing to go through the long compile time whenever I update the function!\n I realize this is a fairly basic thing in anyone’s C++ journey, but it was magical for me in understanding the “why” behind some compiler features.\n    submitted by    /u/DatBoi_BP    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know I can just override the getter in all my child classes, but then what's the point of inheriting the parent class at all?\n Edit: I really should've thought more about the title lol, and should've added some code. \n First, some context. I'm designing a terminal chess application. I have a piece class (kinda abstract) which has private attributes type and color\n There are different subclasses pawn, rook, etc. And their type attribute is initialised appropriately in each.\n Code (typing from mobile, forgive me)\n ```\n class Piece { private: PieceType: type = PieceType::NONE; PieceColor: color;\n public: PieceType getType() { return type; } }\n class Pawn : public Piece { private: PieceType type = PieceType::PAWN; } ```\n And in some other main function Pawn pawn; pawn.getType();\n Now this getType returns NONE, why doesn't it get the type attribute of the child and gets that of the parent? Currently I'm working around this by having a setter in parent and calling it for each child instance \n    submitted by    /u/frankstan33    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a private property of a class that keeps resetting itself, seemingly by magic. I have no clue why this could be happening as the property is only set to true in one place, but it is never executed more than once with this bug happening. I have looked at everything I could think of online to try to find an answer, I have tried changing the bool to an int or string and setting the values to anything else. I have stepped through the execution of my code line by line in visual studio with a watch on the property and it just magically sets itself to whatever I use as true. I made a branch of my project with this bug that can be found here: https://github.com/JordanDHayes/SDL-testing-1/tree/Broken \n The property in question is needsUpdate of the windowHandler class. It sets itself to true at the beginning of the update method in the window class after it has been set to true once before, line 105 of \"WindowHandler.cpp\".

I'm currently coming back to it, and I find it strange I haven't come across some nifty speed increases.\n The main thing I wish, was there to be pre-compile annotations like Lombok for Java. Yes, it's a little 'eh' but there's a deLombok feature for release builds. @Getters/@Setters are just nice. @Builders too.\n I've seen a lot of headache over \"header-only\" builds. Seems to be fine for what I'm doing. Im using Qt, so not always avoidable. A nice refactoring tool doesn't seem to be showing up anywhere though? Be nice to just have a combined file type, and let the IDE index changes and auto produce appropriate h/cpp files to avoid linker confusion down the road. \n I know C++ might get reflection in the upcoming new feature releases 45 years from now, but a lot of this could be handled like preprocessor commands I'd think.\n PS: Yes. I know I'm probably having some legacy C++ devs fuming right now. I just want to have faster development times on personal side projects.

Wouldn't this also break the application, since the app would use the libc++ deployed by the OS, located at /usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib?

You’ll find that the C++ language specification leaves everything wide open; it doesn’t define packages in any way. Headers just show up somehow, and the language spec doesn’t care how. As a result, every possible way of installing and finding headers and libraries is already in use, and a package manager would have to accommodate all of them. Good luck with that nonsense.

It's more code to write obviously. It's good in terms of separation of concerns though. First get the raw string from the initial stream object (e.g. std::cin) and then do the actual extraction and validation operations on the temporary ispanstream object.\n But my question is that is this approach overkill for getting input from the user? And is it bad in terms of performance (how fast is ispanstream)?\n I know that many just don't use std::istringstream since it's got some noticable overhead.

Raw pointers and smart pointers are mixed, a bunch of int[] stuff, and the dynamic_cast stuff really make us no way to start. The leader decides to refactor the codebase so that it's easier to continue to work. \n We decided to use Google c++ style. First we used clang-format to make code looks more consistent. The next step is changing variables. Then what to do? How to efficiently refactor the member function with no return value to a function at least return a status code and other things like forbidding RTTI?

          "description": "For the past 8 years I was primary SRE/DevOps/Platform Engineer. I used various programming languages (Python, JS, TS, Groovy) but the most of the projects were small and the complexity came rather from poor architectural decisions (all in into serverless) rather from the business logic.\n I noticed that my programming muscles started to atrophy when I started writing a Terraform provider. I decided to shift away from SRE related work back towards developing software. Go was my choice because it fits the area where I am mostly active (cli, tooling and backend). I noticed that many devs from different ecosystems (Rust, Java, C++ etc.) scoff on golang for being too simple. I don't think that is really the case.\n For one, It took me a lot of time to familiarise with the Go's stdlib that is quite extensive. Writing idiomatic Go code is not that easy since the language is quite unique in many ways (concurrency, error handling, types, io.Reader and io.Writer). On top of that memory management is quite bizarre. I get the pointers without pointer arithmetic. I really enjoy all of this, I just think using it as intended is not that simple as some state outright.\n I get a little defensive because I am quite experienced engineer and It clearly took longer than expected to learn the Go. The language that supposed to be \"simple\" and to quote Rob Pike:\n  \nThe key point here is our programmers are Googlers, they’re not researchers. They’re typically, fairly young, fresh out of school, probably learned Java, maybe learned C or C++, probably learned Python. They’re not capable of understanding a brilliant language but we want to use them to build good software. So, the language that we give them has to be easy for them to understand and easy to adopt.\n  \nThat is a little condescending because it should be the logic/product to be complex and brilliant - not the programming language. It is like criticising a sculpturer for using a simple chizzle.\n    submitted by    /u/b1-88er  \n [link]   [comments]",

The library is implemented via the REST API provided by Ecoflow.\n In this version I've implemented API for all devices mentioned in the Ecoflow documentation:\n  \nPower Stations (regular ecoflow power stations, like Delta 2, River 2, etc)\n Power Stations (PRO)\n Smart Plug\n PowerStream Micro Inverter\n Smart Home Panel\n Wave Air Conditioner\n Glacier\n  \nUsing the library you can get all parameters available from the device and change device's settings (each device has its own list of settings).\n I've tested it on my two devices: Delta 2 and River 2. \n I don't expect much more development on this library, since it covers everything available in the official documentation. I might update it when (or if) anything is changed in the documentation.\n My personal use case is https://github.com/tess1o/go-ecoflow-exporter - the Prometheus exporter that fetches the metrics and Grafana Dashboard where I can see all the metrics in one place.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Former-Emergency5165  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I would like to initiate a discussion about a software architecture case I am currently facing at the company I work for, and get your opinions on how I can improve the application's architecture.\n I built an application in Java 17, using Spring Boot 2.7, about 6 months ago. This application handles approximately 20k RPM, with an average response time of 60-80ms. As the initiative for which this application was proposed started generating a lot of money, the product team decided that this same functionality should be available in other parts of the main sales site. This change will cause the application to receive around 500k RPM in the coming months.\n This application does not involve any heavy processing; it only makes API calls to fetch delivery information and returns it. A significant part of the response time is due to waiting for other applications. With this increase in traffic, I am exploring how to improve its performance to avoid issues and reduce response time. We have a load balancer and instance scaling system that will manage the platform.\n I plan to upgrade the application to use Spring 3.2 and Java 21, so I can use Java's virtual threads to improve throughput, as we have some parallel calls.\n One of my colleagues suggested that we change the application from Java to Go, but I believe that in this case, we would not have significant gains, except for faster scaling. I think this because the application's workflow mainly involves waiting for responses from other APIs. What do you think about this? Would it be worth switching this application to Go? What gains would we have?\n Instance resources are not a problem because we use the smallest machine available on our platform, and even so, it has plenty of resources left over\n    submitted by    /u/SemFutur0  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In regards to the new 'iterators' coming in Go 1.23, I stumbled upon some blog posts and chatter on social media talking about how this is an unnecessary language change. I was somewhat aware of the proposal and thought the func(func(T)bool) bool was a bit odd but after seeing this, I started investigating further and contributing to the discussion on https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61897\n I've always thought channels are the obvious choice for representing iterators (as they represent a stream, queue or sequence of values), naturally I assumed there must be a good reason why the language had to change the spec in order to support iterators (instead of adding compiler optimisations for channels to support this, I've even gone into some detail on how this could be implemented efficiently).\n The reaction I've received, however, is bizarre? I've been told it's too late to comment on this, it's already been decided. That channels must not be used for this (technically they can be used as iterators). Instead Go is adding special case functions to the language spec and a special case package iter just to support the same language semantics as receive-only channels?\n I've always considered Go (and the community) to be very cautious about making languages changes, not to add duplicate ways of representing the same thing. Pushing a cohesive and simple design. I'm curious, is it just me feeling like there is a major shift in principles here and is there anybody else who has had a look at this and thought the built-in channels are the obvious answer here?\n    submitted by    /u/Splizard  \n [link]   [comments]",

These days, I can't provide good reasoning to my team for why we should use the OO approach(the approach example in the link) or just use plain functions without receivers.\n I see a lot of Go code using an OO approach, especially creation patterns like the Factory pattern, Builder pattern, and Singletons. There's a lot of encapsulation tied to structs and interfaces with methods in them. I understand that Go is not a fully OO language and uses a mixture of OO, functional, and imperative programming.\n But we seem very confused about which approach is the best. My vision is the following:\n  \nUsing certain OO creational patterns in packages.\n Using receivers in package functions where it makes sense and the rest is imperative.\n  \nCan the Go community tell me what is the golden middle?\n My manager wrote a package that contains just functions. My suggestion was that we should use the Factory pattern with a NewSomething() function that returns a struct.

After finding the command, even typing that becomes annoying since you have to type two commands most times (one for getting the id or name of the object, which I do most times, and the other for the actual command). I felt this whole thing could be streamlined. \n Sure, GUI docker management tools exist but I did not want to open a browser that takes half my RAM (electron duh..) and then use my mouse to point and click buttons for a task like this.\n Enter goManageDocker, a simple TUI tool that lets you manage your docker objects with a single keystroke (seriously), it has vim keybinds for easy navigation and you can do any action with a single keystroke! All of these for a few megabytes of RAM too!!\n If this does pique your interest, you can find the repo here!.\n I'm open to any feedback as well. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Krunchy_Almond  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't understand how the Java code differs from the Go code in satisfying this criterion of static interface/flexible implementation. They both look the same to me. In both cases the client defines an interface and the publisher (logic provider) implements some logic object conforming to that interface. In both cases, the main() function constructs a client object using the logic object and calls the `process' function defined by the logic object. What am I missing here?\n Java code:\n public interface Logic { String process(String data); } public class LogicImpl implements Logic { public String process(String data) { // business logic } } public class Client { private final Logic logic; // this type is the interface, not the implementation public Client(Logic logic) { this.logic = logic; } public void program() { // get data from somewhere this.logic.process(data); } } public static void main(String[] args) { Logic logic = new LogicImpl(); Client client = new Client(logic); client.program(); } \n Here's the Go implementation\n type LogicProvider struct {} func (lp LogicProvider) Process(data string) string { // business logic } type Logic interface { Process(data string) string } type Client struct{ L Logic } func(c Client) Program() { // get data from somewhere c.L.Process(data) } main() { c := Client{ L: LogicProvider{}, } c.Program() \n }\n    submitted by    /u/pakraaaw  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just add some sync.Mutex at critical places? It adds a little overhead timewise though not critical. A more elegant approach is to send all this data back to main using a channel?

These interface definitions are not stable since they are broken every time a service adds a new operation.\n Usage of *iface should be replaced by scoped caller-defined interfaces for the service operations being used:\n // V1 import \"io\" import \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3\" import \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3/s3iface\" func GetObjectBytes(client s3iface.S3API, bucket, key string) ([]byte, error) { object, err := client.GetObject(&s3.GetObjectInput{ Bucket: &bucket, Key: &key, }) if err != nil { return nil, err } defer object.Body.Close() return io.ReadAll(object.Body) } // V2 import \"context\" import \"io\" import \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3\" type GetObjectAPIClient interface { GetObject(context.Context, *s3.GetObjectInput, ...func(*s3.Options)) (*s3.GetObjectOutput, error) } func GetObjectBytes(ctx context.Context, client GetObjectAPIClient, bucket, key string) ([]byte, error) { object, err := api.GetObject(ctx, &s3.GetObjectInput{ Bucket: &bucket, Key: &key, }) if err != nil { return nil, err } defer object.Body.Close() return io.ReadAll(object.Body) } \n My Thoughts\n I understand why AWS does not want to maintain a separate interface package in v2. Their reasoning is that they break whenever something is added. However, I thought the interfaces were very simple and convenient to use.\n I also know that Go prescribes defining interfaces where you actually consume, however, the AWS methods are always very verbose and when I copy the methods that I use I have to remove the named parameters when converting. Overall, feels like a worse DX to me, but that comes with the go territory. Does anyone else have thought?\n    submitted by    /u/whatswiththe  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are loosely following hexagonal architecture. On the JVM, I would creat multiple modules that then have their package structure like app-a/domain, app-a/adapters, app-b/domain etc where app-a is the module.\n Currently, I have something close to this:  ❯ tree . ├── db │ ├── migration │ │ └── 000.sql │ ├── sqlite.go │ └── store.go ├── discord │ ├── client.go │ └── message.go ├── domain │ ├── filter\\_test.go │ ├── filters.go │ ├── import\\_matches.go │ ├── match.go │ └── store.go  where db, discord and domain are separate packages.

I had experience using echo, so this was the one I chose.\n These types needed to be inferred, they would not be explicitly given in any way. You are not allowed to use any api generation tools like swagger or blueprint.\n Overall, I was unable to complete the challenge the way they wanted, I wrote a solution where the user needed to pass req and resp types when registering a handler.\n Looking at it now, this is as far I as can get. I'm assuming you would need to call the function and and use reflection on the response to know its type, but im still really uncertain as to how to properly call this handler function without knowing the request type.\n https://go.dev/play/p/OH5V1cR43FZ\n I'm at my wits' end, so any help would be greatly appreciated.\n edit:\n After long discussions with helpful people in this forum, its clear this coding challenge was disingenuous. A solution would rely on this theoretical api server's documentation strategies. E.g. one could expect to pull this information from struct tags (if the server was implemented in go).\n This wasn't a coding challenge, this was the company looking for a solution to a problem they had, and got free labor in the process. It makes sense that the position was \"conveniently\" dropped after the coding challenge.\n Stay careful out there yall and be mindful of what you apply to.\n    submitted by    /u/astonishinglylaw  \n [link]   [comments]",

For so long I've been thinking that a struct is a type and then there's just different versions of it... and yeah these might be their own types but it was never a conscious thought in my mind... they both just blurred together.\n Here, https://imgur.com/a/UTUpZcN we can see that I've got the part highlighted. I'm declaring it in the long var way just to be clear about how the type is on the left of equals and the literal is on the right. The type sentient is simply a named type for that struct. But of course this makes a whole new type. Just like how I can have two floats be different types (one Celsius and another Fahrenheit) to keep them conceptually different. They couldn't be combined.

However, I noticed on Godbolt than on x86 architecture, leading_zeros was compiled into bsf instruction, and because because bsf doesn't support zero, compiler has to add a test before and a conditional branching.\n I know that lzcnt exists now, and it can be enabled using -C target-feature=+lzcnt, as explained here, but that's not the subject of this post.\n So I've wrote a branchless version of `u64::leading_zeros*, that you can find on the playground. We can verify on Godbolt that there is no more branching.\n EDIT: as suggested in comment, the following version is simpler https://godbolt.org/z/1qYeG6cbo\n Obviously, I've no idea of the performance of this function just by looking at the assembly, and I don't really expect it to be faster; at least, performance should be consistent. However, I don't have an x86 architecture to bench it (Apple Silicon spotted), so I decided to write a Reddit post to ask if there are interested folks who would mind doing it and share the results 😬\n If I could, I would do a benchmark with multiple random numbers, to mess with CPU branch prediction, and also a benchmark with only one number, to (maybe) help the CPU.

Everything was going to plan, I got the memory map, GDT, IDT, TSS setup, serial drivers, NVME drivers until I went into paging. See usually, most of my kernels at max were using around 2 pages worth of stack (or 4096*2 bytes in total) which seems like a fairly reasonable size given that the kernel is really only meant to just initialize some stuff before starting the processes and drivers that really take up more memory themselves or allocate any big buffers in the memory map. \n (The following is just information I've quickly found online about the compiler + some of my limited testing, so please correct me if I get anything wrong with how the compiler works):\n That assumption was thrown out the window, because …",

Version 0.4.0 has these changes:\n  \nCrate is finally completely no-std.\n Moved some error checks to compile time.\n Added default functions to all modules, known to never cause any error, for users who just want the solution and don't care about the computational parameters.\n Added \"custom\" functions for more advanced users who still want to tweak the computation parameters.\n Updated documentation and examples.\n  \nI love to hear your feedback.

Implementing this trait is unsafe but straight-forward, and once implemented everything else is safely enforced using the type system.\n Notable features:\n  \nFully replicates the std::any module\n Near-identical API for 'static types with small changes for transient types\n Supports any number of generic type/lifetime/const parameters\n No external dependencies without feature-gates\n Includes a (feature-gated) derive macro for the Transient trait\n ProvidesTransient impls for many stdlib types\n Provides (feature-gated) Transient impls for some foreign types - feel free to request more!\n Extensive documentation including numerous examples\n Permissive MIT/APACHE-2.0 dual license\n  \nI decided to make this crate after running into the 'static-only limitation of the stdlib version on multiple occasions, such as when I wanted to erase the type of an ndarray::ArrayView<'v, T, D> to pass it through generic-forbidding code and ended up having to clone the data instead.

My understanding of how they work is that shaders run on the gpu, that output is used somehow to create ✨graphics✨; and I know that opengl, vulkan, etc can help with that. I would think that wgpu would be similar.\n  \nwgpu is a safe and portable graphics library for Rust based on the WebGPU API. It is suitable for general purpose graphics and compute on the GPU.\n Applications using wgpu run natively on Vulkan, Metal, DirectX 12, and OpenGL ES; and browsers via WebAssembly on WebGPU and WebGL2.\n  \nbut this (the description from wgpu homepage) is tripping me up. if wgpu serves the same purpose as opengl and vulkan, what does it mean for it to \"run\" on one of those? based on that description, presumably wgpu is more generic than opengl or vulkan, but if so, what can it actually do? and if one is trying to make an application that has graphics, would one only need wgpu? or would they need other stuff?\n furthermore, what do these libraries provide beyond just shaders? do they somehow make it easier to use them? if graphics are on the gpu, then why is there a non-shader interface at all? what does that provide?\n    submitted by    /u/Critical_Ad_8455  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since then, RMK envolves a loooooooooot. Now I'd happy to annouce that RMK hits v0.2.0, with a bunch of exciting new features.\n The following is a simple list of important updates from v0.1.0.\n  \nWireless support for nRF52 and esp32. RMK now supports BLE/USB dual mode with auto-switch feature\n A new configuration system based on toml. Now you can config almost everything of your keyboard with a single keyboard.toml, no Rust code is required! This makes RMK more user-friendly. If you want do more customization, you can still\n A new rapid debouncer, which would trigger the key first and then do debouncing\n Interrupt triggered matrix scanning, which reduces power consumption a lot\n Support more advanced keyboard feature: mouse key, media key and tap/hold feature\n Documentation and project-template got improved a lot\n  \nI also did some measurement about the performance and power consumption of RMK firmware. According to my testing on my nRF52840 GH60 board(open-sourced as rmk-ble-keyboard), the key latency of RMK is about 2 ms in wired mode and 10 ms in wireless(BLE) mode. The power consumption is about 200ua when advertising, 450ua when idling and 2ma when typing, which means RMK could provide about 2-3 months battery life with a 2000mah battery.\n In the duration of implementing RMK, I got lots of help from Rust community. The Rust community is so great. Also, the great tooling provided by Rust makes the dev experience quite pleasurable. Finally, I'm looking forward to more feedbacks about the project. Any kinds of suggestions/feedbacks are welcome :D\n Project link: https://github.com/haobogu/rmk\n    submitted by    /u/haobogu_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Stronger question, why aren't any of the PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd and Ord traits (I would call them PEPO) unsafe?\n From the Rust Nomicon:\n  \nOn trait declarations, unsafe means that implementors of the trait must check the trait documentation to ensure their implementation maintains the contracts the trait requires.\n  \nThe PEPO traits have requirements which have to be upheld by implementors. Thus it would be natural for them to be unsafe, this is even suggested in the same chapter of the Nomicon. When the traits aren't marked as unsafe but have requirements unsafe code must assume the trait contracts don't always hold. I can also easily imagine a safe function implicitly relying on the reflexivity of Eq for example and thus behaving differently than it should, breaking it's own safe invariants.\n The reason behind not marking PEPO traits as unsafe is explained in the same chapter of the Nomicon:\n  \nThe decision of whether to mark a trait unsafe is an API design choice. A safe trait is easier to implement, but any unsafe code that relies on it must defend against incorrect behavior. Marking a trait unsafe shifts this responsibility to the implementor. Rust has traditionally avoided marking traits unsafe because it makes Unsafe Rust pervasive, which isn't desirable.\n  \nThis confuses me. How would marking the PEPO traits as unsafe make them harder to implement, when the trait contracts would be exactly the same and also, don't the benefits of marking the PEPO traits as unsafe outweigh the drawbacks?

          "description": "Hello Rustaceans\n I have been learning Rust and coming from Java I have to say it has been very refreshing.\n I just love the heavy use of sum types (enums) throughout the language, especially `Option` and `Result` that are far better than `null`s and exceptions. I like matching, I like macro that can sometimes feel like magic and others compile time control, I like that everything is immutable by default. The borrow checker forces me to understand the memory well which gives me a lot more confidence when mutating something (in Java, you don't own the object, and you don't know if some other part of the program holds a reference to it, so you're not very sure what part of the program would be affected by the mutation)\n However it seems to me that all the things that I love are the high level part of the language and the inspiration it took from functional programming.\n Sure I appreciate the language is very fast and that the same language can be used on bare metal, but it is not very useful to me, it never was a grievance to Java for me after all. The borrow checker can sometimes be annoying and although a high level language, it sometimes forces me to have low level considerations.\n The low level part although useful and interesting, is not very relevant to me, and I wonder what I could trade against this part of the language. In other words what could a high level only Rust look like? Could you make any suggestions of languages that can fit this description? I am thinking something with no nulls or exceptions, statically typed, with some emphasis on function purity, with algebraic data types and reasonably fast (something competitive to Java)\n I am thinking something like gleam, haskell or elm maybe but I would like to hear your thoughts and if you would take the trade-off.\n Thank you for reading me\n    submitted by    /u/Locarito  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here's a link: https://crates.io/crates/lazy_errors\n I started learning Rust five years ago in my spare time. There is so much I love about the community and the ecosystem: The language is both nice to read and write, very expressive, and the community has documented extensively how to design good, idiomatic solutions. There are a lot of powerful crates that just feel natural. For example, thiserror and anyhow/eyre are just so fundamental to defining or handling errors …",

          "description": "Dear fellow Rustaceans,\n Arguably the most challenging part of being a programmer is internalizing a lot of details, sometimes implicit, about the codebase you're working with. It takes significant time, even for an experienced developer, to become fully autonomous on a new project.\n I've always wanted to find a way to ease this process of memorizing the codebase, and I have also been fascinated with large language models since first learning about them. As you already guessed, my pet project is a thing that utilizes the LLMs' language understanding to answer questions about the repo you are in. As seen on the screenshot, it first scans through the code with Tree Sitter to map out the interrelations among the symbols, after that it reads through the selected source files to understand them, and then it presents its conclusion to the user.\n The key point here is that by staying in the command-line interface you do not break context. You do not have to copy-paste anything anywhere, and the conversation just flows.\n Other good questions it may help you with:\n  \nDuring what period of time were we using a vulnerable version of a certain crate?\n Who are the top three committers?\n Is there a user-wide config?\n  \nI very much hope someone might find this helpful as well. Any feedback is welcome, both on the code, and on the looks and feels of it:\n https://github.com/xhjkl/well\n $ cargo install well\n screenshot of well in action\n    submitted by    /u/makarmakar  \n [link]   [comments]",

After all, no race condition can happen.\n \nWhy Rust force me to use \"unsafe\" to touch this \"static mut\" ?\n \n The reason is aliasing : if you use \"static mut\" in a way that end up with more than 1 exclusive reference, this is undefined behavior.\n The compiler assume only 1 exclusive reference to a memory location can exist at any point in time. \"static mut\" give you the power to get as many exclusive reference you want (by using \"unsafe\").\n Even if you think you can manage this, this can be very surprising and result in ugly code.\n 1st, you'll have to use \"unsafe\" at any time you touch the \"static mut\".\n 2nd, if you store an exclusive reference of the \"static mut\" on the stack (temporary or function argument), you can't have another one unless the first one lifetime end.\n 3rd, you'll have to shorten the lifetime yourself by using block {} or function call.\n 4th, even using a shared reference forbid you to have an exclusive reference somewhere.\n It's very easy to forgot you have already one reference of the \"static mut\" in-use inside your call-stack (upper), and the compiler doesn't say anything because all access of the \"static mut\" are gate behind \"unsafe\". The same problem happen in multi-thread with Mutex : if you have one lock in your call-stack, and you try to lock the same Mutex again, it's probably a deadlock. One could consider it's a programmer error and you should respect the invariant, I don't know what to say about that.\n What are your favorite alternative ? OnceCell, OnceLock. UnsafeCell, SyncUnsafeCell, RefCell, Arc<Mutex>, Rc<RefCell>, std::ptr::addr_of_mut! ?\n    submitted by    /u/Nzkx  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would love to get feedback, criticism and even just straight up roasting, every kind of feedback is welcome. \n I've added a preview of how it looks like right now.

This app would need some SQL stuff, not too much desktop integration.\n The main reason to no develop a simple web It's avoid using servers.\n Right now I'm good with typescript and react. Also python but I think it won't be useful for that.\n I don't know rust, but I don't mind to learn.\n \n My first thought was about electron, some apps I use are made with electron, it's widely used and fits my language knowledge, but, maybe it's a bit bloat, some of the apps I use are slow even for \"simple\" purposes. Also bundle size could be close to 200M for a simple text editor. Apps like VSCode are very optimized despite that, but I'm not Microsoft,\n So I saw Tauri, It looks great, even made my first \"hello world\" app in twenty minutes, but I cannot find serious projects using this technology. Most of the stuff I found are simple hobby projects abandoned a couple of years ago.

After finishing rustaceans I decided to try implementing a binary tree.\n I struggled a lot trying to get the borrows right, and compiler screamed a lot at me especially when I tried to hold multiple mutable references (forgot they are exclusive). I managed to get it compiled but I'm not satisfied with the insert method as it looks kinda ugly and probably more complex than it should be, and I believe it's unidiomatic. I think a lot of that came from trying not to drop or move a Box, hence the `ref mut`s. Could you mind giving me some guidance? What can i do to make this more idiomatic?\n #[derive(Debug)] pub struct Node<T> { pub value: T, pub left: Option<Box<Node<T>>>, pub right: Option<Box<Node<T>>>, } impl<T> Node<T> { fn new(value: T) -> Self { Node{value: value, left: None, right: None} } } #[derive(Debug)] pub struct BinaryTree<T> where T: PartialOrd { pub root: Option<Box<Node<T>>> } impl<T: PartialOrd> BinaryTree<T> { fn new() -> Self { BinaryTree { root: Option::None } } fn is_empty(&self) -> bool { return self.root.is_none(); } fn insert(&mut self, value: T) { if let Some(ref mut node) = self.root { let mut node = node.as_mut(); loop { if value < node.value { if let Some(ref mut child) = node.left { node = child.as_mut(); } else { let new_node = Box::new(Node::new(value)); node.left = Some(new_node); break; } } else if value > node.value { if let Some(ref mut child) = node.right { node = child.as_mut(); } else { let new_node = Box::new(Node::new(value)); node.right = Some(new_node); break; } } else { break; } } } else { let new_node = Box::new(Node::new(value)); self.root = Some(new_node); } } } fn main() { let mut my_tree = BinaryTree::<i32>::new(); my_tree.insert(5); my_tree.insert(7); my_tree.insert(3); my_tree.insert(10); println!(\"{:?}\", my_tree); } \n    submitted by    /u/etzellux  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Link to the crate\n I created this tool after having tried to bisect some rustc bugs a while ago, and discovering that there wasn't an easy way to limit the amount of memory a program can use in a multi-platform way (I'm working on Windows at home). There are a bunch of methods to do that on Linux, but I feel like they're a bit contrived and part of a greater ecosystem of limits that may not really be easy to use in the context of cargo-bisect-rustc.\n With this program, you can specify the maximum amount of memory a command can use before it gets killed (of course, if it doesn't go over that limit, then everything goes normally). If needed, you can follow children too and assert that the sum of all memory consumed by all of them doesn't go over the limit. You can also switch between RSS memory and virtual memory, if needed. So, for example:\n $ memlimit 16GiB -c cargo install ripgrep --force \n This will:\n  \nset a limit of 16GiB (gibibytes, 16 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 bytes)\n with -c, follow all children spawned by the initial program and sum up their memory usage\n monitor the command cargo install ripgrep --force\n  \nI know this isn't a really impressive or important tool, but I felt there wasn't an easy-to-use multiplatform tool to do this. It's very small and doesn't have a lot of features, so I'm super open to criticism and suggestions!\n    submitted by    /u/FennecAuNaturel  \n [link]   [comments]",

This release contains several new features and improves existing features. Diesel now provides a procedural macro attribute that infers the correct return type for your query. It's now possible to instrument connection implementations provided by diesel to perform logging and performance measurements. We added support for PostgreSQL's COPY FROM and COPY TO syntax which can be used to send and receive large amounts of data efficiently. Our dependencies wrapping the native database drivers support now all building the database driver as part of your cargo build. This enables us to distribute static precompiled versions of diesel-cli easily. Finally we worked with the Rust team to stabilize attributes to customize error messages emitted by the compiler. This is now used by diesel to improve the quality of certain otherwise hard to understand error messages. \n This release wouldn't be possible without the support of our contributors and sponsors. If you want to support diesels development, consider joining the reviewer team, submitting PR's, help writing documentation or sponsor the maintainers.\n I'm happy to answer any questions about this release or diesel in general.\n    submitted by    /u/weiznich  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone, a few days ago I watched a video called writing your own daemon in C which lead me to try to write one on my own in Rust. I am by no means a Rustacean, nor an expert. Just an average programmer curious about writing a service in Rust. \n I call the Daemon birth-hound. It is as the name suggests a daemon which notifies you if it's anyone's birthday (it can be used for notifying you about other important dates as well!). It keeps track of a CSV file which includes the birth date and the person's name. Naturally the daemon checks for all the dates and then notifies using libnotify crate. \n Here are my questions :\n  \nIs this too simple of an idea to be written as a daemon, as daemon's do consume cpu and ram resources\n \nIs there another approach to do this? I discovered that systemd uses .timer which is used for scheduling programs, so instead of writing a long running process which actually excutes instructions once in a day, you could write a .timer file and in it tell it to execute the rust file to do the checking at 11:59pm everyday\n \nDo you think it is a good idea to write it in a cli style app wherein the user can do a birth-hound start or birth-hound stop to start and stop the daemon to their wish\n \nI would access the CSV file using File IO obviously, but should I asc users to create their own CSV file and ask them to manually enter it's path into the src code or should I provide them with a CSV myself, if it's the latter, how should I go about it?\n \n That's all the questions I have for now. Feel free to ask me more questions if you have any.\n Any sort of advise or guidance would be of great help!!! Thank you in advance and apologies if this seems to be noob questions I literally downloaded Rust two days ago and am trying to read the docs and figure my way out\n    submitted by    /u/cybermethhead  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is because I am still ramping up and getting familiar with the common practices people use the minimize the pain of working through such a thorough compiler.\n I'm not so interested in learning tricks that folks learned while hacking on a personal project (no offense, it's just that I'm already doing this and learning on my own), though such tips and tricks are welcome. But I would LOVE to hear some stuff like the tips found in Effective Rust, that people have picked up from going through the whole development process in a professional setting. \n Can anyone share? Input greatly appreciated. Cheers. \n    submitted by    /u/bbrd83  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The main issue with Rust is that it's not fast to iterate - when it compiles it runs, but your logic may be wrong, and then you may need to change your stuff and make it correct again. However, the performance is over the roof and it's memory safe - performance and memory-safety are two hard to combine features\n Clojure is in a completely different place: it's BLAZINGLY fast to iterate, but - and now, this is probably because I'm a total newb in Clojure - it's pretty weird to try to squeeze super performance out of it. It's performant alright, but it's no Rust/C++, and can probably never be, since it's garbage-collected and has some decently costed abstractions\n So I think where I want to be is to have good mastery of both languages: using Rust for anything that needs to have high-performance or for low level stuff, and Clojure as the day-to-day tool to jack-in and hack away\n Now, I don't have enough knowledge of language design to understand how viable it would be, but it'd be pretty neat to have Clojure doing interop with Rust - you jack-in into a Rust program, invoke and break Rust functions in the REPL, iterate adding stuff; when you're done you compile the experiments into Rust code and make it Rust-compilable.

          "description": "Hollo, Rustacians! \n I'm a backend developer, and I mainly use Go. I had read the Rust Book multiple times before, as I find it be insightful and interesting. Last week I had some free time, so I decided to work on my first actual project in Rust. It was a simple HTTP server. \n Overall, it was a fun experience. The type system is powerful. I felt at home with defining types and attaching methods to them. Enums are great as well. The Option type for gracefully handling null values and the Result type for more flexible error handling. It was satisfying to refactor my code to remove cloning or to use ? for early returns.\n Although, I found the compiler to be too much in the way. At some points, my speed grinded to a halt, trying to understand what I did wrong and how should I fix it. Granted, I'm new, and it's only natural to face such problems. But in many cases, I had to alter the solution I had in my mind to match what the compiler expected of me, which required so much mental energy. It was challenging in a fun way, but my productivity plummeted.\n Now that I'm fairly done with the project, it feels like I'm missing something about Rust. Surely, I'll continue to use it for my side projects, but I don't get the hype around it. What makes it so great? Is it just the challenge of writing more idiomatic code and constant refactoring, or is there something that Rust does that I'm not appreciating?\n    submitted by    /u/hossein1376  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have automated most of the excel but I am unable to find some way to have C# insert the raw files for me, have the software process it and then take the result file (xlsx file) for further processing.\n Here's where I am at a dead end. How would make C# run the software for me?\n    submitted by    /u/No_Influence3030  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's been a blast learning about web API, SignalR for real-time features, and all the fun bits in between.\n What's inside?\n  \nUser authentication & registration with Jwt tokens and user profiles.\n Posting photos with captions and hashtags.\n Liking & commenting on posts.\n Following & unfollowing users.\n Real-time direct messaging with SignalR.\n Notifications for likes, comments, and follows.\n Searching for users, posts, and hashtags.\n Even stories that disappear after a while!\n  \nInitially, I wanted to undertake a project focused on CRUD operations. My first thought was to clone Facebook using a microservices architecture, but that seemed like a massive undertaking for a junior developer.

I couldn't remember things I learned the day before. \n Anyway, I took an easy day and then when I got back to it, its like it started making sense again. Coding feels like magic when I'm learning. I'm creating something. Those little aha! moments as you press the green button and it all works are incredible! \n I kind of shot myself in the foot in the beginning because I was barely practicing. But since I've been ending every lesson with 2-3 mini projects its been going very well. I cant wait to see where all be in a month and going on! \n If you have any tip or advice for a newbie I would greatly appreciate it. My hardest sections are anything involving math.

If i declare type with two int fields - for structs ctor'ed in methods, they are positioned accordingly on stack, or for classes - on heap after VMT pointer (of course there can be some padding or optimisation from CLR, but in general - it is true).\n BE:LE does NOT affects bit order.\n In general BE:LE does NOT affects process' virtual adress space. Oversimplifying, if I run the same programm under ideal conditions on BE and LE computers, the memory snapshot will look the same, except for primitive object fields, but objects positions and their layouts whould be the \"same\".\n BE:LE does affects only primitive types, i.e. Int16-64, double, float, unsigned types, and especially >1byte chars. Bool and byte for example doesn't affected bc of 1byte, also decimal doesn't affected, bc it is composite type.\n  \nI need someone to confirm/disprove my statements, because I'm a bit confused, given that I've always drawn a picture in my head of bytes going from left to right.

This base class had a huge constructor that did a lot of setups on our mocks.\n I went ahead and refactored to use Shared context in xUnit and removed the base class, and that greatly increased the speed of the tests.\n However..\n A lot of these tests used some helper methods defined inside of the previous base class. These helper method was responsible for setting up additional setups on the mocks.\n This led me to some issues when running the tests afterwards, as the unit test that called the helper method added some setups on the mock, that caused other tests to fail.\n All tests run when running one by one, but some fails when all are running.\n I have been thinking about ways of solving this, but got stuck.\n Ideally, it would be great if I can setup a mock to only be valid ONCE.\n Or find a way to reset some specific mocks after every method call, but I haven't found a way of doing this.\n Any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/sponkae  \n [link]   [comments]",

In January, I switched to a CCTV company as a software developer, hoping to learn about backend technologies, computer networking, and software development. Initially, I built 2 or 3 components for their software, but for the past five months, I’ve been assigned tasks unrelated to coding, such as remotely fixing camera issues and manually testing software developed by a senior developer.\n Despite expressing my desire to focus on software development, my manager keeps postponing any coding tasks due to ongoing issues with the company’s software. This has hindered my confidence in coding since I only had three months of coding experience from my previous company. Additionally, when interviewers ask about projects I've worked on at my current company, I struggle because I haven't done any significant coding work here. My target is to get a job as a .NET developer.\n I need advice on what to include in my resume regarding my role in this company, which uses WPF .NET framework, while my skills are in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I joined with the hope of gaining backend knowledge and becoming a full-stack developer, but I haven’t received any coding tasks for the past five months.

At several points throughout the talk the presenters pause to consider whether or not what copilot suggested was intellible, or laugh at how wrong it was. Or worse still, recognise that while the suggested code seemed correct, it wasn't quite right due to a nuance. \n I have nothing against Copilot as a product and think it can serve as a valuable assistant for certain tasks, but please keep it out of all live coding / tutorial type content. As a seasoned .NET developer I can happily \"see through\" the prompts and focus on the actual intent of the presenters but I can imagine how jarring and disorienting it would be to newer developers trying to understand the concepts and follow code while the layout jumps all over the screen in unpredictable ways.\n I'm not sure if this is something that Microsoft is mandating that all of their presenters enable but it's really detracting from their otherwise fantastic content.\n    submitted by    /u/nom_de_kek  \n [link]   [comments]",

It was quite nice to work with, and I always had an idea to build something similar but for SQL (the system was actually using custom query language called FetchXML). Here is the reference to their concept - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.query.queryexpression?view=dataverse-sdk-latest\n So finally after some spare nights I've built this tiny library SQLQueryExpression NET - https://github.com/skinex/SqlQueryExpression.NET At the moment, this library is quite basic, it could handle SELECTS, WHERE conditions (nested conditions as well) JOINS (LEFT and INNER) as well as UNION and EXCEPT ALL. I do have a plans to add support for queries listed in Not Supported Queries section at some point.\n If you find this library or perhaps this approach interesting, feel free to give it a try, report any issues or contribute to the current codebase :)\n PS: I'm aware that this library is not nearly as powerful as EF Core (or even EF), or SQLKata, it's just demonstrates a way of writing queries in object oriented manner. I'm also don't really want to debate about functional vs object oriented way of building queries, I'm pretty sure everyone has very strong opinions on this matter, but it wasn't a point of this tool to prove anything regarding this topic.\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/namethinker  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've never done C# and I was mainly front end with JavaScript for some enterprise applications for the first year and a half. I wanted to do back end development since I was more proficient with front end and have never explored back end development at the job at all.\n This past March, I made an appointment to see both the manager and tech lead and asked if they have back end projects where I can learn and contribute to the team. They were delighted to set me up with a Microsoft & Pluralsight training program and follow through the lessons. Fast forward, I was recently assigned with a project using Entity Framework to create some repositories and boy I have never been stumped on an assignment, ever. My Imposter syndrome was creeping up at times and I felt defeated not knowing what to do.\n The team and tech lead who has way more experience in Entity Framework were very helpful every time I ran to a problem. I asked what I could do outside of work to improve my C# skills and they suggested Pluralsight foundations and Microsoft's C# documentation, which are helpful. I bought C# Player's guide a while back that I'm currently working through after work and it seems very helpful.\n It was the best decision of my (career) life because I felt that I was not progressing as a software engineer and was doing simple front end assignments. Backend is a whole different world. I'm currently getting my behind kicked doing Entity Framework but I'm learning so much about C#, the framework, and what I need to work on. If anyone else felt like they are not progressing, ask you manager to see what you could do that is more challenging or an area where you don't have expertise in and learn.\n    submitted by    /u/foureyeddriver  \n [link]   [comments]",

Define the classes in both the API and the ClientLib\n Duplicate code (not per se a bad thing), but there is more room for error. Fixing a bug in the API DTO and forgetting to change the library or something like that.\n 2. Define the classes in the ClientLib, and let the API include the ClientLib\n This would remove the duplicity, but feels wrong. The client should not be the owner of the DTO's, but the API. \n 3. Define the classes in the API and include the API in the ClientLib\n Would make the whole ClientLib bloated with code it doesn't need.\n 4. Create a seperate Library with the DTO's, which get included in both the API and the ClientLib\n Feels like a lot of extra complexity for such a small problem.\n Currently we've gone with Number 1. Sure some duplicate code, but it's a total seperation of concerns. And each DTO can have some utility functions specifically for the API or Client.\n I guess I'm not the only one working with API and Clients this way, so really interested in how others solve this \"problem\". \n    submitted by    /u/MrCorba  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello reddit, I’ve built a global serverless API gateway which handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, monitoring transformations etc.\n It’s entirely built on top of C# and .NET8 and uses the Microsoft Reverse Proxy (https://github.com/microsoft/reverse-proxy) at it’s core, for proxying the requests. It’s also inspired by the .NET architecture, with the notion of routes and middlewares and comes with a nice interface to configure everything in minutes (no code required).\n There are three main concepts:\n  \nRoutes - paths that define different operations in your API (can be with dynamic, optional or catch-all parameters). It uses the .NET route matching for processing requests.\n Backends - a cluster of endpoints where the requests will be proxied to\n Middlewares - functions that are executed in a specific order in Routify edge proxies and define how requests are processed. These are similar as the .NET middlewares and policies approach. You can have global middlewares in app level that apply to all routes or you can have route specific middlewares. You can also disable a specific app middleware or you can disable all app middlewares in a specific route.\n  \nSo far, it has processed 100+ million requests and works very fast (.NET8 is amazing). The average processing time for route matching and middleware processing is ~1ms (this does not include the network operations when proxying the requests).\n Routify makes it easier to manage and secure public APIs. It's distributed across many regions globally and acts as a proxy between your clients and your services.\n You can use it as a reverse proxy, as a gateway between your APIs in different cloud providers, as a geo load balancer or simply as a monitoring tool for all requests going through your API.\n For those interested, Routify is in public beta and freee to use at https://routify.to\n Check it out and let me know if you have any feedback or question. I’m happy to answer them.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/RoutifyTo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have used Entity Framework for some project in the past, both with .net framework and .net core, in database first and code first version. \n Coming to the conclusion that it is more disadvantages than advantages, while it makes my life easier on the other hand it introduces other problems , e.g. hard to write queries, read in linq. Excessive uncontrolled reads on the db and various headaches caused by unexpected engine behavior.\n After shelving Ef for years in favor of dapper (I got along very well with Dapper there is I used it for many projects), I continued to use entity only to generate filtered queries automatically . \n Now I have to start a new very complex project and am writing the framework to be reused for various sub projects. I am adopting Ef code first, convinced by colleagues, however I keep thinking it will be a source of problems more than a real advantage and various limitations and difficulties are emerging already in the first tests where we are forced to use raw sql for partial updates in the la unit of work. \n So I would like to use dapper and/or sugarsql on all queries at least at the framework level.\n Also considering that what I used to write with ef 7 years ago is pretty much to trash and what I wrote with dapper is fully functional , I think that ef in the long run its not the right choice.\n What is your experience with ef/dapper/sugar sql?

But I haven’t exactly done a Windows program before, at least in terms of an executable program that can be run in portable format, and possibly even installed (in some future version) for scheduled monitoring.\n In general, when dealing with Windows internals for purely Win10 and Win11, would you preferentially reach for a DotNet Framework or a DotNet Core setup?\n Looking for reasoning. My background is mainly in Enterprise-level CRUD Intranet apps for companies, which would run locally on their network from a server. So it’s not like I have oodles of experience creating programs for the desktop. I know Framework is on it’s way out, but I have also heard that it still has superior third-party resources for Windows-specific capabilities and needs.\n The vast majority of the app’s functionality will be in modifying the registry in a safe/programmatic way, and running specific PowerShell commands. Depending on requirements, some may be isolated as vertical slice components, others may have a shared “applying engine” against which instructions can be run. This will be protected behind a very simple checkbox-based or slider-button-based UI.\n Final note: this will NOT be released through the Windows Store, as I highly doubt it would ever get approved there. Straight download only. I also intend this to have a more traditional Windows-like UI, and a standard *.exe binary with no external files except for text-based “sanity/changes-implemented references” that are filename-locked to whatever system they were generated against, in case the executable ends up on a USB stick or network share to be applied to multiple systems.\n    submitted by    /u/rekabis  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So my app is semi-finished, it already does what it has to, when I have more time I'll improve the GUI or some other stuff about it.\n The problem is that I've noticed during my completely amateur testing that there's times it takes it 5 seconds to change the BitLocker PIN and export the key, sometimes only 2. Usually only 2 seconds but even that isn't fast enough for me. \n When I had this app completely in powershell, I accepted it being due to the fact it was in powershell. Interpreted is going to be slow compared to compiled\n But this one is entirely WMI-based, no powershell, no cmdline arguements, just C# using WMI calls. And it's compiled. \n So I'm looking for ways to make my app faster. Ideally it'd take it 1 second - no more - to delete the current TPMAndPin protector, delete the current Numerical Password, change the TpmAndPin protector to the user's input and then export the auto-generated Numerical Password to the given location\n As I said, sometimes this takes 2 seconds, sometimes 4-5. Ideal time would be 1 second.\n I'd go for asynchronous but in this case these things have to happen in this specific order. If the TpmAndPin isn't deleted before a new one is created, the new one won't be created because the system cannot contain more than 1 TpmAndPin protector.\n Can I get some help with this?

(github.com)\n How it Works ?\n Terminator defines a method called UnProtectAndTerminate that aims to terminate a specified process after removing its protection. It utilizes platform invoke to call functions from system DLLs. First, it imports functions from ntdll.dll and kernel32.dll. These functions are NtSetInformationProcess to alter process information and TerminateProcess to forcibly terminate a process. Within the UnProtectAndTerminate method, it enters debug mode using Process.EnterDebugMode(). Then it attempts to open the target process using OpenProcess, passing necessary parameters including the process ID. Afterward, it calls NtSetInformationProcess with appropriate arguments to remove the process protection. If successful, it terminates the process using TerminateProcess with an exit code of 0. \n Why was this tool made ?\n I developed this tool specifically designed to terminate processes containing the RtlSetProcessIsCritical feature, after encountering several malware samples utilizing this technique during my analysis.\n    submitted by    /u/Temporary_Hope_7198  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A friend is learning ASP.NET and needed a clarification from the book \"ASP.NET Core in action\" by Andrew Lock. At page 211, the author recommends not to resolve scoped or transient services directly from the root DI container, because can lead to \"leaking of memory\".\n  \nWARNING Don’t resolve scoped or transient services directly from WebApplication.Services.\n This approach can lead to leaking of memory, as the objects are kept alive till the app exits and aren’t garbage-collected.\n  \nBut for scoped services, you cannot resolve a scoped service without having a scope, you need to create a scope first! And even if you forget to dispose the scope, it will eventually go garbage collected and disposed. How can a memory leak be produced?\n For transient services, you cannot have a memory leak, because that's how transient services work, an instance is created every time, the container does not keep an instance to it.\n Next, another recommendation which is confusing:\n  \nInstead, you should only resolve scoped and transient services from an active scope.\n  \nAlways resolve transient services from an active scope!? What does scope have to do with transient services?\n Although I am senior engineer myself, I wanted to ask a clarification further, here that's why I posted it here.\n DISCLAIMER: My goal here is not to try call out the book or the author in any way!!! To be clear, I have not read the book, but the book seems very nice, it has very nice and useful diagrams, it's just that this specific part is weird, at least to me.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Natural_Tea484  \n [link]   [comments]",

Something I did so far was defining an update model and everything that is not null will be updated to a value. This only works for data that can't explicitly be set to null.

          "description": "Hi,\n Been learning programming with Python for this past year, year and a half, and find myself completely hooked!\n My IT manager has been talking about wanting me to work more with the Dev team, but presses on me to start learning C#.\n I did some work with it earlier with Unity, and also some basic testing by setting up some APIs, but really the more I work with C#, I want to go back to Python.\n Can't really put my finger on it due to my inexperience, but there's something about the logic of Python, the dev space and everything that speaks to me.\n With C# on the other hand, I feel like it relies more on using robust frameworks that have been iterated on again and again, as opposed to creating what you need from the bottom-up.\n I also see myself more drawn towards scripting. How can I enhance my SQL? How can I use this to handle the moving of x different files based on these rules and so on. I want to solve problems quickly, and with little hassle. I don't want to spend four weeks just getting an API running before I can start properly testing and improving it.\n Am I wrong in thinking that Python is for me and C# is not, or is this just me forming an opinion when I simply don't know enough about C# development?\n    submitted by    /u/Severin_Suveren  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n I've recently put significant effort into enhancing my library for generating fluent builders and I believe it has now matured enough to be applied to most use cases. Fluent builders are very convenient but writing them can be tedious. The idea of this library is to generate the builder class from attributes on the properties and methods of the class to be built. The latest updates include\n  \nSupport for generics and partial classes\n Enabling of optional builder methods\n Branching capabilities\n Support for returning arbitrary types\n  \nIf you're new to this library, you may find the storybook helpful. It explains the library step by step and provides a comprehensive overview of its features. You can find a link to the storybook, as well as additional examples, in the readme on GitHub.\n To illustrate the usefulness of the library, you can have a look at the diagrams in this excellent blog post by Mitesh. The fluent API described in the post can be crafted in about 5 minutes using the library. An implementation can be found in the comments of the blog post, as well as in the example project included with the library.\n Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions. If you would like to get some input on how to use the library in your use case, please create a GitHub issue with the label `design help request` and you will receive timely feedback.\n Happy Coding!,\n Kevin\n    submitted by    /u/kmschaal2  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a very potato laptop but i can surf web and run basic softwares. \n I wanted to make a pixel art game for a long time. I got the inspirations from Stardew Valley, Thimbleweed Park, Undertale, Celest, Iconoclast. I have Aseprite for pixel art sprites and google a little bit for coding for a game and decided C Sharp is good enough for making simple games. I want my game to run good under potato specs so you can play it any device anywhere.\n I have ideas for a simple bracelet game to make. I have ideas for RPG game. I also have probably an hour or three a day to spend on this hobby project. That includes learning c sharp, learning pixel art/drawing (I also dont know that) and making the game. I also picked godot engine for the game development. It is free and open source and that's all i want.\n I dont know if i am aiming to high or if this is achievable at all. I am planning for a deadline at all. if it takes 10 years so be it. As long as i am satisfied with every bit of the game and art i am okay with it. I am making a post beacause i need advice or suggesttion for my goals. I dont want to learn or do wrong things and reliase later that all of that was for nothing.\n For learning i have bought a cource or udemy (it was cheap) and for pixel art i have anothe cource (I got for free) if you have any other resource or forum or subreddit for beginner c sharp programming and pixel art games that would be helpfull as well.\n    submitted by    /u/jerry_hpkns  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm returning to C# after around 7 years of not working with it, and seeing that we now have stricter nullability checks makes me very happy. However, I'm having trouble using them when fields are initialized in a method called by a framework or a game engine, such as Godot or Unity. Example:\n #nullable enable // Example 1 - I will set _graphics in the Godot editor UI, // and I want the game to crash if I don't. [Export] private Sprite2D? _graphics; private Sprite2D? _someOtherSprite; private Set<Node2D>? _setOfThings; public override void _Ready() { // Example 2 - _Ready is guaranteed to be called once, // before any other method from this class is called. _someOtherSprite = GetNode<Sprite2D>(\"SomeNode\"); } public void MyMethod() { // I want both these fields to be considered non-null here. _graphics.Scale = _someOtherSprite.Scale; _graphics.DoSomething(); // I still want strict null checks for everything else. if (_setOfThings != null) _setOfThings.Add(_graphics); } \n Ideally I'd like a field or property to be excluded from nullability checking if it is initialized in _Ready, or if _Ready has an assertion like ThrowIfNull(_graphics) for that field.\n Is this currently possible in C#, given that these variables are not initialized in the constructor? If not, what are some workarounds I can use to exclude some fields from nullability checking?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/smthamazing  \n [link]   [comments]",

I landed a really good job after leaving but was made redundant and now basically 8 months later I can't land a job.\n I feel I'm in an awkward spot, as I technically have 4 years experience but my coding skill does not reflect that. Also really struggle with working from home with productivity and low moods - really need an office based job.\n Just looking for some advice on how to proceed. Do I aim for the scarce junior jobs or go for lower end mid level? Confidence is low and have major imposter syndrome. \n What would you recommend coding in my spare time/what technology should I focus on? Is there a good website with challenges to do? I just feel so lost and really don't want to give up a career in tech and work in retail. Also doesn't help that the indurstry has basically crashed right now.\n Sorry for the rant, appreciate any advice.\n    submitted by    /u/ExecuteScalar  \n [link]   [comments]",

So for example if I put, say, some powershell in my C# app, and it works, and the rest of the app is all C#, how does that potentially make my app less secure than if it only relied on native API calls?\n Thanks a bunch\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Exchange_9646  \n [link]   [comments]",

Both attempts to receive UDP packets from an external device.\n Here's code (cannot be simpler)\n ``` using System; using System.Net; using System.Net.Sockets; using System.Text;\n class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { int listenPort = 4005; string broadcaster = \"192.168.0.88\";\n  using (UdpClient listener = new UdpClient(listenPort)) { IPEndPoint groupEP = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(broadcaster), listenPort); try { Console.WriteLine($\"Listening for UDP broadcasts from {broadcaster} on port {listenPort}\"); while (true) { byte[] bytes = listener.Receive(ref groupEP); string receivedData = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytes, 0, bytes.Length); Console.WriteLine($\"Received broadcast from {groupEP} : {receivedData}\"); } } catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine(e.ToString()); } } } \n } ```\n When I debug in dotnet6 it all works as intended. In .NET framework it simply waits for messages and nothing happens. It's the same if I run it in 'release', even from executable. I was running the code on Windows 10 x64 machine.\n But actually the code is intended to run on Windows7 Embedded (x86) device. What's irritating, any of the codes (not dotnet6 nor .net framework) works on that...\n Do you happen to have any ideas what may be the reason of such weird behavior?

I'm not sure how to tackle the problem of authenticating my users to both clients. A user can login using same account on both apps.\n I have some requirements that have to be met and some problems:\n  \nI don't to use an external identity provider like Auth0 or Firebase. I want to store user credentials in my own database. I have no problem with writing some password-hashing code myself.\n Native login: I don't want to open a browser window in my mobile app or redirect to another page in SPA, so I don't use OAuth\n Use cookies for the web app and Header-Authorization for the mobile app? It is considered insecure using localStorage for authentication tokens in SPAs\n Session management: I tend to use Server-Side-Sessions that are stored in the database. Users in the mobile app stay logged in infinitely, users in the web app should be logged out after 30 days of inactivity.\n How to pass the session ID to the mobile app if we can't use cookies the same way as in the Web app? Should we transmit it in the body JSON? Should the API check for a authentication token in both locations (Cookie and Header)\n Session rotation: When someone signs in, the server-side session token is generated and stored in the database, until it expires or the user logs out. Do I need some kind of rotation for this token?\n  \nWhat would you recommend? Do you have any examples for this use case or any libraries that I might use?\n Thanks a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/Loris156  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I built an app from scratch using C# for the most part and 2-3% powershell. The app first connects to a server, fetches all the available network shares, and tries to map them persistently. Depending on how many accesses the user has, some of them will not be mapped, or all of them. Etc. Also all these actions are logged into a txt file found in the native folder of the app.\n So I've been testing the app and including all the logging, the app took 13s to persistently map 16 shares. \n I've also tried relying on native Windows APIs instead to make it faster but that just made it slower lol\n A few notes:\n I do NOT want async mapping as that would break the real-time progress text ((share name) mapped succesfully!). \n Async logging also seems to break the app. \n There's a function to pre-connect to the file server so if you use domain name instead of IP, the app won't be slowed down which would normally occur in the event of using domain name instead of IP\n I'm running out of ideas.\n Mind you, I have my IDE on a VM not on my host PC for a couple of reasons. 1) snapshots are super helpful and ofc I always back up working code into an encrypted location on my NAS; 2) I don't want to clutter my physical PC with dev stuff tbh. VMs just seem cleaner in this regard but that might be me\n Can someone supply me with good ideas as to what I should try to improve the speed of the app?\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Exchange_9646  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is my 1st job and throughout my tenure so far, my team and I are using a low-code software that allows us to finish web-based projects for production in less than a month.\n Last month I was told I will be moved to a new branch of IT. Because of this, I was told to study ASP.NET MVC. I will be mentored by a foreign senior IT. However, the mentoring was not as sophisticated as I imagined. They gave me no online courses, there are no curriculums, and they told me to just Google any technical-related stuff. I asked where will I learn jQuery and my mentor just gave me the link to the jQuery website. So, my learning was not structured. I hop from one article to another to learn ASP.NET MVC and watch different teachers in YouTube, and via reading the system code written in ASP MVC. It was not a fun experience, but in the end I achieved their expectations. Because of this, they made me the leader. \n Now for my scenario, since I know ASP.NET, they now tasked me to create a curriculum for new IT's that will be working/learning from me. I imagined my IT Head/Manager is better suited for this task because he likely knows a lot of programming in general or what the business needs, but he pushed this task on me for reasons I don't know. Since my learning was unmodulated and unstructured, and I know for a fact that the way they made me learn C# ASP.NET MVC was not for everyone, I'm utterly clueless on what online course will be effective in gearing new IT's for application development in C# be it ASP.NET or desktop application. The company is paying whatever it may be so there's that. All I know is this... whatever course it may be, it must have a certificate at the end, so the new IT's can put it in their personal website or resume for their future jobs, unlike me.\n I'm utterly clueless. Can anyone suggest? Thank you...\n    submitted by    /u/JoeNaks  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I have some lines like this in my code. This is part of a process which creates rows in a DB based on an input Excel file and other info from the DB. My boss wants the calculation of these final fields to be very flexible so formulas for some of them are stored on the DB as C# scripts.\n //Set up the formula execution string formula = config.Formula; var options = ScriptOptions.Default.AddReferences(typeof(ConsolidatedTBRow).Assembly); var globals = new ScriptGlobals { row = tbRow }; //Execute the formula value = CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync<object?>(formula, options, globals: globals).Result.ToString(); \n The problem is that when using a real input file, this code runs 4 times for each of the 38k rows in the input file. And, apparently, each time you run Evaluate on a CSharpScript it creates a process that then is not disposed of. This is causing memory to balloon a crazy amount until I get an out of memory error.\n I've seen a lot of other people mention this issue online but can't find any solutions. I found one fairly complicated one here but this doesn't seem to allow passing parameters to the script (my row variable) which I need to be able to do.\n EDIT: I ended up using DynamicExpresso instead of Roslyn. Not only did it solve my issue, it's also easier to use and my program runs insanely faster. Like, it used to take over an hour to run, and it just finished in about 10 minutes. I can't believe this library didn't come up when I was searching for how to run dynamic scripts in C#\n    submitted by    /u/ShadowShine57  \n [link]   [comments]",

I kinda stumbled on this accidentally, but I do see that a BindingList of type Part (an abstract class I made for my program) can take classes derived from Part. \n Example: I have two derived classes- SmallPart and BigPart. They are both the same but SmallPart has weight and BigPart has serial number. Despite having a field not in common, I’m able to collect both of those instances. See: they both inherit Part but are not actually Part objects…? \n What really got me thinking is I use the BindingList in my data grid view- only the fields that are in common I.e. the Part fields are displayed. \n Obviously I can see it’s only displaying the Part class fields and not the derived characteristics, but I am curious for more details and rules here.

I assume the underlying error is that I'm opening the workbook wrong or something.\n However, it seems like whenever an exception is thrown while doing anything with HttpPostedFileBase.InputStream, the debugger doesn't trigger any breakpoints/catch any exceptions and the endpoint returns a 500 error:\n [NotSupportedException: Collection is read-only.] \n I assume what's happening is it's trying to output something exception-related and so tries to write to the input stream and everything goes to hell. So how can I modify this so that I can see the true exception that's happening? I've tried searching for this but all of the results are simply about people explicitly attempting to write to the input stream, which I'm not, I'd just like a clear exception message.\n I'd appreciate any help anyone can give.\n    submitted by    /u/Zarick13  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basic logic works like this: each savable item returns its own specific type of SaveState object, which is then serialized into Json. So Foo returns FooSaveState and Bar returns BarSaveState.\n It all worked pretty nicely until I reached the point where I need to save a state machine that is set up like this: there's an abstract Behavior class from which each specific state derives. The program has a List<Behavior> myBehaviors and during each update loop it calls myBehaviors[activeBehavior].Execute(). Each derived Behavior has its own set of internal data that I can't generalize out in a global BehaviorSaveState class because otherwise it would be a huge mess and a bit of a waste of space.\n Since I figured I'd save only the active state, I thought I'd solve the issue by writing in Behavior an abstract Save() method that returns a generic System.Object, then each derived behaviors overrides it with its own, specific SaveState class.\n Saving works well and the data written in the file is correct, but loading breaks, because I discovered that the deserialization, rather than a System.Object object, gives me a JsonElement object which I can't seem to be able to deserialize further, nor cast into the correct SaveState class.\n Help, please?

I'm just a joe public and have no idea where to find something like this. I'd be happy to pay a consult fee.\n    submitted by    /u/Soggy-Age4472  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We moved to .NET 7 a while back, took forever because of management and late support in Azure Service fabric. Anyway.. This opened up for required keyword which makes EF Core play nicer with nullable reference types.\n My suggested way foward is this. For all columns that are non null in sql map that to a none nullable reference type in the Entity and use required keyword so that object inilizers can be used. When inserting new entities this means either supply the child entity or if you only have the Id fool the compiler by using null!\n db.AddAsync(new Entity { NavPropId = 1, NavProp = null! }); \n Personaly I think this is pretty ok, and on the query side we always Project. For collections we do\n public required ICollection<T> NavProps { get; set; } = new List<T>(); \n This way we can avoid nullable type which requires you work around it in queries and projections using ! like\n .Select(x => x.MyNoneNullableCollection!.Select(y => ...)); \n Only real downside is that it allocates. But since we project its minimal allocation.\n What do you guys think, is it a good practice, any feedback or ideas are gladly taken. Thanks\n Update: There is nothing gained by doing { get; set; } = new List<T>(). Only risk for mistakes, if the developer misses to do a Invlude he will get a empty collection instead of the actual collection.

Make the Model an observable object with observable properties and update Viewmodel properties from the model. Or make some sort of \"GameManager\" state class that can manage the game object and communicate to the Viewmodels. How would you handle this?

It seems like ASP.NET is the older and battle tested framework while Blazor is the new(er) kid on the block. Blazor seems (I might be wrong) easier to learn and has more eye candy/UX type stuff in it.\n I'm cautious about picking it up because it seems like the big thing that I got out of reading this sub is that Microsoft has a habit of releasing a new technology/framework and then abandoning it if it doesn't get enough traction. Is that something that I should be concerned about with using a newer technology like Blazor? Or has Blazor received enough traction that the chances of that happening are low? Or does it not even matter because the skill sets and code are transferable between the two?\n    submitted by    /u/Heli0sX  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have several references to the `okhttp` dependency in various pom.xml files in my repo, all of them specify version 4.12.0 but for some reason, my builds keep downloading the old version (4.9.3). My only guess is that some other library that I'm using also uses okhttp but I can't tell which one. I could be completely wrong about that too.\n I've been digging through POMs and releases on Maven Central, in the okhttp GitHub repo. I've also been fiddling with `jdeps` and `mvn dependency:tree`. I have been tearing my hair out over this one. . . any help is appreciated.\n EDIT: I should also add that my project uses Java 1.8 and I cannot change that unfortunately (because all of the original developers are gone and I do not have the time/resources to upgrade to a newer JDK).\n    submitted by    /u/tech_tuna  \n [link]   [comments]",

I really like his design and am considering adding him as a character to a freeware video game I'm working on, but I want to make sure I'm able to legally do so. The in-game appearance of him would be an original model I create for the game, so I'm also not sure if I would be crediting specifically the Duke project repository as its owner. The game also isn't coded in Java, though I'm not entirely sure if that would affect whether the character can be used or not. Obviously, I would put a notice somewhere in my game that Orcale isn't affiliated with the game in any way.\n    submitted by    /u/infinityJKA  \n [link]   [comments]",

First and foremost, I apologize for any ignorance or nativity throughout this post, I’m still a teenager in college and do appreciate the infinite wealth of knowledge I lack.\n I have written a decent amount of Java years ago (within the scope of Minecraft) so I’m syntactically comfortable and have a decent understand of the more common interworkings of the language, but these days I do most of my work (backend, mainly) with Golang.\n I’m curious, are new systems even being built with Java anymore, like does the language have life outside of necessity of maintaining older software? I understand that much of its edge came from its portability, but now that I can containerize a NodeJS server and deploy it just about anywhere, what is the point?\n This isn’t coming from a perspective of arguing the language is “dead” (as stupid of an expression as that is) rather I genuinely want to be educated by actual Java programmers to what the longevity of the language will look like going forward.\n TLDR: Why build with Java when there are much faster alternatives?\n Have a great day!\n    submitted by    /u/Beamxrtvv  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would like to add React to it, but I don't really know how to configure project to make everything work together and I can't find tutorial on this topic.\n I would like to compile both frontend and backend into war file for deployment. I would also like to make everything work as \"one project\" instead running everything on separate ports (I am not sure if this is good or not?). Like I would not like to run each time Java and Node separately if that is possible.\n Best tutorial I saw was this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5tcZoNyqGI but he is working with Maven and he is using proxy which I am not sure if it can be avoided (or that is best option)? He is also depending on some plugins to deploy React and Maven together which I would like to avoid so I don't depend on someone updating their plugin when new version of Java/React comes out and something changes.\n Maybe this is not hard thing to do, but I have basically zero experience in configuring project in this kind of way.\n Any advice is welcome\n    submitted by    /u/TurbulentMonitor1300  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Seems that the problem with checked exceptions is not about how verbose they are or how bad they scale (propagate) in the project, nor how ugly they make the code look or make it hard to write code. It is that you simply can't enforce someone to handle an error 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐲, despite enforcing dealing with the error at compile time.\n Although the intention is good, as Brian Goetz said once:\n  \nChecked exceptions were a reaction, in part, to the fact that it was too easy to ignore an error return code in C, so the language made it harder to ignore\n  \nyet, static checking can't enforce HOW those are handled. Which makes almost no difference between not handling or handling exceptions but in a bad way. Hence, it is inevitable to see people doing things like \"try {} catch { /* do nothing */ }\". Even if they handle exceptions, we can't expect everyone to handle them equally well. After all, someone just might deliberately want to not handle them at all, the language should not prevent that either.\n Although I like the idea, to me, checked exceptions bring more problems than benefits.\n    submitted by    /u/turik1997  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to share a situation I'm in and get your opinions on it.\n Recently, I had a technical interview that went quite well, and I've been offered a position. However, instead of using Spring Boot, the company uses Java Vert.x. I've been researching Vert.x and set up a demo project to get familiar with the technology. It seems interesting, especially depending on the complementary libraries they use, like ORM Hibernate Reactive, among others.\n My main concern is about switching from Spring, a highly demanded framework with great prospects, to Vert.x. I feel it's a step out of my \"comfort zone,\" not so much technically, but in terms of stability and the future of the technology. With the threat of Loom, Virtual Threads, and other developments, I'm worried whether the ecosystem of libraries around Vert.x is modern and follows industry standards, or if it's more oriented towards \"legacy\" solutions.\n I've been with my current company for about six months, and while I'm not completely happy with the team and tools, the conditions and environment are not ideal. The new offer has a significant salary increase and other social benefits that are very appealing, but Vert.x is the only point where I have doubts.\n Do you think it's worth leaving Spring Boot, even temporarily, and betting on reactive programming with Vert.x? Has anyone here made a similar switch and could share their experience? Should I consider this \"leap of faith\" or keep looking for opportunities that align more with my experience in Spring Boot?\n I appreciate any advice or experiences you can share.\n PD: I'm 24 years old, so I'm young. 2-3 years experience.\n    submitted by    /u/byHelper  \n [link]   [comments]",

As I do some research about it so far, they added one more layer which is Virtual Thread and instead of blocking at the Platform Thread layer, which is consider to be expensive in order to create or perform context switching, now we block at the Virtual Thread layer which is way more cheaper and consume less memory using continuation and yield similar to couroutine in Kotlin. I agree that this approach would provide better performance. However, it doesn't provide some kind of non-blocking or asynchronous feature out of the box at all it still keep blocking but just at the difference layer.\n PS, my intention was just asking for knowledge I might miss understand something.

They would go to top-tier ML conferences and conduct ML interviews and have reading groups but their actual role was nothing ML-related at all. For myself I was working on maintaining DB clusters the whole time - I asked to do ML work but they wouldn't let me (I don't think there was any for me to do). The team I was on did nothing ML-related but had \"AI\" in its name. It felt like a big LARP. Fortunately I eventually moved on to a better place but I'm curious how normal this is.

Just the recent example, but I lost count of similar threads and mindset. A lot of posts on like r/antiwork gives of the same feeling. \n Stuff I commonly see is(and to be clear, its not one person saying/doing all this):\n  \nI don't need to be friends with people at work because I have other friends\n \nNever drink more than 2 beers then you will say stupid things and get fired the next day. \n \nJust go but leave early because... i don't know\n \nWhy would I ever want to hang out with people I don't know\n \nI don't go to events not duiring office hours because not paid(and no company will ever have a party from like 14-18 lol so what a ultra weird take)\n \nPeople are older/not same education as me/different office/something so it's 0 benefit for me even talking to them\n \nmore stuff...\n \n With that said, I do not mean one should sink 25 beers each company event and stay until 0400 and be expected to talk with 50 people each event. But you know, some common sense is just missing. In my experience for example, the people who work in IT or sales are the best drinkers, and this \"only 2 beers\" mentality I literally never seen. and as another post said, its who you know not what you know after a certain level and what you can be remembered as\n yes you can be someone who dont like alcohol or whatever because addiction, that's fine it's not those guys I mean\n Where do you think all of this is coming from?

          "description": "With all of the doom and gloom posts about how bad the market is, I wanted to create a post with a positive experience. \n I was fired from my last dev job on April 5th for sharing information that I wasn't allowed to supposedly. I sent my offer letter to a school friend who I recommended through an internship program when we were discussing wages, and that friend ended up getting a job offer as well. He was upset that his offer was lower than what I was given, so he sent the recruiter a message about it showing the offer I sent him. I was fired a week later for sharing the info and breaking some policy and what not. \n I ended up getting a job at a warehouse for a furniture store in the meantime because I didn't qualify for unemployment. While working there, I spent the next two months sending out applications everyday like everyone else does. In those two months, I had 15 companies respond back to me wanting a phone screening, hackerrank test, or a straight up interview: responses that got my foot in the door. I had some rough interviews at first but continued to learn from each one of them until I recieved a job offer on June 4th. \n For anyone with a similar background, I graduated college with a BS in CS at the end of 2022, and I only have a year and a half experience outside of college. I also have 3 software dev internships throughout college. Though, I've never coded outside of school/work so I don't have a portfolio or personal projects to show. \n Even though it only lasted two months, I still went through the normal worries and anxiety that most of you have felt or are currently going through. Just remember to keep your head up and to not let yourself feel defeated. Your hard work will come to fruition. There's a light at the end of the tunnel.

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm a Dec 2021 grad who was fortunate enough to get 2 offers within weeks of each other. It feels kinda ironic because I couldn't get anything for so long after graduating, but I just stuck to improving myself as an engineer and as a candidate, and I guess it paid off.\n The problem is I already started the job I got first - I really like the team (friendly and strong culture of respecting wlb) and the pay is very decent (~100k), but the stack is fairly niche (think like Laravel/RoR). It's also not a brand name company.\n On the other hand, the second offer is with a well known tech company with a good reputation for wlb, and ~150k TC. The team also seems more high-achieving (a lot of US masters and past top tech experience vs career switchers, not that that actually determines the quality of engineer) so maybe I would be able to learn more and make my resume look better.\n Just based on the math, 50%+ increase in pay seems like a no-brainer, but I feel like I would really be letting my team down by leaving so soon after joining, and because I spent so long unemployed, I guess I kinda built some imposter syndrome where I feel afraid I wouldn't be able to deliver if I switch to the second company. But I also don't want my sense of loyalty to a company result in me missing out on a big opportunity, since if it helped their bottom line, I know the company wouldn't hesitate to cut me.\n I would really appreciate hearing everyone's thoughts and advice.

I've been here for 3 years and admittedly haven't been doing well for most of my time here.\n My manager has been hot and cold with my quarterly reviews - one review he'll say I'm doing better and improving at a great pace, and another he's giving me what is essentially a PIP. I know I should've tried to leave sooner but I was stubborn and genuinely thought I could improve. I find the code base difficult to understand and navigate, but thought that with enough time it would eventually click. I'm not a lazy worker, I put out good work but my manager says I'm not fast enough with it.\n Recently he approached me basically telling me I'm on the verge of losing my job. He's already in touch with HR about it. I'm on some accommodations for health issues so he said they won't let me go right away, but that upper management is \"looking for a small team of high performers\". I have no idea if anybody else is going through the same thing as me. At this rate I don't expect to have my job by next month or so. It feels as though no matter how hard I try, it doesn't make a difference. I'm heartbroken because this whole ordeal left me feeling like maybe I'm just not cut out to be a good engineer/programmer.\n I've been looking for other positions internally for my level, but those are hard to come by, are usually for other countries, and receive literally thousands of applications, so I haven't even been able to get a single interview after at least two months of looking.\n I love working here and ideally I would like to stay. But I already have two \"PIPs\" on my record. So getting an internal position feels impossible. And with the way the industry is right now, I'm afraid of being without a job for a long time to come.\n What are my options? What would you do in my position?

My salary progression so far in my career is:\n job 1: internship - unpaid - 4 months\n job 2: part time - $14/hr - 6 months\n job 3: full time - $55k/year - 1 year (current job)\n All of these jobs are software engineering roles, none of them are larger tech companies/FAANG\n I really want to make a substantial increase in my salary, and am willing to wait a longer amount of time to apply and keep trying to meet this salary since I am comfortable in my current job. My salary goal for my next job is something between $80k-$100k. When I brought this up with my mom, she said that this was probably unreasonable and that I should keep my expectations low, especially considering my pay in the past.

Then I got an email asking to confirm my interest in a position. I said yes, then got an ODT file (like a word doc) with interview question and answers. Nothing too crazy, just regular interview questions (nothing asking for something too personal). I sent the email and got an email for a soft offer of $60/hr as a junior. I'm excited! It even comes with a stipend for a home office.\n After seeing inconsistencies between email signatures and a feeling of this being off, I call their HQ phone number. Yep, it's a scam. No one I've talked to works there.\n I had heard of a scam online where a company would send you a list of things to buy for your home office and send a check for the stipend. Then either the check would never come and you're stuck having bought so much equipment, or the check bounces. Also the fact that they require you to buy through their vendor also adds that they're stealing legitimate dollars.\n I'm not posting this to fearmonger, as I know much like everyone else here who's worked hard for the chance to get a job in software engineering & development they're doing everything to get a chance.

Not every job however requires you to reinvent your core skills every 5-10 yrs (JavaScript to Angular to React for example) nor does every job have intense panel technical interviews that one must practice for consistently. Data analyst positions (what u was before software developers) have to learn things but their core skills of sql and tableau are not going anywhere.

My manager expected me to be done with this work within a couple weeks. Its been 2 months and ive barely made progress. I had a 1:1 with him today and was on the verge of tears.\n Right now I just want to quit and go to another job so bad. I feel so lost and don’t have the slightest idea what im doing. I need some sort of advice as to what I should do to salvage this situation\n Update for those interested: I had a meeting with my manager and essentially told him everything I felt and what I needed for success.

I have an undergrad in finance and law from a target, but have taught myself python to the point where I have automated the most tedious aspects of the job using web scrapers, pandas/matplotlib, and bloomberg API connections. \n I haven't told my team or junior peers how I do everything so much faster than them but they have some idea because they see lines of code in Jupyter on my screen all day. The most tedious part of my job has become exporting my works to excel and linking formulas when someone higher up wants to see my workings (though this is becoming less common as trust is built over time). \n I'm growing more and more keen on the idea of spending some serious time after work (which I have enough of) embarking on a more formal CS training path with a view to build a portfolio of simple apps and hopefully retrain to a full time CS career. My linear algebra is a bit rusty but I am familiar enough that I think I could get back on the horse in a few months.\n I guess I want some feedback on whether my age rules me out of transitioning to CS at a level that would be comparable to my existing career path in IB. \n edit: thank you all for your input and wisdom. my takeaway is that I should stick to my current career path (which I don't mind) but pursue cs as a side hobby to the extent that I am able to continue teaching myself. I guess FAANG is probably out of the question, and it seems that would be the only way to match the comp potential of my current job.

The most stressful aspect for me is the expectation of working overtime, even sometimes during the weekends, with no extra pay. I'm usually understanding if it's about something important, like fixing a broken feature in production, but it's a bit hard on the mental when I'm asked to work otherwise.\n It's even gotten to the point where I'm having to drop whatever I'm doing in my personal life to attend 1-2-hour meetings at 7/8pm. I'm at the point now where I carry my work wherever I go, and, by that, I mean that I'm not only anxious about being messaged about work out of the blue (say, if I'm out with friends or spending time with my parents), but I also just can't get off of work mode because of it. I can't relax.\n I've talked about this with some (and, by \"some\" I mean only 3) friends in the industry, and their advice was the same: \"Then work for a corporate company.

I created a project, FlyMile pro, a flight search engine that finds flights on credit card points. Originally designed to enhance my resume and secure internships, it surprisingly attracted over 10,000 sign-ups!\n However, recently, I've been facing some distressing challenges. The CEO of PointsYeah has accused me of scraping their website, a claim that is entirely baseless (I have my GitHub commits, my code never interacted with his site). I hadn't even heard of PointsYeah until about a month ago, when I stumbled upon a mention in a Reddit post, Despite this, I received a message threatening to shut down my site (see message screenshot).\n Last night, our website was bombarded with an unusual amount of traffic, which seemed like a deliberate attack, and I've been receiving calls from random international numbers. I even found MilesLife - his previous company having payments issues with merchants - I will not comment anything on that, you are free to explore.\n I’m feeling quite overwhelmed by this, especially since this project was meant to be a positive addition to my learning and future opportunities. I've worked hard to create something useful and educational, not just for myself but for a broader community.\n Has anyone here experienced something similar? How did you handle it?

I've never actually been in a situation like this so I have no clue how to approach the topic of compensation in my next meeting with the hiring manager. What should I even be asking for?

How would you proceed in this situation?\n Edit: Just to be clear, I got my \"market value\" of $150k by looking at websites like Levels.fyi and Blind, along with just what I've been generally seeing on job listings on LinkedIn, Indeed etc. I've been looking for 3-4 months now so I've seen A LOT of JDs.

          "description": "I've been developing since the 2000s. In the good old days, most SDEs seemed to follow a simple rule that worked well for everyone: if you don't need an answer right away or just conveying information, send an email; if you do need a quick response, send an instant message. That way, I could answer emails all at once, on my own time (usually a couple times a day). I'd only get a DM maybe every couple days \n Sometime in the late 2010s, things seemed to shift, where people just used Slack for all communications. So, in any given day, I'll get several DMs throughout the day or tags, and constantly have to divert attention from focusing on coding to respond or at least decide if it needs immediate attention. It's more difficult to focus, and I find sometimes I want to log off from Slack for several hours, even if that risks missing an actual important message.\n Anyway, what I'm saying is, make email popular again. Is it just me who's noticing this?\n EDIT: See a lot of suggestions to disable notifications, but I'm not sure it's feasible. Because there are infrequent occasions where something really is more urgent. I guess the issue isn't so much Slack vs email (Slack has its advantages), but rather there's no distinction in Slack on message priority.\n    submitted by    /u/forbidden-donut  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm a junior dev at my current company for a year now. I feel like my ego is getting into my way of growing as a dev. I'm quite and don't contribute to the team discussions because most of the time I don't know much enough to contribute to the discussions. Also, I'm not as vocal as I should of for my needs. I keep having this high ego of mine of trying to appear smart and knowledagble around my team members and I get stressed out whenever I do or say something that seems dumb that makes me lose that image. I hate being seen as dumb by my peers growing up and this mindset really hinders my growth since I'm trying to act smarter and knowledgeable than I really am. Has anyone experienced this problem and how do you deal with this? I've made mistakes at my current org where I worked on a feature that's buggy( got tested in lower env) and made it out to prod that affected consumers. I believe my reputations has been tainted by my coworkers and managers in terms of performance wise. Honestly, I haven't gotten any bad feedback from manager. When I do 1 on 1 with tech lead, they say to keep improving and work on smaller tickets. I feel like I may be laid off anytime and I'm surprised to have made it to this far as a dev\n    submitted by    /u/EitherAd5892  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been in software for just over 13 years, and I've noticed a dramatic change in how much I code. Here’s how much time I spent coding throughout my career and the general timeline of my software engineer life:\n  \n Time Frame in Career Title Time Coding \n  \n 0 to 1 year Graduate Soft Eng 75% \n  1 to 3 years Junior Soft Eng 75% \n  3 to 5 years Soft Eng 60% \n  5 to 8 years Senior Soft Eng 50% \n  8 to 13 years Lead Soft Eng 40% \n  13 to present Principal Soft Eng <5% \n \n For the most part I've been doing a lot of backend Python/AWS blah blah stuff. But with my new job I'm running several teams for 3 product lines that include front and back end. However the main issue is, as above, I do less than 5% coding per day. The rest is just solid meetings, fleshing out Jira tickets or architecture design stuff.\n I know it's a pointless metric to worry about but I can't help but get a slight bit of anxiety that I'm deskilling and losing the tricks of my trade that got me to where I am. Is this common for a jump like this? My initial Googling all points to wildly different answers, which I suspect will be voiced the same here. But some people, as Principal, say they code for upwards of 50% of the time per day.\n Am I paranoid about getting worried or is this the point of my career that I become Bill Lumbergh from Office Space and actually I'm now a \"manager\"?\n    submitted by    /u/TheRustyPilgrim  \n [link]   [comments]",

The best engineers are the ones that invest the most time into improving. Whether or not you 'love coding' is irrelevant. You can invest just as much time into something because you know you will make a lot of money in the end.\n Edit: Some people are misunderstanding what I am saying. Not being passionate does not mean hating what you do.

Fast forward to now: needed money somehow so now I repair engines. I don’t remember the last time I even coded something. \n This used to be my passion since middle school and an integral part of who I was. Weird to see me not even think about it anymore. \n I wouldn’t say I’ve totally given up… but I almost wish I didn’t get my masters so I could have gotten a real SWE job a few years ago with ease and have actual work experience so getting a job right now wouldn’t be impossible.\n Thoughts?\n (This message obviously contains some elements of slight exaggeration)\n EDIT: I don’t need “dont give up just keep trying” comments. I am aware of that. I will do so, but not at this time. I am not going to feel guilt about taking a few months off from the process of sending out hundreds of applications per month with a 99.9% rejection rate, or at least not right now I’m not. I’m burned out from doing this for a year straight. If you suggest that I will fail in my career in CS because of this then you are seriously misunderstanding the sentiment of this post. I’m not giving up on my career.\n EDIT2: thank you all for your wide variety of responses and the thoughtfulness you have put into them. I won’t retype all my replies here but I have concluded that I need to try other things than brute force spamming job applications for only SWE/web dev jobs and try to get anything to get my foot in the door + critique and revise my resume according to professional advice.

          "description": "Hey everyone, I'm currently a senior in college on track to finish all my classes this summer and apply for graduation in fall. I had picked up a job back in march at a small insurance agency to develop a CRM lead management system for the company. The reason I picked up the job was to gain experience. I am the sole developer at my job and I am not going to lie I am gaining a lot of hands on experience primarily with Node.js, React, Azure, Git, REST APIs and a bunch of other things I cant remember to list. I report directly to the agency owner who is non technical, he likes my work and constantly tells me how smart I am but I feel as though he doesn't know what he is doing sometimes. He expects a single college student to build a CRM for his agency with no guidance from a senior engineer. I believe I am doing good work at this job and he thinks im pretty good too but I feel as though he is rushing me constantly asking me for updates on the project and setting deadlines for his employees to start using the CRM by this month. I have never had anyone use software written by me before so I am unsure of how this will pan out and I don't want to be responsible for such a big project in his business. Also I feel like for the amount of responsibility I have I shouldn't be getting paid 15 an hour and due to the fact that I am graduating soon I don't see myself staying here any much longer as 15 an hour wont cut it. When he initially hired me he promised that I can move up in the company and become a manager and that there would be a pay increase. I currently have 4 months of experience working here, what should be my next move?\n    submitted by    /u/Titoswap  \n [link]   [comments]",

I see an awful lot of hang-wringing about what job to take, what to study, all that kind of stuff. \n Here's my advice - learn about personal finance - no, really - some of the best advice you'll find anywhere is here on reddit. You might not care now, but you'll thank me in 10-15 years, especially if you plan to buy a house. Take care of your health - once you get older, medical costs become a significant cost no matter your insurance, and worse if you don't take care of yourself. \n Oh, you wanted career advice? Don't worry, that will come to you in time. Don't overthink it - it's a long road. Take care of yourself first. \n P.S.

I was initially hired as \"programmer\" and assumed I'd work in a team (which I mentioned during the interview), someone more senior, or at least someone else since they had 2 openings for the position.\n I couldn't be more wrong. Let's just say the team is basically non-existent and I was the only programmer in the company.\n While I could just give half assed work that barely works, I held myself to a higher standard and even go beyond sometimes. I set up a git repository with proper branches, proper documentation, make sure everything readable, proper security (last guy didn't even encrypt the passwords), did extra research and analysis whenever possible (I double majored in Statistics), etc. Within my first 90 days I've done everything from web apps to Android and native desktop apps from ground up.\n Both my supervisor and director were always pleased with my work and often praised me, though that means nothing if I had no one else to compare my work and performance to. They've been asking if I was interested in becoming a full time employee or at least a freelance since I was already familiar with the system. I'm thinking of taking the job and continue for a year to see if there's hope before finding a job elsewhere, so I'm planning to renegotiate the \"programmer\" title.\n TLDR: I think I've been responsible for more than what \"programmer\" would reflect in my resume. Would it be okay for me to ask for Full Stack Dev or Junior Dev title? Software Engineer?

          "description": "AI is great, and I love using it, but unlike people on this sub, I never understood the fears around automation. It is quite error prone, and hallucinates often, and it looks like we may have reached a local maxima in terms of AI models (that is enthusiasm seems to have died down a bit).\n Cloud computing, though interesting in its own right, abstracts so many problems, and automates more work than AI. It only takes a few lines of code to create a dynamodb that can scale incredibly well with low latency. Same can be said about serverless, apis, and other services.\n It is incredible to me how abstracted the services are to the point that basic distributed system problems no longer require in depth knowledge (though you should probably still learn it). Same can be said with machine learning itself on an enterprise level. It is much easier to use Amazon Bedrock to create an LLM rather than learn the linear algebra behind the algorithms. The amount of code required is now reduced to just a few lines.\n For all of the attention that AI gets, cloud over abstracts and replaces a lot more work.\n EDIT: Seems like it is pretty clear now that this is a case of lower barrier to entry yields more productivity, thus more employees (thank you u/otherbranch-official) . What I do not get is why the same logic (better tools == more employees) cannot apply to AI.\n    submitted by    /u/Upstairs_Big_8495  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Looking for insight into this. \n There seem to be two major classes of software devs in tech.\n  \nFAANG & former FAANG\n other\n  \nIn FAANG & former FAANG circles, we see people with TC $150K starting out, which then quickly grows to $300K and then tops out around $450K.\n In non-FAANG circles, it's more like $80K then $130k then $210k.\n I think a lot of the chaos and confusion in the market now is due to this.\n FAANG-class jobs have always been coveted, but now there is even more pressure.\n FAANG layoffs have FAANG staff all circulating and applying to the same small pool of companies which pay at FAANG levels. The cream of the crop are of course getting jobs at or above their previous TC, but \"middle of the pack\" staff aren't getting traction\n Non-FAANG are having a much harder time flipping from the \"other\" tech jobs into the \"FAANG & former FAANG\" pool since so many people already in those jobs are circulating & looking for them. \n FAANG and former FAANG may be taking paycuts and working the \"other\" jobs for a while, but I am pretty sure they would still be actively job hunting and working their networks to get a FAANG class job to get back their previous lifestyles.\n The overall effect is everyone is having trouble finding jobs that pay at or more than they were making before.\n So there is some impact on the non-FAANG markets as well. But predominantly what we have been seeing is FAANG-class job markets becoming extremely competitive, even when compared to how competitive they have always been, whereas the non-FAANG class jobs are somewhat more competitive but not nearly as much.\n If anyone has any research or thoughts on this I would love to see / hear it.\n    submitted by    /u/NormalUserThirty  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've worked my ass off the last few months and was even promised a bonus until I saw my next paycheck was unchanged, which is when I decided I'd only work as much as I was paid.\n Now I clock in at 9 and out at 5 and encouraged my team to do the same and of course we fell behind. My boss noticed this and today I was pulled into a meeting where they played good cop bad cop: one of them would criticise my decisions and act all panicked because we aren't meeting deadlines, and the other assured us it's fine and proposed solutions. They didn't threaten my position directly, but it all felt very threatening and dehumanising since the one that roasted me is my direct higher-up and since they literally only log in two days per week to ask me for progress as the rest of their tasks they dumped on me.\n I'm beyond furious and mentally checked out of this company and I'm thinking whether to quit this week. I have savings that would last me years if I maintained my current lifestyle. Ideally, I'd take a month or two off and then start applying to new jobs.\n Would quitting now be that huge of a mistake?

I got some great feedback on my resume, and I want to thank everyone who helped.\n Here's my update: - I updated my resume based on the suggestions from the post. Some advice was contradictory, so I chose what I thought was best. - I kept applying to only remote jobs. Even though some suggested trying onsite roles, I don't think I can go back to the in-office life. - I mostly got rejections, even with the updated resume, even when I met 100% of the requirements. I stopped counting the number of applicants. I carefully read each job description and only applied when I felt qualified, taking time to answer form questions and write cover letters. I started getting discouraged and applying less and less.\n  \nI realized I was too emotionally invested in this process, so I hired a VA on Upwork. I gave him a guide on what jobs to submit for (remote in NA, mentioning Python with 5+ years of experience), two versions of my resume, and a Google form to fill out after each application. This seems to be working better. He has applied for 500+ jobs so far, and I got 10 recruiter calls and 8 tech interviews set up. Six are US-based companies looking to hire Canadians, and two are early-stage Canadian startups. For four of the eight, I don’t even match the job requirements (different tech stack), but they still wanted to interview me 🤷‍♀️.\n  \nI have my first technical interview tomorrow—a live coding session (not LeetCode/Python).\n Any ideas on how to prepare?

So in july 2022 I had interviews with Google (final round canceled cuz the hiring freezes started), amazon (final round failed because i sucked at system design), uber, tiktok, Bloomberg. This was at 1 YOE for me for SDE 1 roles.\n I didn't even apply back then in 2022, the recruiters would reach out. RTX (Raytheon) once quadruple messaged me on LinkedIn begging me to apply back then in 2022. This week after I applied they rejected me.\n Now I got laid off at vmware, and its just crickets. SDE 2 jobs are requiring 3 yoe instead of 2 now and there are no SDE 1 jobs available. I am also currently doing OMSCS at UT Austin so ik i have a strong application but its just totally fucked.\n Companies would rather take a developer with 6 yoe at Albertsons than an strong early career dev. Experience does matter a great deal, but so does a rigorous education/previous employers. Having worked @ no name before and being one of the the best python devs as an intern, I can say that 3-6 months of experience at a top tier is equivalent to 1 year at a average company.\n I know multiple people with ~2-3 yoe @ Tier 1 companies with real Research based CS masters degrees from Georgia tech, Upenn, etc... who are unemployed/have been unemployed for months\n    submitted by    /u/jptboy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have heard of people graduating from Harvard, etc who couldn't get a job in the States and had to come back to their home country and teach English. \n Pretty sure that most international CS majors, even those from top schools, won't even be able to secure an internship and even if they do, they won't be able to get a job after graduation and even if they make through it all, only an extremely small minority will be able to get a h1b and then green card and stay in the States.

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n I just wanted to make a post to see if anyone could relate to me, and if so, has any advice or just share their experience. Just graduated from a top 10 CS school, >3.5 GPA, two internships (one Fortune 500), U.S. Citizen, and hiring freeze led to no return offer. 200 total applications, all rejections. It really crushed me to make it to a round 6 and then get rejected, thats just brutal. Been desperately scrambling. \n This week, I got a 80k IT indian consulting firm job. I know this market is tough, and this is a solid starting salary with everything that's going on. \n Unfortunately, I can't help but feel angry at myself when I see my peers at Google and equivalents, making 6 figures. Some of these people used to make fun of me for struggling so hard in Computer Science. Still I persevered. I think back to my sleepless nights all the way back to high school, dozens of AP classes, all hoping for it to work out in the end, and just feel regret. I wish I didn't stress myself into depression to end up with this result.\n I don't want to see ungrateful, but I am struggling with these feelings and feeling lonely in it. At least amongst my own network, I don't know anyone who landed in the spot that I did who did not have below a 3.0 GPA and no internships. I just wanted to reach out and see if there's any other academically oriented CS grads who are in the same boat. I feel like I had an amazing opportunity at this school that I totally fumbled. Maybe I didn't spend enough time on leetcode. Maybe I could have attended more career events. Pushed a little harder in classes I got a B in. I guess it doesn't matter now.\n    submitted by    /u/Fit_Ganache2504  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "During my second semester in college, I completely disregarded academics, and my college situation is now very bad. I barely passed a few of my classes, and for some, I have nothing done.\n Instead of studying, I focused entirely on coding. I would stay up nights coding, wake up at 3 pm, having slept through all my lectures, and then go back to coding. This was my routine throughout the second semester. I find coding very fun, and I posted everything I wrote on my GitHub, which ended up being really helpful in finding a job. My plan was not to land a job like this, I just enjoyed doing it, and at a certain point I had a feeling. I don't go to college, I don't have a job, I'm achieving nothing doing this, so I decided to go after a job. I saw that many places had a minum of a bachelors degree and the other jobs were just some internships, which I applied for. After some time, I got an offer to go for a \"try-out\" at a very big company, of course I accepted.\n In the interview, the HR manager didn't ask me any coding questions; we just talked about what my job would be like and even commented on my GitHub projects. I got through the \"testing\" phase, which lasted a few months but felt really quick. After that, I received a raise and a long-term spot on the team. Despite this, I don't feel very accomplished or excited because of my college situation.\n I'm attending college to land a job in software engineering, but I managed to do that early in my college journey. Now, I will probably have to retake the second semester or just move forward with the academic debt. I want to be happy, but failing college is a big hit for me, especially since my dad didn't finish college and wants me to at least finish it. That puts a lot of pressure on me.\n I think the best move here is to hold on to this job as long as I can to gain job experience for when I need to find a new job in the future.\n    submitted by    /u/Fragrant_Treacle_348  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "(New account so HR can't identify me)\n Recently started an internship at a big tech (not FAANG but everyone would know the name) and yes, I went to search for all Linkedin profiles of other interns asa I had their names in the gc. Here's what I found:\n  \nDiversity: 60% are males. 40% white, 20% Asian, 15% black and mixed. I'm not good at telling Hispanic/Latin but at least 2 of them are. \n \nDegree: 20% Master (actually surprised me), 5-6 PhDs.\n \nPrestige: actually 50-50 between T20s (both general and CS) and \"smaller\" schools. Most are still T100 or famous liberal arts, only 2 schools I have never heard of. \n \nExperience: Here's the part I found the most interesting. For T20 kids it's pretty varied between ex-FAANG and no previous internship at all. I don't count competitions or short programs at a company. I can't find Github or personal websites for half of no experience ones so no comment on their personal projects.\n \n For others, however, everyone (yes) had at least one internship. I also count internships at other countries which I assume are home countries of international students. 90% has Github/personal websites with all more than 2 personal projects. Again not sure if I couldn't find the rest 10% or they just don't have it.\n What does this mean? Probably nothing at all. And I'm sure not companies have the same statistics. Why do I post this? Well I want to share my 4-hour \"research\" with someone but don't want my friends to judge me. \n But as a non-T20 student, I want to show that your school names won't stop you from landing big companies. However, you do have a higher bar to pass to be equivalent to prestige school kids. Again, just from my small sample size observation.\n P/s: All the numbers are rounded to the nearest 5%. There are 2-3 interns I couldn't find their Linkedin so I didn't included them. \n P/s 2: Want to do international students but no idea how to identify it.\n    submitted by    /u/AppointmentWeird2547  \n [link]   [comments]",

I literally read Newton's Principia Mathematica to impress my phy1 prof and pass on the second try. Glad those are behind me now.\n    submitted by    /u/YourAverageTurkGuy  \n [link]   [comments]",

All types of positions for entry level and for internships. I graduated with a 3.7 GPA and really saw no hope in getting a call back as I dont have any major projects. As during school I work as a research assistant for Human in the loop ML and as a CS tutor. I did grind some leetcode. \n https://preview.redd.it/dxarpk7v476d1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=79d175af290fbe04c49e4e0a8dbf181e3dccbda5\n I have gotten okay at most problems that are not hard I can solve if it doesnt have a gimmick or trick. \n I accepted the job offer at a local grocery store that has a small IT department. The pay is around 50K with full benefits of medical after 1 month of work. The job title is Systems Programmer. Honestly I am really relieved as 99% of the applications would just ghost me. I really didnt see myself getting any job related to coding. \n The did 4 interviews in total. And the technical consisted of making a simple grocery store model with classes for customers, transactions, items and stores. I expected leetcode but it was much easier than I expected. There is still hope for getting a job. \n    submitted by    /u/Marcelinob20  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since then I have been applying to jobs left and right(1300+ jobs applied). However I have not been getting any interviews. I have a summer internship on my resume and have completed a few projects in IOS Development, ML and AI. I have also gotten accepted into OMSCS at Georgia Tech and will be starting in August.\n Since January I have been sitting at home-upskilling and applying to jobs.

Therefore in order to payup my bills and student loan I have been searching for jobs nearby and got a shift leader position at Tacobell. Now even though I am not shy of working hard at a fast food place, I am feeling pity on myself as I did not get a job offer from my field. I feel like I am the problem and not skilled enough for the companies to hire me and I am worried about getting entry into the job market? I wanted to ask on this reddit community a few question:\n  \nShould I take the job at Tacobell and how should I be positive about it?\n Should I get more experience thought internships and coop? And do you have any good resources to find this internships/coops for Fall 2024.\n How can I improve my job application and get a better chance at landing an interview?

I hadn't even heard of PointsYeah until about a month ago, when I stumbled upon a mention in a Reddit post, Despite this, I received a message threatening to shut down my site (see message screenshot).\n Last night, our website was bombarded with an unusual amount of traffic, which seemed like a deliberate attack, and I've been receiving calls from random international numbers. I even found MilesLife - his previous company having payments issues with merchants - I will not comment anything on that, you are free to explore.\n I’m feeling quite overwhelmed by this, especially since this project was meant to be a positive addition to my learning and future opportunities. I've worked hard to create something useful and educational, not just for myself but for a broader community.\n Has anyone here experienced something similar? How did you handle it? Any advice on how to manage these accusations and protect my project?\n https://preview.redd.it/xwe6vmic7j5d1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=06f324a23cdd294172ace537a9d9003124e6d32e\n    submitted by    /u/Which_Extension_9576  \n [link]   [comments]",

I graduated from Cornell University with no internship experience. The only notable experiences I have are two game development projects I’ve done at Cornell, each working on a team, and one of which I was project lead.\n All of the entry level jobs I look at ask for qualifications that I don’t have, such as Microsoft SQL, REST API, Angular, etc. \n I feel scared and anxious managing my job search. \n My priority is to get entry-level experience, so I don’t really care about the pay or whatnot. Would just like to get a job to jumpstart my career. \n Any help would be appreciated. I’m not sure what to do, what to work on.

I have around 3 big projects in C++ and Python which I’m fairly proud of. I also have a few internship at my uni and at startups. Not a lot in terms of the number of places I’ve worked in, but a lot of them I’ve continued for over a year. However, I’ve yet to land an internship outside of startups and at my uni, with most applications not even getting an interview. I’ve had a few people look at my resume and I’ve incorporated their advice, but it hasn’t helped much. \n Tbh, I don’t know why I even try if recruiters don’t care about my GPA and experiences. I know my experiences can probably be a lot better, but i don’t know how to get a worthwhile experience if all my resume gets rejected. The only other reason i can think of is probably the fact that I’m on an F1 visa, and that I’m not very good at networking.\n I’m working to fix the latter over this summer but I wish that recruiters could put more weight on my existing experience and GPA, since right now it just feels like I’m trying extra for something pointless.\n    submitted by    /u/Orbital_RM  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was never assigned any buddy or mentor unlike other interns. Initially for the start two months I was assigned technical work but after that they gave me things like reaching out to people, filling excel sheets etc. Today he told me that I didn't meet his expectations and I didn't go above and beyond for this event that my team hosted (although I worked so hard even for that). He told me he's disappointed. I went and cried, I'm feeling so so bad that he's telling me now that my internship is about to end. Although I do have a full time offer already from this company but what if they rescind the offer?

I managed to solve one and another one 14/15 test cases but last one did not have time to complete so it is half solved.\n Also I hate how RNG plays a part in these OA, I had a friend that told me his questions were like 1 LC medium and 2 LC easy, one was some simple string manipulation and another a simple hashmap solution both less than 20 lines while I got shafted rip, \n Pairing all this with the constant rejections from other companies, and the occasional reach final stage to only be rejected, it gets depressing every now and then.\n Just needed an outlet to rant, sorry to put more negativity into this thread.

After going through a particularly brutal experience (5 interviews + a take-home case study) and not hearing back, I decided to work on a tool that automatically tracks your applications, matches you with positions where you’re more likely to hear back and do well, and even predicts when you've been ghosted by a company (something I constantly experienced).\n https://preview.redd.it/tyo71u9a9u3d1.png?width=2846&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb24301ef065c714e28e3d97d2862d3ecf5f0a7c\n While the tool is still in development, it's helped a few people already, so I’m looking to get feedback from other CS students to make it even better. If you’re currently looking for internships (I'm currently working with a few startups looking for interns across business, design, and technology) and are interested in using the platform or providing feedback, please PM me and I’ll share the link. I really want to make finding internships easier for everyone, since I know how difficult and frustrating the application process can be, any feedback would be amazing.

The final interview went very well. The hiring manager (Very pleasant person) was very excited about me getting started ASAP because they were behind on a few projects and had a few more incoming. At the end of the interview, she assured me that they decided to hire me and to look out for the offer letter within a day or two. I was checking my email so often that I might have broken some record or two. The next day passed and no offer. The second day passed and no offer but now I am getting really nervous. On the third day, I get an email that they have decided to go with someone else.....\n I was crushed inside. This took all the wind out of me and now every time I fill out an application, my mood just drops when I remember this experience. \n About a week after that I called the recruiter (who was present in all interviews) and kindly asked for feedback and then asked her why they went with someone else after I was explicitly told that they chose me.\n Her answer..... \"The hiring manager wanted the other candidate because he had FiveTran experience....\"\n I could not believe it. Fivetran was never brought up in the interviews and it is insanely easy to learn. I thanked her for her time and help and asked her to send me other opportunities she came across.\n Well, that is how I lost out on a Fully Remote Job with a $94k base salary at Pratt&Whittney. \n :( Thank you for your time.

          "description": "I have an internship and it's great. We develop software systems for automated vehicles. I am learning so much about CS and programming. They have me fixing bugs: there's a bug tracking system and I have access to the proprietary bug list, then I try to fix the code. It's super interesting. Obviously we don't make this public or use some open source tracker because there's a lot at stake even if it's just a simple thing like going over the speed limit once in a while. One time the system was turning on the windshield wipers in clear weather and turning them off in rain. We thought that was hilarious. \n So, we have this restricted area where there's a test track. We have to test the vehicles in a controlled environment very very thoroughly. A little while ago the test engineers became very stressed and agitated. We tried to find out why because they were mostly really smart nerds who left us alone. I was processing the bug list and I found a system video from a video where the test car ran over a kitty cat. I asked around and that was why the test engineers were so upset. It obviously wasn't their fault: after I studied the logs I figured out how a particular function misidentified the cat and failed to avoid it. The function had several logic errors in the way shapes and movement were processed. Now I have to decide what to do about it. I can fix it quietly, like I usually do. I could tell my boss or make an entry in the bug tracker that the function was programmed wrong. That could get back to the AI Vision Manager and she could be really mad. Someone could be fired over it. I don't want to make people mad at me. The bug is fixed. I think I should forget about it so I can have a good relationship with my coworkers and no one gets fired. I want to get an offer after I graduate.\n    submitted by    /u/liquidInkRocks  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A common denominator in a hardware system (be it a microcontroller, a microcomputer or a computer) is the processor (or microprocessor - a.k.a. CPU). Among its most common elements are the instruction cycle, the dedicated registers (program counter, index register, stack pointer), and the general purpose registers. We also find other external elements also managed by the processor such as memory (RAM - here the stack is also managed - & ROM), I/O peripherals, or communication buses.\n In the emulation process it is obvious to me which hardware component corresponds to each of the previously mentioned elements, which facilitates the process of encapsulation of the code. The case of emulation of the CHIP-8 interpreter creates some doubts for me.\n I understand that the CHIP-8 interpreter embedded in a microcomputer (like the console COSMAC VIP) is a program written using the instruction set of the corresponding processor (e.g. RCA COSMAC) used to execute other programs (a.k.a. ROM) written using the instruction set of the CHIP-8 interpreter itself.\n At first, reading some implementation guides, I thought that when they referred to elements like the program counter, the index register or the general purpose registers they were referring to the physical resources of the processor. However, now I doubt if these elements are virtualizations of the CHIP-8 interpreter, that is, variables that the CHIP-8 interpreter creates and manages dynamically in the RAM memory of the microcomputer.\n I imagine that it could be this way because otherwise, in case the processor PC was pointing to a ROM instruction (using the CHIP-8 interpreter instruction set) and tried to decode, it would fail. Is this how it really works? Is it not? Is it partially?\n Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't quite understand how these three elements fit together: processor, execution of the CHIP-8 interpreter and execution of the ROM.\n Thanks in advance. \n    submitted by    /u/RolindaW  \n [link]   [comments]",

The diagram here is... reasonably clear in showing how the background pixel is chosen via nametable/attribute fetches and scroll selection. But as far as I can tell it hand-waves exactly what the sprite pixel input is, simply listing [Sprites 0..7] as the input to the priority multiplexer. But what is that input?\n I've also read through Sprite Evaluation several times and I understand the relationship between OAM and secondary OAM; the latter holds the 8 sprites chosen for the upcoming scanline. But clearly it isn't the direct input into pixel selection because it's reset in the first 64 cycles of the current scanline. The details section lists that the secondary OAM data is \"fetched\" on cycles 257-320, but fetched to where?\n In javidx9's series he uses a shift register per scanline sprite (for 8 in total) which seems logical, it's essentially an extension of how background tiles work, but he seems to present this as the most straightforward way to do it in his emulator rather than a reflection of anything in the underlying hardware.\n The nesdev wiki doesn't seem to document what that sprite input is.

Then the game loads as usual. \n IE: 0b0000'0001 | IF: 0b000'0001\n JOYP [FF00]: 0b1111'1111\n \n I press the mapped \"Start\" button: \n IE: 0b0000'0001 | IF: 0b0001'0000\n JOYP [FF00]: 0b1101'0111\n \n I release the mapped \"Start\" button: \n IE: 0b0000'0001 | IF: 0b0001'0000\n JOYP [FF00]: 0b1111'1111\n \n  \nAnd nothing happens. IE never becomes 0b0001'0001 in order to enable the interrupt. One source I read claims that that most games do not use this interrupt for joypad inputs.\n Interestingly, if I keep pressing \"Start\", at some point, the game registers that it has been pressed, and the screen advances. I have done the same with the other buttons, where the game loads, and I will, for example, press \"Left Arrow\" and the character will move, after like 50 button presses.\n Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated!

          "description": "Currently, we are a small company where the ops team consists of one manager and a few ICs (including myself). We initially hoped to expand the ops team, but due to a pivot in product direction, we had to let some members go and condense the team. Now, the team realistically won't be growing much.\n From my understanding, the role of an engineering manager, especially for ops, is to set priorities, shield their team from the bureaucracy of the other C-levels, and manage reviews and career growth. However, I've encountered a few roadblocks due to our manager's lack of technical expertise:\n - Communication Issues: The manager acts as a middleman, relaying requirements from other VPs to our team and then passing our feedback back. This has backfired because he doesn’t fully understand the technical asks from other teams.\n - Unclear Priorities: It's unclear whether the principal engineer or the engineering manager should set technical priorities. This has led to some discord.\n - Indecisiveness and Micromanagement: The manager seems indecisive, avoiding assigning tasks to avoid conflict, yet becomes micromanaging when tasks aren't completed as expected.\n While he is a good people person, his lack of technical skills and decisiveness is impacting the team. My teammates feel the same way. I’m looking for advice from fellow engineers who have had similar experiences. Currently, my plan is to collate examples and discuss them with my team, then have a talk with him to provide feedback. If there’s no change, we may need to escalate the issue to his boss. However, I want to give him a chance to respond to our feedback first before taking it higher.\n Anyone else have this issue?

The scope is on-prem and in the cloud, so multiple tenants as well.\n Most engineers can‘t be arsed to do shit themselves: - they buy software which needs to run on the container platform but they have nobody to take care of the release management, they come ask us - they ramp-up product teams with deadlines but don‘t have the staff with the necessary knowledge, they come ask us - they don‘t have the justification for hiring a full time devops engineer because the product is relatively small, they come to us - they don‘t care, they come to us - we racked up massive tech debt, so shit breaks all the time because we were trying to „enable“ engineers resistant to learning, they of course come ask us\n The idea to prevent us from drowning and do our actual job would be to ramp-up a team which just takes care of these operative tasks for other teams and offer it as-a-service.\n Thank you for listening to my rant\n    submitted by    /u/muchasxmaracas  \n [link]   [comments]",

But now you want to add one or several hotfix commits to production, but not release the in progress features already out on staging. What's the best way to do that?\n  \nHave two long lived branches, e.g. develop and main. If you merge a hotfix/ branch to main, it now builds and releases a second image: prod+hotfix. Automation can merge the hotfix commit back to develop (?) so it's also out on staging. But this way you have to build artifacts, ugh.\n Stay with one long lived branch, check out the latest released tag (representing the current state of prod), add your hotfix and build a new image off that branch for production, and merging to main will also add the hotfix commit to staging. Again two artifacts, and the prod image will be built off a short lived hotfix branch?\n  \nHow do smart people handle this?

Meaning no code repo, no pipelines. The only tech they have was previously done by a vendor to create their current application which is currently running on Azure AKS.\n Long story short, I felt that before I can even do any development, a proper dev environment is required, meaning owning code repo, CI/CD pipelines till deployment (staging/prod)\n I have roughly pieced out the picture and would appreciate everyone’s input on whether this is feasible.\n Git repo - Gitlab. Even though i’ve never used gitlab before, it seems to be the best/easiest to conduct CI/CD.\n In the gitlab-ci yml, Im thinking of having diff stages like testing, before building and pushing the image to a container registry.\n The container registry I’m thinking of using Azure Container Registry since the company already uses Azure. \n From there, I believe AKS can pull the image and deploy as a Kubernetes cluster.\n As for the infra, Im thinking of using Terraform for proper versioning. Ive also read about K9 which helps manage the K8s.\n So in short, if my understanding is correct, i can have tests, build image, push image to Container Registry, deploy and run the image as Kubernetes in AKS, all within the Gitlab-ci yml? If that is so, gitlab is really impressive.\n Did I miss any crucial parts in this pipeline?

          "description": "Hello everyone, I have just entered my 40s and am an average-skilled software developer.\n In the past, I have some experience in developing CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitLab, and now I am currently working as a React/Java developer. Recently, I received an offer to work as a DevOps engineer at a large corporation that heavily uses Jenkins.\n The reason they are hiring me, someone with a mixed career of development and CI/CD experience, instead of a DevOps expert, is probably because their Groovy scripts have become very large and complex, necessitating a dedicated software engineer to refactor/manage them. My main responsibilities would be developing and maintaining Jenkins pipelines for on-prem legacy systems, which would account for about 60-70% of my work, with the remainder involving DevOps tool development using Python and shell scripts, and cloud infra automation tasks as some of their services are running on the cloud. I feel that if I stay here for 3-4 years, I might find it difficult to come back to a developer or work on anything other than managing legacy Jenkins tasks, yet the salary is 30% higher than my current one, which makes the decision challenging. TBH, I don't have extensive experience in managing Jenkins, so I'm not sure if the job is going to be terrible or surprisingly manageable..\n Would you take a 30% salary increase to manage legacy Jenkins systems? What would you do in my situation? If I manage to become a Jenkins expert with moderate experience in infrastructure automation through tools like Terraform or Ansible, would that make me still competitive in the market as a DevOps professional?\n    submitted by    /u/CommonOnionHello  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also added some status checks on our repos to improve the code quality that devs are adding on to our app but I keep on getting complains as to why they need to wait for those checks to finish everytime they have a PR. Our Dev lead keeps on insisting that we should keep our responsibilities only for deployment and not care about the code(in terms of quality and vulnerabilities) they are adding on to the repo.

My boss wrote them from scratch and what we do every time we have a new microservices or app is copy the last one and modify it. So far so good… However we have a very complex and flexible hierarchy of values, templates, and stuff that I don’t even know if they’re normal terms — trigger files and seed files, which a python script takes as inputs to generate the app set.\n We have a multi-tenant architecture in regions all over the world in both AWS and Azure, and of course many environments, including the standard dev/qa/prod as well as cloud vs on-prem, so this is part of the reason for the open-ended nature of the way he designed things. It feels like a very loose (undocumented) framework that requires complete knowledge in. It’s pure gitops which I love, but often I find myself staring at a yaml and wondering what something does, how it fits in, and if it’s overridden somewhere else. I spend a lot of time recursive grepping, looking at Argo overrides (I hate the tag bubble format), and in general wasting time. \n In a way this reminds me of Puppet hiera, but obviously more complex. The fix for that was Foreman with the UI that had taxonomy and inheritance. Is there anything like that for helm values? Is there any automation tool or popular framework that creates standardized app sets? (And helm charts?) Again the parallel would be something like creating an rpm from scratch vs having a polished script or tool like fpm to standardize the process. I’d love to have a Wizard-like tool guide me through the process. “Does your app need to talk to kube-API? No? Then you don’t need a dedicated service account.

I can see from their website that it might indeed be cheaper, but hard to know if there's any other hidden fees. As for more secure I also couldn't find much info that wasn't from Oracle themselves. Plus we're not using a DB, we mostly use EC2, S3, a VPC and load balancer from AWS.\n As for company connections, do companies really connect over the backend servers they use?\n I'm trying not to be too negative, but I'm struggling not to think that my manager was just given the sales pitch for something that will at best be the same but with a different company.\n Edit: Thanks for all the replies, I’m definitely going to have another meeting and if the manager is too far gone then that’s a big red flag (more than what’s already happened). \n    submitted by    /u/astrellon3  \n [link]   [comments]",

AAP is the majority of my day, gitlab, building out automations in service now, using terraform in places, most of my automations center around provisioning networking(layer 2-3, BGP, etc), firewalls, hypervisors, storage, VMs. \n It's been fun, but with the Broadcom acquisition, the money has been drying up, I've seen so many of my work family fired. I've been losing the war to inflation as my pay hasn't kept up with my increasing costs. I'm starting to think I need to find a new workplace. I'm afraid to even go through application cycles because I don't have AWS/Azure on my resume and you just don't see job postings that are akin to who we would hire.\n Do I hammer out a cloud cert?

Public cloud isn't an option for compliance reasons.\n The team I've just joined is wrangling about the container solution for the new platform. The user traffic they get is not that big. It is certain to increase as they scale up, although I couldn't say how much exactly. It doesn't feel like the stack is complex enough to go to K8s just yet. If it was AWS I would probably be pushing for ECS, because it's a good choice for small-to-medium scale workloads, it can go quite a long way before needing to migrate to K8S, and it's pretty straightforward to get going with.\n But this is the on-prem world which is all new to me. I'm not sure what ECS equivalents there are, or whether there even are any and maybe it's normal to just go to K8s. Plus I'm aware that thinking of 'equivalents' is perhaps not the right way to approach things, but it is just new territory that I'm trying navigate. They currently use Docker Swarm. I don't know much about it but some people I've spoken to have been quite derisive of it.\n Any input? Also curious to hear of experiences from anyone who switched from AWS/public cloud to on-prem, what challenges you found and what kind of things you had to get used to.\n Edit: When I say K8s I'm also including managed K8s services like Rancher and Openshift. If we do go with K8s I highly doubt we'll be doing it from scratch, that would be hellish.\n    submitted by    /u/Coffeebrain695  \n [link]   [comments]",

Done some automation with docker, powershell, and ansible. Done some powerbi and excel pivot tables. Now working on APIs, AI and bot projects. I feel like all this can be summed up as a devops engineer already. But it's mostly been support for 11 years. Salary is $90K. I want to double that before I turn 40. 35 now. I learned linux mostly from one other job and my own home server. Before that was sysadmin windows and hardware for 9 years.\n Is this enough to apply for devsecops positions in the next couple of years? I want to focus on backend engineering. I like being a linux expert, I like the scripting and I love to use python when I can. I'd like to pivot away from support and maintenance to just development and little interaction with clients. Wouldn't mind checking out quant either. I am currently leaning on my dev team at my current company to help me out and take me under their wing in the next few months or so. I plan to stay at this company for at most 3 years. but won't look down on any $180k offers that may come my way before that haha What should I look for after that?\n    submitted by    /u/moderatenerd  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I work at a company that tends to have an \"all hands on deck\" incident culture, very similar to this post from r/sysadmin. My team owns an application networking infrastructure platform that has internal developer teams as our customers.\n We have built our platform to be almost completely self-service to developer teams, including providing telemetry tools (logs, metrics, traces) that developers can use to troubleshoot problems that pass through our platform.\n However, our team has noticed a pattern during incidents where a developer team and/or their leadership will pull our team into incident troubleshooting meetings if our platform is involved at all in the impacted business/application flow (ex: Client -> Platform 1 -> App 1 -> Our platform -> App 2).\n As a result of this, our team has become more efficient on ruling out our platform from the problem (using the same self service telemetry tools mentioned before). For 95+% of incidents, our platform is not the problem and it ends up being an issue with another developer teams application. This efficiency has saved us a lot of time and avoided blame for incidents, but the constant pull for our team still adds up and results in a lot of wasted time on these incident meetings.\n From a business perspective, leadership wants us involved whenever possible to reduce business impact and MTTD/MTTR. We are struggling to find a way to change the organizational culture where developers will use our self service tools to troubleshoot incidents rather than relying on us to interpret the telemetry for them.\n Have you all had similar experiences at your companies as platform owners? If so, how did you improve this culture so that your team reduces toil and gets more time to work on platform improvements/features?\n    submitted by    /u/vinnishi  \n [link]   [comments]",

So far I've been thinking maybe I could set up Ansible Playbooks and run them across all the VMs targeting their operating system, that's the first thing that comes to mind.

          "description": "Hi guys,\n Right now I have several different UI apps which are on different domains.\n I want to move them all to a single domain and separate them by an url path, for example:\n www.foo.bar/grafana\n www.foo.bar/rabbitmq \n The way I've envisioned this is that I'd be using nginx proxy_pass to forward requests to local services with a config like that:\n location /grafana/ { proxy_pass https://grafana.local/; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host; proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding; sub_filter_types *; sub_filter_once off; sub_filter \"src=\\\"\" \"src=\\\"grafana/\" } \n , but I've encountered 2 problems: \n  \nHtml is trying to download resources from base domain, not from domain + path. So for example if there is some element in html having src=\"path/style.css\" browser will try to download from www.foo.bar/path/style.css and not www.foo.bar/grafana/path/style.css. This will obviously fail as nginx won't know what to do with this request.\n This can be dealt with using \"sub_filter\" directive (with some pain) so it's not that bad. However, the next problem is much worse. \n \nRedirects\n The problem is very similar to the previous one. When I go to the grafana index page it redirects me to /login path. The issue is that it will take me to www.foo.bar/login and not www.foo.bar/grafana/login. I haven't found any way of dealing with this and it's preventing me from proceeding. Grafana is kind enough to give you root_url config which is made for situations like these, but rabbitmq or kafka-ui and other services simply don't. \n \n Anyone has any experience with stuff like this? \n    submitted by    /u/Present_You_5294  \n [link]   [comments]",

My current role exposes me to a wide range of tech (AWS, CI/CD, Terraform, GitHub/GitLab, ECS/Docker, Datadog, scripting, etc.) and even some Python work with Data and Analytics teams. However, the one thing missing is that feels substantial (to me?) is Kubernetes (k8s) experience – at a previous role I used it for just over 1 year. Our tech stack is composed mostly of EC2/ASG (bootstrapped with poorly written chef from a company we bought, bleh), Lambda, CDNs, some ECS and API GW.\n I’m 29, and while my current company offers room for advancement to senior roles and beyond, I’m worried that not having more k8s experience, right now, could impact my career for the worse. There’s a possibility we might use Kubernetes in the future as we are in the early stages of migrating most of our applications to containers and ECS, and if the use case for orchestration arises, but it’s not certain.\n Would you recommend jumping to a new job where k8s exposure is guaranteed, or should I stay put and hope for future opportunities with k8s at my current company?\n Looking forward to your advice!\n TL;DR:\n Enjoy my current DevOps job with good pay and growth potential, but lacking Kubernetes exposure.

Both have 10+ YOE. One was hired at a managerial level, one as a Senior (though not staff) Engineer.\n Both have, frankly, struggled. I'm not a typical Junior (had 20+ years of experience in management outside of Tech before moving into an IC role), so even though I've still got a lot to learn about IT, the director and VP have come to me about people management issues, and I keep suggesting caution and patience.\n Every DevOps Engineer that I've seen start with us, it takes about 6 months to get to a level of proficiency where you can start producing individually across the organization. I think that Seniors (and Managers) get a lot shorter of a leash when it comes to this kind of thing - they have higher expectations to 'hit the ground running.' But my experience is that they do not 'ramp' any quicker, and may in fact ramp up more slowly.\n I don't think this is an ageist thing on my part (again: am old), and our most productive DevOps by FAR is a guy who is a 'Super Senior' - he's staff level, has been here for 10+ years, and is a master. But again - he's been here for ten years.\n I was reading a book where a physicist decries that he's 'too old' at 30 to make any major discoveries, and the paradigm of an athlete (where you're cooked after 10-15 years professionally) fit a little too well onto the DevOps Engineers I know.\n TL;DR - Do DevOps's have an expiration date? Is it harder to join a new team when you're more experienced? Or am I just seeing outliers and trying to draw a trend line that doesn't exist?\n    submitted by    /u/BigNavy  \n [link]   [comments]",

My company are transitioning from a monolithic architecture to breaking this up into microservices for future scaling and deployment of individual components. \n We already have broken a few services out of the monolith into independant microservices, but there are now plans to do all.

Is the best route to break up the monolith and after everything is running as its own docker container, port this to k8s, or is it better to transition the current microservices to k8s and the break up the monolith and add to the kubernetes cluster as I go? \n I ask because both routes involve a lot of work, and anyone with a bit of experience of doing something similar in the past can share any knowledge or do's/don'ts when approaching this.

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I'm investigating how to set up integration tests in our project, we do not have any tests in place at the moment. We are using NodeJS/NestJS on the backend side, and everything is deployed as AWS lambdas using a serverless framework. We use Postgres SQL database.\n What I've discovered so far is that there are a couple of ways how can you implement integration tests but there are still some uncertainties.\n First option: Running integration tests during CI/CD\n  \nThe issue here is that our build already takes ~10-15-20 minutes. So it would additionally slow it down even more. Also, we would need to spawn a new environment (not all services, part of the services that are needed for integration tests, database, etc.) before the PR gets merged (since you can not run integration tests with new code since the code is not yet deployed). The issue with spawning environments is the serverless framework which does not have an option to do it in regular way (at least I haven't found it). For these purposes, we could use Terraform or AWS SAM but it takes time to switch to these IAAC tools and we need to start using integration tests as soon as possible.\n  \nSecond option: Running integration tests nightly\n  \nThis looks like a better option to me personally since we would use the existing test environment and every night with deployed code we would run integration tests and fix them tomorrow. The downside is that the code that does not work might be deployed anyway, but I don't see an issue with it since we have weekly releases and once code is deployed to a specific environment we leave it there for ~7 days.\n  \nI would appreciate your opinion or advice on which practices to implement and apply and if you think that my favorite option (second option) is not the best approach here.\n Also, I assume for NodeJS/NestJS we should just Jest testing framework?\n    submitted by    /u/vidara15  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have to deploy infra that makes uses of a 10k+ lines of terraform and I feel constantly lost and usually nobody awnsers any of my questions. Sometimes I think 70% of my team doesnt know what is going on in the templates.\n Already I feel the urge to move to another job again, but this will look bad on my resumee. I have the feeling that it is about me, but I just really struggle usually with the way of working and feeling useless.\n I am not a genius but I have the feeling I am not stupid either, I just get really frustrated really quick with dealing with other people's over engineered stuff.\n Maybe I just need to be okay with not adding value yet after 1 month of working in this place. But I just have the feeling freelancing is more my thing. But for this my experience is still a bit lacking.\n Now I am curious if other people also feel like they dislike all companies they have worked for. Do I just suck it up? Do people have advice of how to care less about the job?\n Thanks in advance\n EDIT: Thanks for everyone that took the effort to apply.

By the time we get through the quarterly upgrade cycle we’re planning it again 8-12 weeks later. Unlikely to get buy in on switching to ECS due to onprem move planned next year. \n I’ve got another 8 or so AWS accounts mostly serverless, ec2 pets in a mixture of cloudformation and SAM. I’d ideally like this moved to cdk to empower developer self service. Because my team need to help deploy new resources via cloudformation an a lot of clickops has snuck in. \n My existing team are familiar with terraform and our terragrunt stack but would struggle with creating new modules or using a public one to implement something. \n They know a bit of bash but not python or node so cdk will be a massive leaning curve imho (but I picked up enough typescript in 3 months to support cdk within my former team to support developers and using a bit of ChatGPT and cdk got some automation lambdas working!) as they more so come from onprem world and dabble on cloud/devops. \n Assuming I have the opportunity to hire 2-3 devops engineers from an AWS consulting partner and they worked within my team how would I best use them? \n I don’t have any infa patterns to hand over and I’m capacity constrained due to being a contributor to other projects as well as acting lead. \n    submitted by    /u/hashkent  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ancient, arcane, not a proper \"language\"\n Having learned Groovy through its use in Jenkins it seems like a great option. Modern, proper \"language\". How can BASH compete with the power of {closure}.delegate?\n But it looks like Groovy has had its day and other than Jenkins isn't widely used. r/Groovy is nearly dead\n (I also have the prospect of our DevOps stack being moved to GitLab in future)\n What would you suggest is a way forward that maximizes my learning effort? (And my learning becomes my teaching for juniors in the department)\n A) Learn BASH. It IS a proper language once you understand it. Its never going away, the skill will always be in demand\n B) Use Groovy. Rumours of its demise are greatly exaggerated.\n C) Get PowerShell on the Linux nodes It's cross-platform for this exact reason. It's 'widely' used (in both Windows and Linux world) The Linux DevOps might roll their eyes but f&*k those insular assholes\n D) Learn \"XYZ Language\" (eg PYTHON?) - that's the thing that fills this gap you're describing and will remain so for a decent amount of time. How did you not know this?\n E) Something else... tell me, eg \"Stop thinking like a developer... DevOps coding is different to Application coding\" (we're gonna have an argument about this are we? ;)\n Because this is Windows v Linux I'm expecting trolls, but I really appreciate any serious replies\n    submitted by    /u/psyFungii  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just as the title says. What are some opinions about development you use to believe strongly in, but have changed over the years. What has changed them? Was it any new experiences? \n A few of mine are below:\n  \nI don't really care for DRY anymore. 10 years ago, I tried to make my code as DRY as possible, but now I don't mind repetition\n This changed due to moving to writing Go professionally. I started to notice that making Go DRY felt like a code smell. I will create an abstraction if I understand the code enough. But I use to be obsessed with this.\n \nI don't think dynamic languages are that great on the backend. I use to think it was only performance, but lack of a type system is a big problem. I use to try to make Python and Ruby code work in the backend. You can certainly write code faster in those languages, but they feel like liabilities.\n \nMemory safety maybe isn't that great anymore. As a Go dev who use to be a Java dev. All I know are JVMs. But I've found garbage collection gets in the way, and optimizing or building around the GC is quite a pain. It requires very specialized knowledge of the language, and learning how to save allocations. In Go's case it can lead to some very unreadable code. And in Java you have to really learn how to tune the JVM. I also think Rust borrow checker and lifetime semantics actually creates a lot of complexity.\n \n And that's it.

          "description": "First of all, I’d like to thank this sub for being helpful on my journey where I currently don’t have senior colleagues. \n The problem: it’s an early-stage startup. We’re just two developers: I’m around the mid level, they’re a co-founder and have no programming/CS background (basically junior), there’re no seniors and no CTO. Unfortunately, lately, I realized that the code they have been written is not well-thought and doesn’t allow to develop new features fast (we haven’t had code reviews because of tight deadlines). It also seems to me that everyone has been doing things their way, so there’s no consistency (linter is set up but seems to be ignored). \n Long story short, I failed with delivering expectations because I had to spend extra time by untangling what was written prior me. (I’m not a genius myself and provide nonoptimal/bad solutions too). I believe, though, it would be quite important to communicate to my boss that they need to revise their approach to writing code if they want us to be efficient and to be able to work together. I don’t think they’re aware of the issue. So far their main argument and approach was “It works. Users don’t care”, which I agree with but I also think there should be some balance because it’s getting harder to have a collaborative work. \n Should I tell my boss that they need to work on their code? If yes, how would you communicate it politely without pointing any fingers? Or does it sound like a hopeless situation and it’d be better to just give up on it and start looking for something else?\n TL;DR: my boss is a co-founder, not an SWE but contributes to the codebase. Lately, it’s been really hard to get through their code and work efficiently. They don’t seem to be aware of it. Should I tell them and how, or the situation is hopeless because of the power imbalance, and I should just give up and start looking for something else?\n    submitted by    /u/highwayxcavalier  \n [link]   [comments]",

If someone had asked me to redesign the system I was refactoring, I wouldn't be able to do it since I didn't really understand it.\n Also, this kind of underlies bus factors etc, where a person leaves the company and you have software systems that you now only have statistical control over, but not intellectual control any more.

He resigned and I was basically thrown into his position with no plan to replace him.\n Manager read out a new job title to me, explicitly said your role is changing, more design docs, mentoring, less coding. And working on the companies biggest project to date. \n As soon as this happened I asked to be compensated for the extra responsibility and new role. Seemed like a perfectly reasonable ask. Manager spoke with his, and came back with \"actually this is all already part of your current role, so there will be no promotion or compensation adjustment\". Then I got some corporate manager bullshit about how it's an opportunity for me etc etc...\n Seems like an opportunity for them to take advantage of me... They have no plan to rehire the guy that just left, clearly they think I can step in that role and do it successfully. \n Another engineer just below me just also handed in his notice and we effectively have a small team of 2 left. \n I complained again saying it's bullshit and told my manager how I feel, that they're taking advantage of me and told him I'm very unhappy here. Have a follow up meeting with his manager now on Monday. \n My manager is quite shit at his job so I feel like he just asked my skip to deal with me. Doubt there will be a favourable outcome for me here. \n Been interviewing for new jobs. Think it's time to bail. \n Am I being unreasonable?

          "description": "TLDR; Silo’d into monitoring and debugging prod on my own in addition to dev work. It’s tiring and i’m trying to understand what monitoring should look like.\n For context, the majority of my career (4 YOE) has been spent working on internal facing apps where the desired “monitoring” has just been send a message in a Teams channel if something breaks. \n I’m now with my first project that’s customer facing, and as we approached our go-live last year there was a last minute scramble to figure out how we were going to monitor prod. Myself and another dev ended up getting asked to monitor our apps for 2 weeks following the go-live. A year later, that dev has moved on but I’m still stuck monitoring our applications (granted I at least have a half decent Splunk dashboard now). \n I gotta be honest, it’s really exhausting. When I find an issue, Im expected to do a write up consisting of finding the root cause and determining the impact, which is usually not a quick and easy task. And I wouldn’t be complaining too much if I wasn’t expected to continue to work cards as a developer as well. Lately I’ve been working 10-12 hours days just to keep up with the workload. I’m tired. \n This isn’t normal, is it? The seniors and leads above me acknowledge it’s a bad solution, but project management is fine with it for the most part. I’m struggling to find a way out of this, conversations about getting help have gone no where and any efforts I’ve made towards off loading this have been ignored. I understand I could take the initiative to learn Splunk best practices, but I genuinely do not have the energy to take that on. Should monitoring fall on a single developer, should it be a shared effort amongst a dev team? Or are there other roles that typically handle this?\n Apologies for the rambling and thank you for reading. \n    submitted by    /u/Very_Indecisive  \n [link]   [comments]",

From what I've seen: \n  \nthis company is really only using lambas in the backend layer (apparently coming from a larger monolith, but everything is just being broken down into just lambdas). \n There's over 1000 of these, from what I can see, and it's hard to know how each of these interact with each other.\n Also using nano-frontends as well, but our team doesn't really touch those\n \n Local dev environments are extremely hard to set up (with said lambdas), and sometimes the only way to test things are to push to a shared staging environment (before pushing to pre-prod)\n Everything is in javascript (even the backend). No TS, no frameworks or DI, just pure javascript.\n  \nAnd some other things I've noticed:\n  \nJira tickets are not well defined. I don't know where the PMs are but tickets have no AC, just \"do this thing\" without any context \n Also don't really see any test plans written out for these tickets\n \n \"Teams\" are not well defined, but there's lots of them. Seems like our team is taking on tickets that are for other teams (or other teams just kinda dump them on us, which is a legacy team from what I'm gathering) \n And it seems the engineers are the ones who have to really push back. Again I don't know where the EMs or PMs are with this (I suspect they're just super stretched thin)\n \n Thank god there are some unit tests, but I don't know how strong our E2E suite is on pre-prod.\n  \nThere's a bunch of other things I'm learning about the ecosystem (such as SDK management and manual upgrading of packages) and I'm sure more gems that I haven't seen yet.\n I'm just wondering if this is more of a new normal for medium sized companies or if there's more red flags than yellow here.\n    submitted by    /u/Groove-Theory  \n [link]   [comments]",

My new job is also a lead engineer position (same as before) in a consulting company that also has some SaaS products. The problem is that I see serious red flags and I am thinking about if it's worth to invest my time and energy in it.\n  \nThey seem to have a buzzword driven development. The architecture is a Microservices, event based (Kafka) application. What they process is like 100k events a month. I don't see any justification for this over engineering.\n There are so many services and queues for allmost everything, which would be easily done by just calling a function.\n It's not possible to debug the system for several components, mostly python stuff. They really commit code and deploy it to k8 to debug these components. I have seen 100 commits for one feature just for debugging.\n Most components have no dependency management at all. Not even a simple requirements.txt for python related stuff. \n The core developers left the company and there was one week for the handover of these critical components.\n The documentation is almost non-existent.\n  \nI am now there for 1 month and it seems like the part of the system what I should take care off is a bunch services that are at prototype-level experiments put to production. Almost all best practices are missing and it seems like they are constantly pushing for new features, instead fixing the mess.

          "description": "Hi,\n I'm currently working at a Fortune 500 company as a Mid/Senior Engineer with around 6 years of experience. I earn approximately $150k total compensation (140k base + 10k bonus) and work 10-20 hours per week.\n Our department's workload is light because we're waiting to migrate a core component to production, which has been delayed several times. The next major project is a massive system rewrite spanning multiple teams and likely taking years, but it's unclear how much work our team will have. Our team lead is still trying to secure work for us.\n My current tasks involve making a few enterprise requests, editing Terraform files occasionally, and debugging issues—mostly grunt work. \n Even when debugging issues arise, a junior engineer or another engineer often jumps in and takes over, even though I'm supposed to be the go to person for this. This is particularly frustrating because it feels like I'm being sidelined. Perhaps I've asked too many questions or come across as annoying, or maybe he's simply quicker to respond. Recently, he was included in a triage meeting while I wasn't, which has really affected my self-esteem. I might be overthinking it, but it's been bothering me a lot.\n Any interesting projects are quickly taken by our lead engineer and his preferred contractor.\n While I don't consider myself a \"rockstar\" engineer, I take pride in my problem-solving skills. However, the lack of challenging work is causing my skills to stagnate, and I'm worried about losing my edge.\n I'm feeling uncertain about my career and regret choosing a role at a boring insurance/finance company. Although I'm interviewing elsewhere, it's tough to even get interviews now. My interview success rate has dropped from around 60% to about 5%.\n I'm feeling lost and unsure about how to progress in my career. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Apologies for the long post.\n Edit: Grammatical errors \n    submitted by    /u/vampyfreak  \n [link]   [comments]",

I went and explained a lot of my frustrations to our CEO, he promised to look into it and get my answers. Within an hour the CTO sat me down with our CEO, and he told me straight to my face he did not see me as someone who would be capable as a tech lead, nor someone capable of running a team. In his mindset as i am too \"rigid\" and not willing to take \"risks\".\n I was really taken back, but just accepted it as i realized that yeah with my salary and having less on my plate was fine. I then burned all my vacation time and asked our CEO if he would be willing to let me have a month off paid. He let me. \n So i went away and spent almost 3 months fully expecting to be let go when i came back. I removed slack from my phone, and went with my SO on an extended vacation, spent a bunch of time polishing resume and working on leet code for a month. It was amazing. \n I came back and i was not let go. I even switched teams internally to our AI team, to pump up my resume in case i am let go. Last month i got another 10% pay raise for my \"excellent\" work from my manager, and our CTO inquired about if i would be willing to step up to become a staff engineer with no real pay raise. I said no. \n I work maybe 20 hours a week now including meetings completely remotely, do my tasks for our sprint, then clock off. It has been the happiest i ever have been. I am paid more than any other engineer by far, however i am in constant fear i losing my job.

We are part of a medium-sized engineering department with 400 people.\n Everything was perfect when we started as a small team of 8 building the app. We produced high-quality code with very few bugs. Last year, my team doubled in size to 15 people. Now, we are more prone to bugs and errors, partly due to the hiring of some inexperienced developers.\n Earlier this year, we launched the app and it was a great success. The engineering department now thinks it’s a good idea to integrate React and backend engineers into our team for a \"learning\" experience. However, these inexperienced developers are committing atrocious code. It only slows us down and increases the number of bugs. Just today, I was browsing our app and landed on a page I worked on a month ago. The page has become unusable because a React developer \"worked\" on it, introducing numerous anti-patterns.\n I'm not even sure what we are working on anymore. I keep finding pages and features that we weren't made aware of.\n You might argue that our PR process should improve, but it’s impossible to review every PR when 7 other teams are committing their code to the mobile codebase. I now spend most of my time either reviewing PRs or helping someone learn Swift.\n How much of a red flag is this?

          "description": "I want to get people’s opinion on this. I have dealt with hands off managers who may still be technical. I have also dealt with hands on managers who jump in and write a lot of code themselves. I will say that in almost every case where managers are writing code it’s pretty much a disaster.\n Now there are cases where teams are tiny, only consisting of maybe 3 members and a lot of work. So managers may have no choice but to write code. In some startup situations it makes sense. But it should be looked at as temporary and not something permanent.\n I have found managers who write code tend to get requirements and not share them with the team. Building things in secret. Or they just don’t allow the team to do any interesting work, only leaving them scraps to work with. They can also just push their code across in code reviews because they are the boss. And even if they allow their code to be reviewed they can just ignore comments and bypass all the checks or coerce reviewers to approve their code anyway. Also they can just push their code across and it doesn’t have to be QA’ed.\n I have ran into this. Where our manager created a caching layer due to an optimization roadmap. We have no clue he had been working on this service. And it was kind of an agreement he had between himself and my VP. They both agreed he should work on it because they needed to get this deliver quickly and the normal process would be cumbersome. This was launched in prod. Disaster struck. Due to a threading issue customers were seeing other customer account info. This was a phased deployment so the impact was only 1% in a specific region. But this should have never made it to production at all.\n I have also found managers who code don’t develop good teams. Again they hog up all the interesting work. Refuse to share their knowledge or let anyone work on things they are working on. And it just feels toxic to me. \n But what are you opinions? Any scenarios that may contradict my opinions?\n    submitted by    /u/branh0913  \n [link]   [comments]",

This thing handles pricing info for my company and is cobbled together with VB, old .NET, and massive stored procedures. There’s zero automated tests or documentation. Just a couple of senior folks who have the tribal knowledge to keep this beast on life support.\n Here’s the kicker: one of them is always drowning in their own dev work, and the other is perpetually trapped in meetings.

It’s always “I’m right, you’re wrong, just do it my way so I can get back to my meeting.”\n I hate being bullied in meetings and during tasks.

I can't really delegate to anyone because all of the capable engineers left my team since they're sick of working with me. The junior engineers regularly message my manager because I can't fix their problems and it's hurting their ticket completion rates. I've received scathing rebukes from colleagues calling me lazy and unqualified ever since college, even though I did the work and graduated with a master's in CS from a state school with a 3.7 GPA.\n The final nail in the coffin was when I was rebuked by a colleague today for not completing an extensive performance test, which is a criteria for releasing a much-needed feature. I had a lot of higher priorities including company-wide shipblockers to fix, yet millions of dollars are on the line. In my opinion releasing a slow feature is the best we can do at this point anyways, but that's not enough.\n The fact is that I will emerge into a job market with NO references, and the company will report me as No Rehire when prospective employers do reference checks. It's the only job I've had since college.\n I'm not looking for validation, and I've been working on my flaws. Yet when expectations go up faster than I can fix my flaws, it's frankly time to go.

In fact, the only time I seem to interact with my manager is when I need approval for time off or have HR-related questions. This distant relationship is quite different from my previous experiences where I had open and frequent communication with my bosses.\n I've also noticed that the majority of my team members are Desi India, which makes me wonder if the lack of communication could be attributed to cultural differences. I stated this because I had a manager who was Desi India at my last company for month and he never attend stand up and left everything to the tech lead before he was replaced replace.\n Despite expressing my concerns during a 1-1 meeting with my tech lead after three months on the job, little has changed. While I was reassured that I was doing a good job, it's difficult for me to understand how that assessment is made when there's minimal interaction or feedback. Additionally, I've observed discrepancies in the level of support provided to different team members, which is concerning and leads me to question my role within the team.\n When I participate in stand-ups or lead meetings, it often feels like my contributions are overlooked or ignored. As an African American engineer, I can't help but wonder if I've been hired for diversity reasons rather than for my engineering skills. This realization is disheartening and leaves me feeling undervalued and frustrated.\n I turned down other job opportunities earlier this year because I wanted to commit to this the commit for at least 6 months but the current situation has left me questioning that decision.

          "description": "Looking for some outside perspective on a situation that arose at my job. I’ve been working for ~3 years at a company with a small (6 person) Dev team. We have 3 tech stacks and 2 people per stack for redundancy. I’ve got 15yoe overall.\n We’ve never had an on-call chart despite the rest of the larger IT team having one, my job description says “occasional nights and weekends”. I do, however have a company provided cell phone I leave in another room at night.\n Last week there was a network outage impacting our applications and leadership struggled to get anyone on the phone from Dev to help out at 3am.\n The next day leadership declared that the expectation for us was now that we have to be available 24/7 and able to get to our tools quickly unless we were on PTO.\n I was livid so didn’t ask any follow-ups, nor did the rest of my team. I’ve already started polishing my resume but really have enjoyed my job up until this moment. But, I have 2 toddlers and place tremendous value on my personal time and sleep isn’t always a guarantee.\n I’m left wondering, what does this mean if I plan to hike or camp with out internet? What does this mean if I have a few beers? What if I’m driving out of state to visit family? I refuse to clear these types of things with my job.\n Does anyone have any experience as a Dev with this type of demand for availability? I’m at 15yoe and never had this. This policy isn’t covered in the employee handbook either.\n I plan on fighting this - curious how you all would go about it, what questions you would ask, would reach out to HR?\n    submitted by    /u/PowPowPowerCrystal  \n [link]   [comments]",

I work on infrastructure and automation for my team in a niche industry and was hired about a year ago to design a tool for data ingestion that takes some documenation and manual test procedures, parses them into a database, and automates them. \n Over the last year I implemented most of the functionality, did some A/B testing, collected user stories, and got feedback from the other devs, etc. Things seem to be going over well.\n But last month we get a new dev from another team, two years out of college. He is smart and capable, but seems to be out to prove something. Unprompted by anyone he decides my implementation is shit, refactors half of it, and glues on a new front end. He makes a proposal to my manager who accepts the changes, and spends half the presentation just shitting on my work (without ever having spoken to me about any of it or seemingly aware that I was sitting right next to him).\n Granted his work itself is not bad and it addressed some pain points, but I was pissed at the unprompted changing of half the codebase that made half the docs and tests obsolete. He is getting alot of credit for my work as well as the core infrastructure still runs on my code, but the rest of the team seems to have forgotten about it. The only reason he could refactor anything is because I solved the technical challenges first. I was finally about to move on from this project, but now have to play catch up on all the technical debt he made. The way he made the proposal really got on my nerves too. \n Am I being too precious about my code? How am I supposed to react to this? I dont think he conciously meant to step on anyones toes and was just tunnel visioned on making improvements as engineers tend to do, but just the way he did all this without building any trust in his team first really rubbed me the wrong way.

He has superb communication skills, so despite the size of his contributions, he always manages to get recognition from stake-holders, this wasn't the culture of my previous team, on which we were low profile and respected the ownership and expertise of other members.\n This new culture has become a bit uncomfortable as I'm not used to fight my way to lead the few projects available. One reason for this zero-sum battle with senior eng is that eng manager hasn't been that involved in team ops for months, skipping many stand-ups and 1-1s, but this hasn't caused noise to skip-manager & PM, as the team delivers anyways on those few projects.\n Part of me says that I should be happy with the light work load I'm getting here & be more focused in up-skilling while I can.

Looking back, I think this might be because I wasn't as strong in answering random coding trivia questions during interviews.\n However, I'm finally happy to be in a position that involves more technical work. It's primarily focused on simple scripting and (linux/cloud) system administration tasks. While these are valuable skills, I still feel a strong desire to be more deeply involved in the technical aspects of software development (or cybersecurity if there is a decent amount of coding involved).\n So, my question is: Is it normal to crave a more technical role, even after several years in the workforce? Does my experience so far sound like a waste of time, or can the skills I've gained be applied to more technical positions?\n Adding on to this, what I'm noticing is that when I do apply to more technical roles now (although not a crazy amount), I seem to be getting rejected with no interview, which is what scares me.

It is evident that clients get confused, but everyone is polite and just lets him talk.\n Have you had experience with dealing with people like this. How do you provide feedback so it doesn’t sound accusatory. I don’t feel comfortable with providing feedback out of the blue as he doesn’t report to me. Perhaps I shouldn’t care about it in the first place, but I do find this behaviour irritating \n In the next feedback cycle I will write a feedback saying that this person would benefit from learning how to be more concise in the meetings.

I am mid level but not senior yet and now considering leaving/ dialing it back.\n I'm applying aggressively, I know the job market is hard. But I had some health stuff arise and have saved a cushion to land on.\n I'm wondering how common this is for other folks? And for more context: I don't code in my role, I love programming. I want to go back to programming and making cool things/ having pride in my work and ownership in the things I work on. I am more like high level analysis. \n If you left a toxic job-which did not respect boundaries or time off for no real reason- what did you do after? What did you learn from it and what advice would you give someone trying to stick it out in such a hard job market right now? \n Thanks! \n    submitted by    /u/Professional-Pair-99  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also, test that an existing system (old version) can be upgraded with the latest version of your infra-code.\n But those deployments can take a long time.

Simple feature work is hamstrung by the hell I have to go through to get anything working locally, which is infuriating because by the time I have a testing env setup stuff is usually trivial.

          "description": "Ever since AI has hit the scene, we have been having issues where developers blame mistakes they are making on the AI generating the wrong code.\n I have people saying \"oh well chatgpt generated it wrong\" when a bug reaches prod instead of being accountable to their own work. And they can't debug their own work because they don't understand how it works either, so I have to troubleshoot it as well.\n Another issue I have is during code reviews, people cannot explain why they wrote their code a certain way. They just say \"that's what chatgpt output\". And it's usually just several long functions with minimal thought going into the design or how it will work in the bigger picture. One project is using 3 or 4 different libraries for making http requests at this point because chatgpt isn't consistent in which it uses and devs arent checking to see what is already in place. \n The other thing people started doing is responding with a copy paste from chatgpt explaining the design when answering my PR comments. Even if the explanation feels nonsensical from my perspective, they just copy paste spam clearly generated replies until I give up and pass the review over to someone else.\n Ive talked to my boss but hes drunk on AI hype and thinks this is the future. I explain these issues but he thinks I am just trying to force people into doing things the old way. His favorite thing to say is that people originally opposed using compilers and wanted to hand write assembly for a long time, which i find pretty annoying.

Hopefully, based on the upvotes, this is fine :) \n I have finally read all the responses in that thread about the tips for writing better code. A lot of people mentioned testing, but the opinions themselves were really different. \n My recent project proved to me that unit tests are very tricky to get right. It's very simple to write them and increase the coveted code coverage so that fellow devs can applaud and be confident that something good is happening. That said, a lot of tests are either meaningless in that they pass whatever what, or so flaky that maintaining them becomes such a burden that you just want to delete them. \n Recently, it has happened several times that I just ditched all unit tests and mocks and fired testcontainers with a real PG instance. \n Of course, unit tests have their place for business logic where no external dependencies are involved. In such cases, it also helps to use fuzzy testing and property-based testing. \n Now I am rereading the wonderful article by Fowler on tests, but I am sure some of you might have a lot of insightful things to say on the topic.\n    submitted by    /u/dondraper36  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the requests I receive on Fiverr tend to be very ambitious that usually require a team of people to work on them instead of just one person, which usually leads to me declining and explaining that I'm unable to make something like that in a reasonable timeframe as one man. I also separately have in my description that I only make prototypes, so they generally don't include finished environments or animations (unless it's crucial for the prototype or if it helps to visualize the functionality better). Still, I get a ton of requests via dms to make almost a full game with animations, environments, and even some triple A game mechanics, which tends to take too much time or is too ambitious for what's reasonable for an indie developer. I generally try to limit the time I spend on a single order to 1-3 weeks depending on how complex it is but a lot of the requests I get would take at least a few months to make if I only were to focus on that specific order which is impossible since I tend to have other orders I'm working on at the same time. I'm just here to complain because it tends to get frustrating at times since these types of requests seem to be almost half of the dms I receive on Fiverr. Can other freelancers here relate and how do you deal with it?\n    submitted by    /u/Global-Notice-7707  \n [link]   [comments]",

In half a year, learn the hardship of being a woman in a class dominated by men and now i wonder will it always be this way?\n In my own class rooms I don’t feel safe, men have harassed me, a guy got close to me face to face wise and put his hand down his pants to you know where while keeping eye contact with me. I had men who I’m supposed to work with on projects leave me out and call me a “sim player.” (Reference to girls only playing the sims) I had men get angry at me when I help them with there coding or nodes. I been followed and insulted, I been cat called by classmates too. Now it’s not just the men but also the woman too, as a woman who likes coding, video games, etc. it was kinda difficult to find other female friend who liked what I liked, but now I’m too scared to talk to any of them. I had girl say she doesn’t like girly girly with purses, meaning me bc I like my purse (it has a corgi on it)on the first day she was boasting about how she the only woman in a class of men, I have short hair plus I want keeping to myself at the time, but she said that she was happy she was the only woman because other woman are too girly for her, when the professor pointed me out, let’s just say the death glare was definitely felt. I had girls that dismiss me and try to talk over me. and girls who see me as competition in the class and try to one up me on stuff.\n I have heard stories of woman in the industry having problems with getting jobs, coworkers, and work. I won’t lie I thought it never happen to me and that I’ll make friends with my peers but I was wrong.

Lately I've seen a huge rise in \"How to escape tutorial hell videos\" and while at first it made me feel better by helping me identify the situation I was in, after seen like 10+ videos I've gotten on my recommended over time to see what other tips people might have , they all pretty much say the same thing which is mostly \"just stop an make something yourself\" or how to \"watch tutorials effectively\", which seems a bit unfair when you're still at square 1 not knowing what you don't know you need to learn.\n So as said in the title, what does it mean to leave tutorial hell?\n Is it to never gaze your eyes upon a piece of gamedev content and just sit down, open unity and visual studio and pull out Eric Legyen's Foundations of game engine development volume 1 out my butt?\n Or is it to plan out the 27 part how to make an RPG playlist by myself and just look up things as I encounter them like \"okay so I need to move the player character in 4 directions\" or \"hmm.. I wonder how I can subtract health using a sort of trigger?\"and then look it up learning those pieces of information bit by bit as you need them?\n Sorry for the long rant, I've been holding this in for a while now, thanks a lot if you took the time to read and respond.\n    submitted by    /u/Aiden2959  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's not just because there are more games released each year, it's also because of a new Steam appeal system. Before this system, you needed to register in February to be able to participate in June. Now, you can pretty much decide to participate whenever you want and you'll most likely be accepted.\n But there is more to that, and it's far more concerning. Some popular games gets to participate twice while Steam says it's ONE Next Fest (ever).\n I'll take the example of Aloft, a game currently taking of the top slots of Next Fest.\n Well, guess what? Aloft was already participating in June 2022 edition! Here is proof:\n https://youtu.be/LeJyt79sBQU?si=ZZ…",

Especially in certain genres like action rpgs for example, I want to see the skill tree, what classes are available, their abilities, cool effects on weapons and equipment, but instead of dedicating even a single screenshot to one of the game's systems, it's only art.\n Are studios afraid of pushing away players who might be intimidated by these things? And if so why cater to the people who are more likely to refund and write a bad review once they realize they don't like the systems that were kept hidden from them rather than fans of their game's genre who would actually enjoy the systems if they knew about them? There are so many games I skip by that could be perfect for me but I don't want to spend time doing extra research and looking through a gameplay vid on youtube.\n Edit: I do recognize skill trees were a bad example and the complexity there could turn players away, but I am more referring to showing any core system the game has to offer beyond art style and cinematography\n    submitted by    /u/CzechMateQQ  \n [link]   [comments]",

In 2021 I started a game studio with my friend from university and we released our first game in 2022. Most of the funding for our development came from various grants and out of our own pockets. We thought that maybe some publishers or investors would be interested in our next game, but right now, as you might know, the industry is struggling and most studios have to figure out how to stay afloat and don't want to take any chances.\n Now we're about to release and self-publish our second title this July, but we don't have the numbers we wanted. Our biggest hope was Steam Next Fest, but with over 2000 other games attending right now, the chances of our game getting much attention aren't great... Our numbers for our game are around 3500 wishlists before Steam Next Fest, which doesn't seem like much, but it was a lot of work to get there, especially without a viral video or much marketing experience. Maybe there is someone out there who can relate to this situation and have some advice or words of encouragement because we could really use some right now.\n I will attach some graphs and a link to the game for context in the comments.\n    submitted by    /u/Yellik1307  \n [link]   [comments]",

To parallel that, I want to put stuff in my game with the primary purpose of it never being found. These things wouldn’t have sort of huge lore relevance, nor would they be required to find in order to beat the game. They would just be there to deepen the theme of the unknown. I wouldn’t be surprised if players found some of them, but my goal is to make it impossible to find every secret within the game.\n I completely understand that putting something completely functional in a game that isn’t like developer-tools related is arguably bad game design and really weird to do, but I think i would be thematically fitting.\n My biggest question is well, how do I hide it? There are dataminers out there, and i feel like just datamining all of the secrets would sort of ruin the point im trying to come across. I understand it’s impossible to hold back dataminers forever but I definitely want to make the secrets nearly impossible to find within the code, and maybe just make it frustrating overall to datamine. I understand that the chances of someone datamining a game is relatively low, but once again, don’t want these things to be found, or at least not easy to find.\n The obvious answer would just be to not put it in the game entirely, but i still want these things to be theoretically achievable just so cryptic it is nigh impossible.

It would be fun to spend time/know people that share the hobby/interest of developing games. \n How do you do it?\n    submitted by    /u/Tom-Dom-bom  \n [link]   [comments]",

(It runs fine on my computer). Is there a setting in my visual studio to turn that off? Does windows not like the raw .EXE? It's a simple game that's written in C with Allegro. It's only a single statically linked .exe. The game itself is a \"work toy\" like a fidget spinner you have at your desk at work. It's a little micro RPG that plays itself, but you can poke at it when you are bored. The idea is you can play from anywhere-- I even included a \"boss key\" like in the old days that turns it into a little digital clock.. Do I really have to wrap it in an installer or something to make it secure? I really don't want to do that as I would like to keep it so you can run it from anywhere.

We're trying to get a larger audience for our next game, and I've been considering streaming and doing YouTube, but the issue is really that the games are intended for an adult audience, so naturally my reach is very limited. How have other devs of adult games managed to still gain some traction despite this?\n Naturally, places like Twitch and YouTube would be a good start, but I'm not sure that the effort I put into there will automatically be kneecapped and shadow-banned, even if the content is not necessarily explicit. I might even just be barking up the wrong tree, or maybe I'm just not in the right social spaces where I would market this kind of game. Any advice would be really helpful.

Additionally, if the in-game crafting recipe uses household ingredients (the game is set in a city), is that potentially more legal trouble I could be inviting?\n If someone plays my game, then later creates that dangerous material for real, am I possibly culpable for them doing that, and if so do I need to purposefully obscure the references to real-world materials or even have unrealistic/fictional materials instead?\n Regardless of answers given, I aknowledge that none of the comments provided here qualify as legal counsel.\n    submitted by    /u/CenatoryDerodidymus  \n [link]   [comments]",

That's a time savings of 13%, or a speed increase of 15%. \n I've compiled a lot of games over the years. It always brings all cores up to a full 100% workload for almost the whole process no matter the engine. I've always suspected that, in those cases, hyperthreading might actually be slowing my computer down since it isn't needed if the cores are truly at 100% anyway, and that the computational and thermal overhead produced by hyperthreading isn't necessary in those situations. I never got around to testing it because, honestly, I figured I was probably wrong.\n I finally tested it yesterday. I have a fairly large game project in GameMaker. I cleaned and built it four times with hyperthreading still on and the average time was 4:36 (all were close). I then disabled hyperthreading in my bios and tested four more times. The average was 4:00 flat.\n This is with the following system:\n i7-12700k\n 32 GB DDR4 3200\n WD_BLACK SN850 NVMe SSD\n I suspect other engines would also see a speed increase. Since compile times are a huge part of the game dev process, you might want to test the same thing using a project with your computer/engine. Even a 15% speed increase can add up, and it's free.\n    submitted by    /u/TimPrice2  \n [link]   [comments]",

By 2015 I’d visit this sub regularly, mainly for marketing tips. “Top 10 ways to market your indie game” type posts were my favourite.\n We launched into Early Access in December 2017 out of the long defunct Steam Greenlight programme with 18,000 wishlists. That was enough to get us to the big carousel on the front page of Steam at the time. Everything’s very different now. There are more games, better tools, so many more freely available resources like tutorials, and indies generally seem way more marketing savvy. I’m quite relieved we got in there when we did though, I think we’d struggle a lot more starting out now. It definitely still looks possible though; I’m looking forward to the next project.\n I just wanted to say thanks for the help. This sub is a great source of information, and reassurance when things aren’t going quite to plan.\n There's a little post here about how we almost didn't make the game, banging our head against the kickstarter: https://imgur.com/gallery/fArGK7j\n    submitted by    /u/LiamSlugdisco  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd assume many here has read that article.\n To sum it up for those who haven't: the moment a game gets 10 reviews, it not only gets an \"official score\" (like \"Mostly positive\" or \"Mixed\") but also gets WAY more visibility on Steam for a few days.\n Now, one thing that isn't mentioned in the above article is if the \"10 review-effect\" is also happening when the game has already been around for a long time (like mine).\n Another gamedev told me that their game didn't get any noticeable increase in traffic when, after one year, they got their tenth review by a paying customer.\n So, I was wondering: has any small-scale dev here been in my situation, waiting for that tenth review, hoping for a boost in traffic, and then getting it/not getting it?

I'd like to give the experience I had with the system after approximately two weeks of running my own playtest through steam.\n To Start\n On around May 22nd, I put up my game on Steam Playtest.

I definitely learned a ton from the process. I built my own framework in JavaScript + React + Electron, which is something I haven't done before. I learned how to integrate into Steam and build something from start to finish (which is something I REALLY struggled with). \n I know everyone loves numbers, so I wanted to provide a few for those who find it interesting. To date, I've sold about 4,400 copies of my game, with currently 4K wishlists. That's about $13.4K in gross revenue and about $9380 is what I see of that.

One in perticular that still makes me chuckle is telling us we'd failed as game devs because we insisted we should include a mouse sensitivity slider for our game. We were told that the mouse sensitivity should be perfect! and no one should have any need to adjust their mouse sensitity for the game.\n We had to explain that people prefer different mouse sensitivities and not one setting fits everyone. We had a perfect example among our dev team. Me using a edpi of around 2400 and another developer using a edpi of around 400. Needless to say we were never allowed to add a mouse sensitivity slider because according to that senior staff member we were wrong in thinking we needed one. The company is now closed down.\n In general it was like they hated the idea of giving the player any way of changing anything in options, and this is only one example.

This is Steam's auto conversion which they recommend. I suppose this is a Vietnamese thing, but still so strange to see literally no one buy it when the youtuber is having a great time.\n Edit: As a commentor said, Steam is currently banned in Vietnam.

Do a playable prototype using most basic 2d or 3d shapes. Gameplay first. There are some exceptions, but this approach wouldn't hurt them either.\n Make sure the prototype you've made is good enough to reflect your desired gameplay on 80-90%.\n After - look at your prototype with a very new look, and think once again of the MOST simple art style that could represent your idea \"well enough\". Replace simple shapes with some assets. Don't be afraid of using Assetstore or other places to buy/get your assets if they fit. No-one really cares about their originality as long if it fits and it's fun.\n Register pages for all important social media the day you start. Post everything you do there, start getting some followers. Remember, making a game is always much longer process then you expect, the game you want to make in 2 weeks may take 2 month, may take 2 years. Before you finish - you'll have some audience to start with. If you start late - you will regret not starting at once. It will take months of daily posting just to make it a habit, so it's much better to start at day 1.\n The hardest thing in making a game is 'completing and releasing' it. Make this your main goal and priority. Everything else goes second.\n  \np.s. This strategy works not only for the 1st game, but I'd stick to it in general.

Taking classes and doing whatever I can to get ahead and learn new things. I became a UI Artist, UX designer after spending 10 years doing graphic design. I picked up character art and took classes because I enjoyed 3D work. And eventually made the leap to doing UI in games. ( Mostly Unity ).\n And it dawned on me ( a few times ). That the amount of effort it takes to get a job. The amount of effort it takes to keep up with new software. The endless art test that dont go anywhere. And for what? A Job that MIGHT last for 2-3 years? Fighting for $80-$90k a year?\n I feel like I wasted my life whenever I compare myself to my friends. An example is my friend Mel. She does \"Territory Development\". And she makes $100k plus commission + Bonus of $17k+. So, she easily makes $200k a year in Texas. She never has to spend a moment outside of work studying for anything. She doesnt have to fight for work or do all that crap we do. And the worst part is she tells me how she just manages a few clients, answers questions and offers them suggestions for building stuff. And the company she works with has a team that does the rest. She gets to travel, never has to worry about not having healthcare. Can easily afford her new $400k Home. ( we arent talking Cali or NY big city numbers either ). \n Being 36, im just tired of not being able to have the confidence to buy a home because I cant figure out if the damn publisher is going to lay us all off. Or how many months I have to save for because I know I will be unemployed and that is the closest I will get to a vacation because im too worried about being laid off during my PTO.

I need to know whether the art is AI or not because submitting AI art can get me in trouble with certain platform holders, especially if I don't disclose it on the AI survey form which is required for game submissions.

          "description": "I recently stumbled upon a Reddit post where someone was struggling to come up with a name for their game. It got me thinking about our own journey to naming “Castle of Blackwater” and the memories came flooding back. Naming a game is no small feat, and it was quite challange for us too. \n We knew from the start that we wanted to create a social deduction game. During the Christmas holiday, I traveled to Spain and spent some time working on different concepts. I explored a few ideas: one had a medieval theme, another was more temple-like, and the last concept revolved around a magical castle. The magical castle vibe resonated with us, so I immediately started writing the backstory and drafted the first two chapters. It was during this process that I envisioned a magical river with black water, which became a key element in the lore. \n After returning from my trip, I sat down with my co-founder to brainstorm the name. This process took quite a while. We thought “Blackwater” sounded catchy and had a certain allure and mystery to it. Our first idea was “Battle of Blackwater,” but a quick Google search led us straight to a Game of Thrones episode. Clearly, we couldn’t use that. \n Finally, we landed on “Castle of Blackwater,” and it just felt right. It’s been quite some time since then, and now we’re gearing up for our Steam launch at the end of 2024. It’s funny to think back on those days and see how far we’ve come. \n Now, I’m curious how did you come up with the name for your game or username? Or maybe you have a funny story about how you created your online identity?\n Curious to know!\n    submitted by    /u/Castle_Of_Blackwater  \n [link]   [comments]",

When making hair for stylised characters, I have sculpted the hair in Zbrush and the retopped, however looking at the hair in these games I'm unsure if they have a high poly for the hair or just jump straight to building the low poly. And as a side question, is floating geo common for stylised hair? I've avoided in the past out of inexperience, but looking back on it now I imagine its probably the best way to make sylised hair? And another one on the topic of hair, are hair cards a method purely for creating semi/realistic looking hair similar to xgen?\n sorry if i worded it poorely, a bit tired atm\n TLDR looking for suggestions/ideas for how the hair is modelled for characters in these games \n    submitted by    /u/JustARandomWeeb__  \n [link]   [comments]",

After that I crawled back into my cave to work on the game and forgot about marketing.\n Since I enjoy numbers and statistics, I decided to try reach the magic wishlists mark with paid advertising, mostly on Reddit but also some Twitter and Facebook. The goal was to receive the blessings of the Steam algorithm at launch by getting on Popular Upcoming so I was fine if the strategy lost a bit of money per wishlist.\n Here is my game for some context.

We tried to develop two different projects, but the projects never saw the light of day because there were problems with project and team management. About 2 weeks ago, I started treatment for 3 hernias in my lower back, during this process, the doctor told me that I shouldn't sit for too long, but I still tried to close the deficiencies in the project. And this morning I learned that I was fired from work with a phone call. I'm not angry about being fired, but I'm angry that the project I worked on was taken away from me, I was suddenly removed from the organisation on github, I was kicked out of the discord server, there are really very bad people in this world. By the way, although my main job is Game play programmer, I was also working in 3d modelling, animation and texturing to cover the deficits in the company.

          "description": "(Unsure if this is the correct flair)\n After having built a 3D bullet hell in GDScript, spending almost as much time doing optimizations as I spent on programming the prototype, and now building a similar prototype in C# using the physics / rendering server...I can't think of any reason to NOT statically type your GDScript code.\n Static typing not only makes it significantly easier to debug but has notable performance boosts across the board. As someone who comes from a Java/C++ background, I also personally feel it brings *a bit* more professional credibility to GDScript as a language.\n I did a side-by-side optimization comparison test that directly accesses the Physics/Rendering 3D server to create 3000 bullets in GDScript and C#. Statically typed GDScript was only about 10% FPS slower than the C# version.\n Yet the overwhelming majority of YouTube tutorials and code posted on this subreddit use dynamically typed GDScript. Any particular reason why static typing isn't the default when it only appears to have benefits over dynamically typed GDScript?\n Curious on everyone's thoughts - for those programming in GDScript , do you enforce static typing in your code?\n UPDATE:\n Thanks to everyone for your input and insight! Didn't realize the subject of static typing was so polarizing.\n For anyone interested, here is the github link to the optimization test using the PhysicsServer3D and RenderingServer to spawn 3000 objects, written in static typed GDScript:\n https://github.com/vgscreenwriter/Godot-PhysicsServer3D-Test\n Godot version 4.2.2, Jolt3D physics engine\n    submitted by    /u/vgscreenwriter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "10 days ago i released my first game on steam and i always said i want to make 92 Euros with it. Thats exact the amount the Steam page for the game costs me. The game itself did not cost me anything but my time. And game development is my hobby. So everything is fine and i dont want to get rich. Seeing others like my game is good enough.\n So, i did not do much marketing activities and got like 50 wishlists in the ~4 weeks between publishing the steam page and releasing the game. So i got a few sales and was very happy. I also got very early 2 positive reviews and the first one was really good and made me proud. It was some youtuber dude wo made a very positive video about it. and i never heard of him before, it was really random and i dont know how he found our about my game. Did i tell you, i was proud and happy? :) i was sure, the 92 Euros would not be a problem and i already had 12 sales :D\n Yeah, no problem. Everything is nice...\n Until the refunding start and 50% of the sales got refunded until now. and every sale maybe is still refundable because of the 14 days refund policy.\n Some refunding players gave reasons like..\n - \"low framerate\": i tested my game on an old potato low budget laptop and it worked absolutely smooth on that thing that was 5 years ago the cheapest windows laptop on the market, no joke! Even my mothers low budget smarphone runs it at an acceptable speed.\n - \"game does not match screenshots and trailer\": i dont get that. the trailer shows in every second 100% recorded gameplay and also the screenshots are real screenshots.\n Thats a little bit frustrating. Do you other game devs have made similar experiences?\n i know my game makes more fun when played with/against humans, but thats an hen and egg problem..\n If you want to have a look, my game is called \"Pyradice\". https://store.steampowered.com/app/2957200/Pyradice/\n    submitted by    /u/PristineBobcat9608  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "It's an infinite loop: you crave making a game, you start developing something, you get bored or burnt out, you stop. I was really enjoying the process, I like making games and I like using Godot, but then yet again I stopped. This time I reflected a bit and I understood why it happened. Apparently I don't have a clear goal. I start to think about \"why should I make this game, there are thousands better than mine\". I make games since I was 14 (now I'm 32) and when I was younger it was very easy for me working consistently to a game, indeed I released several games. The simple \"I just want to make a game because yes\" worked at that time. Now it doesn't work anymore and the lack of a reason, something to achieve for having developed a game makes me lose the direction and the beauty of creating something. Does it happens to you too? Should I simply give up making games? (I can't, after some times I inevitably come back making games 🫤) Do you have any suggestion?\n    submitted by    /u/fuck---spez  \n [link]   [comments]",

We’re aiming to maintain the compatibility with the existing community-driven plugin. Last but not least, the Godot support plugin is set to be bundled with Rider in the 2024.2 release.\n  \nThis is fantastic news, and more proof that Godot is well on the way to being acknowledged as a first class engine alongside the usual Unity & Unreal duo.\n PS: Jetbrains IDE are paid software but the EAP (early access program) will allow you to use the early access version for free!

Those numbers are 100% from my own \"marketing\" efforts. There are people way better at this than me! I'm just sharing my experience here and I'll let you judge if it's helpful. Some things that did not work with me might work with others (and vice versa)! You can also read all of this in my free patreon post.\n Wishlist Graph\n Let's sort what worked out the best for m…",

I know little to nothing about how to write shaders but i think that it detects the edges of objects, selects some points with a set distance from each other and draws a straight line between them. I am not sure if it works like that but that's my best guess.\n Anyways, i would like other people to share their thoughts on this and some insight on where i could learn to write shaders. I will take a look at the docs in the meanwhile.\n    submitted by    /u/Glebzard  \n [link]   [comments]",

Keep in mind that I have no access to the target, then I can't reboot ot, or call a shared file, or anything else. And there is nobody working since it's a lab. I want to get the hash with no \"human\" action from the target.\n Please what do you advice ? MITM6 ? anything else ?\n I was wondering if scans as Nessus and Nmap would simulate some traffic from those particular ports, since it works like a handshake, the answers would generate something ?\n For example an SMB scan, would give some data back to the attacker and generate a hash ?\n And what y'all think about launching mitm6, ntlmrelayx, and responder at the same time ?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Known_Personality_80  \n [link]   [comments]",

I stumbled upon it very randomly and it would be a super easy fix for them. They became known from going viral on social medias like tiktok and youtube, have 5M-8M users and from a very unofficial source they have a net worth of $20M. I have no idea if they would give out a bounty and I won’t give it out if it’s way too low/none.

I live in the United States and see my therapist virtually through a service called Thriveworks. 3 months is a long time and I am going to be visiting family while I am there, and it's likely to be a very stressful trip as a result. My therapist told me he could, in the worst case scenario, lose his license if he were to do a session with me while I was abroad. However, he suggested that I use a VPN and said he'd still meet with me for virtual sessions like normal, which is once a week. \n Is there anything to worry about realistically, from an information security standpoint?

Also, just to tick off the obvious:\n  \nNo chrome tabs were open that could be playing ads or videos.\n No background apps.\n No games open.\n No open remote desktop sessions.\n No signal/skype/teams or anything of the sort.\n No, I'm not hearing voices in my head, they were 100% coming from the PC. I live in a 4th floor apartment with good ventilation, and do not have any sources of carbon monoxide that I can think of.\n  \nMy speakers are somewhat high end MTMs so I assume they should not be picking up any random interference, but suppose this could not be ruled out entirely?\n None of the malware scans picked up anything.\n What else to check?

They were made a local admin by a group policy applied to all end-user workstations \n So you are ready to take over the network, except...\n \n The same group policy also gives them \"Deny access to this computer from the network\" everywhere. \n So you can't move laterally with just this account, but maybe you're going to harvest their password to at least elevate on other workstations you have a non-elevated foothold on?\n \n No password was used; smart card is required for interactive logon. \n But maybe you can do something with their NTLM secret at least?\n \n They are in the \"Protected Users\" group and cannot authenticate with NTLM.\n  \nThe best I can think of is you might be able to steal their PIN out of the LSA if credential guard is not enabled, and maybe whip up some custom method of proxying the smart card to another host, but that might be tough to implement given that the account's only value is local admin and if you can install a tampered smartcard driver on the destination machine, you were already local admin.\n Am I missing something? I only ask because many people have said the only fully safe way for a technician to be able to elevate to local admin on an end-user device is by looking up and typing a complex LAPS password, and if that's true, this alternative (a smart card with a dedicated in-person-only admin account) must be broken somehow.\n    submitted by    /u/PowerShellGenius  \n [link]   [comments]",

He paid with his debit card and left. And he’s now saying that there’s been £3-5 taken out each day since, and £100 that was blocked by the bank. Surely this isn’t possible? Google didn’t come up with much no matter how I phrased it, just gave results for online stores.\n I have reasons to be suspicious about his spending, so just wondering if it’s another cover up.\n Edit: this was the UK, no credit card, paid with contactless.

I called Spectrum and they gave me a Mac address for the main unknown device which was coming from a Belkin_ext router. What I noticed:\n My wifi signal (MINE) and the signal for Belkin_ext were the same strength as I walked around the property. \n When I looked at the belkin_ext router info on the wifi settings list, the Mac address was the same for the mystery devices that had been previously connected. They matched. This is new to the apartment and mine is close to the office. \n I blocked new devices from entering and changed my password and name. Then 3 devices were blocked from connecting (apple and Lenovo pc). \n This whole thing started when I reported illegal activity in the complex to the property manager (Charged with ID THEFT but didn't jail time). \n I suspect cameras or bugs, and an RF detector picked up from only one outlet. But I cant find anything in there when pulled out...\n I am really stumped how I can prove this. Does anyone have advice? She has a personal vendetta against me for no valid reason. I'd love some of your help in making sure I take correct measures to police. And making sure it's HER. I can't see her router but maybe I can see something on the public lounge computer. \n Thank you!!!\n    submitted by    /u/Planit4Squad  \n [link]   [comments]",

For an assignment I have a list of password hashes along with a hint of what they could be. In this case the first set of passwords are a kaiju followed by three digits and a single lowercase letter with an MD5 hash applied to them. The second set off passwords are a basic color (think crayola basic 12 set teachers words not mine) followed by a kaiju name and these are a SHA-1 hash. I was able to get one password from the first set and I was able to get 4 passwords from the second set. l've been coming up with wordlist after wordlist but nothing else has cracked and l've been wracking my brain for the past 3 days. If anyone is willing to offer some advice it would be hugely appreciated. Also l've been using hash-identifier, hashcat, as well as Johnny for this assignment, and I think l've got the basics down for how they work\n    submitted by    /u/Starthelegend  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hospitals in London have had to cancel cancer operations this week because of a Russian cyber-attack that continues to cause serious disruption to NHS services in the capital.\n  \nCancer surgeries delayed: St Thomas’ and King’s College hospitals have been forced to postpone cancer operations due to the cyberattack. This critical delay is because the attack crippled their ability to provide blood transfusions, a vital procedure during many cancer surgeries.\n Widespread disruption across NHS services: The attack goes beyond these two major hospitals. It's impacting six NHS trusts and dozens of GP practices in southeast London, affecting millions of people's care. This disruption includes cancelled appointments and likely extends beyond just blood-related procedures.\n Lack of transparency causing unease: While NHS England acknowledges the attack and its impact, they haven't released details on the number of cancelled operations, including critical procedures like transplants. This lack of transparency is causing frustration and unease among both staff and likely patients who are unsure about the status of their appointments.\n  \nDr Chris Streather, the medical director for NHS England’s London region, said : “We are sorry to all those who have been impacted and staff will work hard to re-arrange appointments and treatments as quickly as possible.”\n Source (The Guardian)\n    submitted by    /u/Used-Bat3441  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I have some labs to finish for my certification training. Lab are in a localhost environment. Course is about WEB vulns, and I need to use BurpSuite and FoxyProxy.\n When both Foxy and burp are on, and the intercept on, pages won't load. The thing is that everything is correctly configured, like 127.0.0.1 port 8080, no exceptions on both Foxy/Burp. CA Port Swigger Certificate in place.\n But pages won't load, or they will load without interception. The worse thing is that my localhost page refuses to load when Foxy and Intercept are functioning, because my Labs are on localhost page, and I can't even have access to my labs.\n I tried and configured everything possible, I even changed ports to try. I also tried on seceral browsers : same thing. I updated/upgraded, restarted. Nothing. Tried with BurpSuite's built-in browser (Chromium) : same.\n I'm stuck for 1 (full) day and can't fin a solution. I always had some trouble with Foxy/Burp in the past except 1 time where it worked fine.\n I need to keep the intercept on because it's a part of my labs.\n Worse, when I decide to put the intercep off and stop foxy I have to restart my VM to get internet functioning.\n I can't work on my very last labs, and I'm afraid about my cert exam.\n Please do you have a solution ? An alternative ?\n    submitted by    /u/Known_Personality_80  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n I hope this is ok to post. I am a penetration tester, and I have a specific requirement right now for my job. My team is currently doing security-requirement evaluation, and there is a requirement that talks about performing HTTP fuzzing on a device that does not act as a server; it is a bad requirement essentially.\n There is some belief within the team that we could try to fuzz one of the shared libraries (.so) that handles some of the lower-level HTTP logic, but it does not house code that is used for routing or anything like that.\n Personally, I'm not convinced that such a fuzzing tool even exists for this type of use case, but I want to make sure I cover my bases before discussing again within the team. I've spent ample time researching, and could not find anything pertinent.\n My question is, does anyone have any knowledge of such a tool? The use case is specifically HTTP binary fuzzing; not HTTP server fuzzing, and not general binary fuzzing.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Jackscalibur  \n [link]   [comments]",

We could reassemble and enter anything into the serial and had a full working software. Oh, them days was fun. Then the software programmers became smarter and they started checking for the disassembler. A ugly prompt would open up saying the disassembler software being used could not be used. I was sad.

          "description": "I need some help here. Basically I've found that one of the biggest wifi providers in my country uses a combination of a set prefix and the last few letters of the wifi name as a default password. I think that's still okay AS LONG AS THEY TELL PEOPLE TO CHANGE IT. I remember when we got our wifi, they just gave us the password and said that that was the one we needed to use. No recommendation to change the password or how we could do so. I had to do it myself once I realised that anyone could easily log into my wifi. Now I've tested this default password on every wifi network of the same provider I've come across. I've connected to around 20 of them and only one had changed their password. This is extremely dangerous because it's a (basically) open port to any wifi(one of the largest providers here btw) that can easily be exploited...\n So are the default passwords similarly set up where you live?\n I'd love to hear from you guys. I can say that as far as I've seen, in europe the passwords are randomly generated.\n Any advice is welcome!\n    submitted by    /u/Obviously_Special  \n [link]   [comments]",

I started with their Linux ctf's(I was first interested in the assembly part but I figured I might need to know Linux first to use it properly) but most of the time I hit roadblocks, not knowing why something doesn't work. I haven't made much progress due to lack of free time and I have constantly struggled. Sometimes I figured on my own but other times I had to look up or ask on their discord. Ever since then I tried looking into other resources. Two days ago I looked into tryhackme and have been enjoying their platform, feel and how they are willing to teach from the absolute beginnings. I intend to buy their premium plan but I want to know what's out there and if maybe HTB academy is a more worth purchase for absolute beginner and dumbass. I am asking this question because I see pwn.college brought up very rarely for all the free content it offers.\n Tl;Dr: I tried using pwn.college for about a month or two, realise I suck, tried tryhackme for a day, enjoyed it and want to know if I should invest in tryhackme with their premium plan to get everything or go to HTB academy and buy their premium plan.

So mods, if you delete this post, I would appreciate anyone letting me know a more appropriate place to post this.\n For background: I initially learned Java 8 years ago and it got me hooked on computer science. I've gone down a traditional path for the most part as I now do back-end IT work focused on cloud migration, though have done a number of ad hoc projects that go beyond that and worked in a more data-analyst-esque position before I ended up in this job 8 months ago. I have professional experience in Python, R, SQL (Redshift, SQL Server, MySQL, and MS Access for whatever that might count for...), VBA, and some familiarity with bash and PowerShell to the extent that I could use the internet to help me automate some recurring processes.\n I discovered ethical hacking recently and I think it's something I want to pursue. But, if I'm being honest, learning this feels pretty daunting and I'm not really sure where to begin (I've got a Linux VM booted up at the very least). \n More or less, I'm looking for someone with experience that I can learn from and get support from. If anyone is interested and wants to chat, I'd be more than happy to compensate with my own hourly wage if it becomes long-term (my hope) .\n Really, I'm just looking for quality resources for a complete beginner because, while I can code, I'm definitely lacking in the knowledge required here.\n    submitted by    /u/BeanPaddle  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not only that, but after the site went live, the business is now asking me to help them with some of their clients websites moving forward so I'm hoping it's consistent work. \n The second is for a Java dev that wants me to build a website that'll host their app they are working on. This will be more in depth and require setting up a database, user creation, authentication, and payment processing. \n I would have never landed these gigs without my friends' connections.

          "description": "Now, I get that many programmers consider SQL to be too simple and noobish to be even considered a programming language. But of all languages, I think SQL stands out as not only one of the easiest to learn and practice, the sheer genius of this language is that it lets you do so much with so little expressiveness, while still trying to maintain standards across various kinds of databases as much as possible.\n With all their expressive tokens and syntaxes, languages like C and Java and Python are often appreciated and rightly so, but I think SQL also deserves a place up there in the list of \"do more with less jargon\" things out there. In fact, the four basic DML/DDL statements (create, insert, update, delete) are all you need to get started with creating tables and manipulating data on most projects. And learning additional features like alter, drop, truncate, etc. is both fun and interesting.\n And once you go even further with things like stored procedure and triggers, the real fun then begins! If you consider the below stored procedure of some hypothetical SQL dialect, it is no less elegant than any of the other popular expressive languages like Python or Ruby, don't you agree?\n create or replace procedure foo: begin select @test = select foo from bar; -- statement 2; -- statement 2; -- statement 3; end; \n    submitted by    /u/pyeri  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll be graduating by this year with a CS degree but I still know nothing about coding.\n I wasn't a good student from the beginning and in the second year I had a mental breakdown after facing so much failure in life and because of that I had a huge drop in the cgpa. I was living alone in the hostel and could't even share anything with my parents. But when I gave up on everything I finally decided to quit my life and finally show my grades to parents before that. It was one of the hardest decisions of my life, and when I showed my grades to my parents I saw my father cry for the first time in life. At that moment, I forgot everything and promised myself I'd become a better student and resettle the things I've done bad.\n Fast forward to 2024, I did become a good student, my grades came up, took studying seriously and gave the exams seriously. But as you all know uni teaching doesn't make you a better programmer so I am still not so much skillful to get a job.\n So, anyone reading this I'd really be so much blessed if you can show me or advice me a lerning path. My goal is to now restart the coding learning from basics, I am considering to start with CS50. Will that be a better choice? I want to learn the basics and master DSA in these few months and trynna enter Leetcode. Would this be a better approach or if you think there is faults in my plan.

          "description": "I recently came to the conclusion that old programming books are better than new ones. This will be preposterous to some and, I suspect, obvious to others. \n Old books are better because those that remain in the public consciousness are certified classics. They have withstood the tests of time, remaining relevant, which means they must have value of some kind. \n This value is two-fold. They either provide technical knowledge that has remained timeless or they provide valuable historical context, and the outdated technical knowledge can be overlooked. \n Historical context is not something that many people look for in programming books, but they should. Understanding the history of an idea helps us understand the idea in greater detail. Particularly, most of the history of computer science was driven by individuals who aimed to solve relevant problems within constraints. By understanding who these individuals were, the problems they were trying to solve, and the constraints they operated within, we are able to better understand the ideas and tools that were developed. \n For example, I would highly recommend The Design and Evolution of C++ by Bjarne Stroustroup. This book teaches history, philosophy, language building, low-level programming, and effective design in the context of C++, covering why and how it was developed. \n When you read old programming books, whether for technical know-how or historical facts, you begin to see that everyone involved was human. Everything in programming makes sense to humans because it was designed by humans. The pioneers who came before, although extremely talented, were humans like you or me, and this is a reassuring thought to remember. \n I would recommend reading old books, especially for beginners. They provide context in a seemingly context-less world and help to make sense of the complexity of programming. \n Hope this helps someone!\n    submitted by    /u/GenghisKharr  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all, so I'm in the pretty early stages of teaching myself web development for a personal creative project, and frankly it's been kind of slow putting the pieces together! I'm old and I got time so my progress is pretty slow. All I want to do eventually is post bloggy type things involving photos, doodles, and some music-y things I'm making. I'm learning completely solo so I don't have classmates to rant to!\n I've ruled out that I need python for now, but I've settled on Internetting is Hard and W3Schools for html/css education. On my own account I tried to download Jekyll because it sounded like it'd be helpful, and it may be, but it got me more familiar with 1) the Terminal, 2) VSCode, 3) Ruby, and 4) Homebrew and all of those things were terrifying to me before. Jekyll is enabling me to kind of see results of learning/tinkering a little faster than what I was doing before.\n Installing Jekyll through Terminal via Homebrew was such a cool learning experience.\n So why am I saying this is kind of a superpower? I'm also learning markdown elsewhere because certain programs like Notenik, Spaces, or Logseq use them, and it's a pretty nifty thing. Those types of programs are just helping me write better notes.\n And it hit me that ALL OF THIS IS JUST TEXT (duh that's what HTML is dude!) and it's just kind of amazing to me that you can build a whole valuable website and automate all sorts of things just by writing stuff out and placing it in the right spots. And the fact that it's just text files means it's super shareable, savable, and open. It's wild.\n Here and in other subreddits folks have been so helpful so I just wanted to write this out, if only for an affirmation. By the end of the summer I'll have a tiny simple stupid website that matches my vision and in April it literally seemed impossible.\n edit:\n this is awesome\n    submitted by    /u/Interesting-Head-841  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got into interview and it went really well i did have some experience/projects in python[Machine learning and Web development] to showcase so like the interviewer is impressed but at last he started telling me that \"so this is a small company this internship will cost you $20[₹1700] for the mentorship we provide. You have to build and give them two projects in 1 month tenure\" - exact words.\n So here i am confused about what to do, at first i thought it is a scam because though this was a unpaid internship i did sign up unwillingly but now they are want me to pay them. EDITED[Added] - 'And the second thought which comes in mind was this can be true because I don't about other countries but whenever I searched on LinkedIn and location in India for the internships there are number of internships which wants me to pay like $5[₹500-₹800]. They are just like distributing internships certificate and the tasks are like make a calculator. That's where i thought it can be real.'\n What are views on this should pay them and start or try another internship?\n Also if you can refer me some good internship, please show your kindness.\n    submitted by    /u/ketan_v_astro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "One thing some people learn before programming is Pseudo Code, which is actually writing the code in your language in sequential steps, then you write that as a code.\n Even though you don’t right it as a code, just writing Pseudo Codes helps you a lot developing the way you think and write your code.\n A simple example:\n You need a program that adds two integers, Pseudo Code will look like something like this:\n  1- Define a variable (x) to store the first Number. 2- Define a variable (y) to store the second Number. 3- Define a variable (sum) to store the sum of the integers. 4- Add the two integers and store them in (sum), which is sum = x + y \n Doing that for more examples will help you think smartly and more logically, then you’re gonna start doing that in your mind automatically without having to write that.\n Yes logic is sometimes frustrating at the beginning, but trust it’s gonna be fun and satisfying later.\n Good luck\n    submitted by    /u/WaseemHH  \n [link]   [comments]",

So this might sound like a good and creative thing but it's actually not, because sometimes when writing code I stop at a situation where I can't write good and clear variables names, other people would just name them something understandable at least and then continue but when I try to do so I start getting anxiety. As if I am having obsessive compulsive disorder over my code to keep it clean.\n Edit: Some people thought that I am trying to code \"clean\" but not \"simple\" code, by talking about this situation it's happening to me for both things.

I have a work history of starting my career in healthcare as a medical assistant and worked for 8 years. Since I am done with school I really want to get into the tech field but I do not know where to start. I have applied internships in the past and last year I got an interview with conEdison about an internship opportunity for computer science but I did not get it. I reached out to other companies but I never got an answer back. So I am just lost and unmotivated. I also have a fear to do interviews now because Im not an expert in programing yet, I dedicated my time doing well in school and doing other subjects in classes that my focus in being a good programmer shifted to just getting work done. I want to have a place in the field because I feel that if I am in a tech working environment, then I will thrive and do more in that aspect of the career. \n I worked on several small projects like database management project, some small python projects, web development (html, css, javascript) when I made a grocery store website. and my latest project was making an android app in regards to finding a visa. So I have some experience but not enough to answer any technical questions such as problem solving and algorithms. But I really want to and I feel like all of that motivation I had faded a little bit. \n After I completed my bachelors and when I also finished my finals I felt so drained that I did not feel like getting up from bed, going out, I could not focus on my planning. so I am very demotivated, but I had some time to rest and reflect, my mind feels bit clear. So I contacted several of my school staff to see where I should go and talk to and hopefully they point me at the right direction. \n In the mean time I want to see some outside help, some opinions and I would appreciate that. thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/jorex5  \n [link]   [comments]",

Enough of partying and enjoying my late 20s, I decided in my 30s, I want to work to improve myself and I want to be better in programming.

Are there any fundamentals or books that I can approach to understand better?\n At work sometimes I feel stupid, but because I have been working for years, I have good people skills and communication skills, and I also understand the system a bit better so I can guide my colleagues, and my juniors and bosses seem to enjoy my company. But I want to be better so that I can lead better, and also guide my juniors. When asked about specific Java topics, sometimes I just don't know the solution and I feel like I don't deserve being a senior.\n I cannot even solve some of the simple LeetCode questions and it's honestly depressing.

As the only female developer in the company, I was scared that I wouldn't fit in, but it was completely the opposite! Three years later, the company is shutting down, and I will soon be out of a job.\n After I started applying for jobs a few months ago, I realized how much I don't know. I can build something, and most of the time I'll find a solution and complete the task, or the app. I felt like I understood most of the things I was working with.\n A few months ago, an interviewer asked me about state management in Angular, and I looked at him like he came from another planet.\n Of course, that didn't go well, and I didn't get a job offer. I decided to ask the team lead at my current job about this question, and he told me that we never really used state management in the apps we were building.\n Not to mention that the latest version we were working with was 12.\n This is all my mistake. Complaining about the amount of work I had to do, or the overtime work would be a bad excuse. Instead of focusing only on the tasks, I should have kept learning in my free time. Now that version 18 is out, I am missing a lot, and I feel so embarrassed. I am scared of applying for jobs now and am even reconsidering working in a coffee shop until I catch up on all the missing concepts we never covered at my soon-to-be ex-company. I should have found a mentor a lot earlier.\n Enough of this.\n To everyone entering the world of programming and learning: don't give up if you're passionate about it.

What is unclear at the moment: * What is a driver actually needed for, what does it do exactly? * Why can a generic driver be enough? Is this similar to protocols like tcp where the application that uses tcp at the end just sens generic tcp segments over the network? * Do drivers expose an API to developers? And how do they do this? Is this a special file I access or a library in a programming language? How does this work? * When I use, let‘s say an USB device from my app, how do I access it? Do I use such an API of the driver (e.g. an USB HID driver)? Must I interpret USB packets / HID reports?\n A concrete example would be greatly appreciated.

          "description": "Comming from data science learning OOP (with C#) is actually not easy for me and I wonder if other people feel the same:\n Want to print \"Hello World\"? You need a class for that. What is a class? A class can instantiate objects and has fields and methods. Ok. What are fields? A field is a Variable of any type that is declared directly inside a class or structure. Fields should not be accessed directly but always through Properties. Ok what the fuck is a property? A property is a member of a class that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field. Huh? Private fields? And then you go from there to accessors, getters setters, encapsulation, Interfaces, abstraction, Abstract classes, delegates, SOLID, KISS, etc. etc.. Compared to, say Python, C# feels like it puts many hurdles purposefully in front of you to execute seemingly easy tasks.\n Or in other words: It feels like watching Harry Potter part 5 without any knowledge of the previous parts. You can appreciate the film for its value but have no clue why things are happening. The level of abstraction in C# if you were to start learning today puts a huge backlog of concepts and things to learn on you.\n More specific: my main gripe at the moment is that it is actually not trivial how to communicate between classes and that I still never know when I need to instantiate an object or not to get the functionality I need. Accessor types are also still a mystery for me in practice although I know everything I need to know in theory.\n In Data science the whole process of writing code is much more sequential and I feel I get more oportunities to actually write the juicy parts where as in C# I am constantly held back by code structure and architecture.\n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/Mafiale  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't see it that way though. \n I took computer studies in school during my first semester, but the teacher I had was boring and made classes very uninteresting. Even though it was an open course, it was obvious that he expected us to know some code, and I knew nothing. His lessons were just written on pdfs, and he expected us to understand. Additionally, I found him to be quite unapproachable when it came to asking for help. All around me were coding geniuses, and I couldn't understand anything. It made the classes hell for me, and overall, it just distanced me from coding.\n A few weeks ago, I started to try to learn again by enrolling in the Harvard CS50 course on EdX. But I can't seem to find time to do it, and again, coding just doesn't seem interesting. Plus, I'm really burned out from school right now. The only motivation I have for coding is its pay. I want to like it and I want to learn, but I can't pick up on anything, and I still haven't developed an interest in it. \n I really needed to get all of this off my chest, as my sister doesn't understand why I don't want to do it, and I'm just really stressed right now with exams coming up and schoolwork in general. \n I really want to know if anybody was in a similar situation. \n Thanks for reading all of this\n    submitted by    /u/yuzzy21  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We're all familiar with the use of 'dd' to write installers, the good old\n sudo dd if=installer.img of=/dev/sda2 bs=1M status=progress \n dance. It works, but it's not great:\n  \nThe progress info doesn't show progress as a percentage, nor does it calculate an ETA, it just shows bytes written.\n dd's default block size is a bad fit for most modern systems, hence the bs= parameter.\n It's easy to forget status=progress, and including it every time is a bit annoying.\n  \nNow, dd doesn't do anything special: it just reads from one file and writes to another. Tools like pv and cat could do the exact same thing. The only reason people really use dd for this purpose is that you can run dd as root, whereas redirecting the output of cat or pv requires running the shell itself as root. sudo dd ... is more terse than sudo sh -c 'cat ...'.\n A few weeks ago, I got annoyed with dd and implemented a --output option to the excellent tool called pv (\"Pipe Viewer\"). This meant that I could write images using sudo pv -o /dev/sda2 ... instead of using dd.\n Well, a week ago, PV released version 1.8.10 which contains my --output feature! Once your distribution updates to the latest version, you too can use pv instead of dd. Here are some advantages:\n  \npv shows an actual progress bar and an ETA, rather than just bytes written.\n pv automatically detects optimal buffer sizes.\n pv is more terse, since there is no need to specify status=progress or bs=....\n  \nTo ue pv instead of dd, simply run:\n sudo pv installer.img -Yo /path/to/block/device \n (The -Y is useful because it causes pv to sync after every write. This avoids the issue where the transfer hangs for a long time at 100% as buffers are flushed to the drive. -Yo is a nice mnemonic to remember :))\n Screenshot\n    submitted by    /u/mort96  \n [link]   [comments]",

If anyone is aware of such a program, I'd appreciate the recommendation.\n \nOLED care software for laptops: This isn't a dealbreaker, but it would be a nice quality-of-life feature to have software that can dim static elements or shift the screen image to prevent burn-in on OLED laptop displays (in my case a Asus Vivobook).\n \n Despite these concerns, I'm still excited about the prospect of using Linux as my primary operating system, and I hope the community continues to address these issues. If anyone has insights or solutions to the points I've raised, I'd love to hear them.\n Furthermore, I'd love to hear what aspects of Linux are lacking for your usecase.\n Wishing you all a wonderful day!\n    submitted by    /u/Execute_Gaming  \n [link]   [comments]",

Really, every application I wanted to go/install worked, there are so many guides and videos on YouTube explaining how to do various things.\n I can understand that some people may not like the fact that sometimes you have to type something into the console, but for me it's not a big deal to learn a dozen commands. I really see that this is a great community and the openness of the system is wonderful!\n I even told a friend to take a look at Linux, but he's not too interested, even after I showed him that it's a really cool system. However, I understand him, no one likes change if they feel comfortable.\n I really think that there is almost no effort (even Arch, which I installed , people said it might be quite difficult for a first Linux, but I really don't feel it)!\n I wanted to write my story and say Hello to the great community, I'm glad I found myself here!

          "description": "I've often seen how people talk about Alacritty's performance for example, given it is GPU-accelerated and written in Rust (hence compiled from a low-level language with very little overhead), but from my personal experience, I notice little to no difference from any other terminal emulators, at least not anything significant. I might want to add that my work environment and tools are mainly CLI-driven, and I mostly use CLI applications for everything (text editor, Git CLI, etc), including all the tools I use for my daily work.\n When choosing a terminal emulator, I focus mostly on usability and features. I personally use Wezterm because I find it incredibly malleable and easy to configure, while also providing very nice defaults. When I have used Alacritty in the past, I have found myself not liking it because it sacrifices a lot of things for the sake of performance, but I find myself unable to perceive the benefits of such performance improvements.\n I wanted to hear people's opinions mainly because I think I might be missing something, so please feel free to share your ideas and experiences.\n    submitted by    /u/ema2159  \n [link]   [comments]",

They started to prefer permissive licenses more as it suited some people's definition of software freedom. The GPL folks, on the other hand, made it an all or none issue, they wanted to license ALL software under GPL and the other side thought that idea was anti diversity.\n This is very much akin to the editor wars of the Boomer era (Vim vs Emacs) or the IDE wars of the millennial era (Visual Basic vs Borland Delphi, even Netbeans vs Eclipse).\n That's where we stand today and a huge majo…",

I'm discussing internaly the idea of creating a blog about it.\n For a quick recap, i'm a Network Engineer / Programmer that is leading a big Linux corporate migration at Policia Militar de Minas Gerais in Brazil. Our custom Ubuntu 22.04 distro is named \"Guara\" and were officially released yesterday. Guara has lots of custom and opensource software developed for the corporation needs, and aims to replace 22K PCs around the Minas Gerais state. In the first phase, we plan to replace 800 machines running an older Debian distros with mate desktop. This will be our first large scale test, as i write this post Guara is already running in 215 machines. In the second phase we plan to replace Windows 7 and 8 machines. To make the transition smoother we're also creating a series of small tik-tok tutorial videos, teaching basics for end users. Just for a quick note, here are our distro highilights:\n  \nUbuntu 22.04.4 based (24.04 already in the works)\n Onlyoffice 8.0\n Google Chrome\n Linphone as voip client\n Droidcam to use smartphones as webcams\n Some proprietary java applications\n Guara-updater \n Custom application developed for Guara.\n Automaticlally push custom configs at system boot\n \n Guara Installer \n Custom application created for Guara.\n Inventory the system and run initial scripts\n \n Argos Network Center \n Custom application created to test system components\n Test network conectivity\n Set http proxy for all the system (browser, cli and electron apps)\n Remote access with dynamic passwords (like teamviewer)\n \n  \nWe plan to open to project and release all the code as opensource, also create a reference documentation for a corporate linux migration with real world effort and dificulties along the way.\n Here is our special launch video, hope you like it.\n https://youtu.be/0uI0sIvVKAY\n    submitted by    /u/Sea-Load4845  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Not a big thing really, but i thought i'd share.\n Part of my job is running Updates on customer systems with ansible. The includes 2 things: \"Initiate\" the Update by selecting an environment to work with (this ensures you don't have to attach the -i flag to every ansible-playbook command) and then running 4-6 playbooks. Additionally, i do \"custom\" rollouts with any subset out of 30 or so playbooks, which are all contained in a folder.\n I was growing tired of having to type the path to customer inventorys and autofilling playbook names. This is tedious and with playooks often having similar names, i tended to have to type them out almost completely.\n So today, i spend a grand total of 20 minutes putting together two scripts that pipe either the environments or playbooks into fzf and the runs the needed command. So i now get interactive fuzzy search through our customers and playbooks. All of that without having to get a software approved by IT and all done in 10 lines of bash total.\n This then also made me realize i can just push my entire ssh config with some grep and filtering into fzf to get an interactive \"ssh launcher\".\n So really, 30 minutes spend wipping up 3 scripts that will now make my job easier and nicer every day. And that's possible because so many awesome tools are made to \"just work\" with each other through text input and output. That's why i love working on Linux every day.\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

And the great thing is that FOSS developers don't gatekeep their software from Windows/macOS (unlike the other way around), so they can install pretty much every free and open source software out there.\n How do I know this method works? Because it's how I fell in love with FOSS and Linux. I needed a way to remux a video file and all the options out there were paid. Until I came upon ffmpeg, which allowed you to not only remux video, but to do pretty much anything with it. It seemed too good for something that good to be free. That's when I looked into it and learned about free and open source software.

          "description": "After installing Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, naturally I tried to install Steam with apt, to no avail. I decided to just install through the App Center. After that every Steam game not using OpenGL failed to open, but after opening Steam through terminal I realised it's because 'Steam could not initalize Vulkan' (or something to that effect). After a few hours of troubleshooting, thinking it was my drivers, or the Vulkan installation and considering just reinstalling the OS, I seen a post where someone said to reinstall Steam. After manually adding the repository and reinstalling it, lo and behold everything worked absolutely fine. I believe it's because installing it through apt, it installs 32-bit drivers that you don't get with the App Center version. This is a very dumbed down version of events, I was troubleshooting for a while.\n Perhaps it's my fault, I'm not sure. But, to my knowledge, I did what any typical user would do. Install OS - Update OS - Install drivers - Install Steam (through apt), which failed, so I chose to install through the App Center. So, I'm going to put fault on Ubuntu for this one. I have no idea why it wasn't in the apt repo in the first place.\n    submitted by    /u/sauix  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "About 3 months ago, I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1b5yk9r/kde_plasma_6_how_many_of_you_are_thinking_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n Now, I can fully say that I've definitely switched from GNOME to KDE Plasma. Mind you, that I'm using NixOS Stable channel, so I only get Plasma 5.27, but even I'm well satisfied. I used GNOME for about 3 years, before switching to KDE Plasma.\n People say KDE Plasma is too much like Windows, it's too much customization, or it's too buggy. I can argue that GNOME isn't enough. It's great for simple users who don't want to customize anything, but over time, it became annoying that the DE had limits, which you could only modify if you added extensions.\n The only bugs I've seen are graphical glitches that causes some stuttering. But it's not really a deal breaker.\n Graphically, KDE Plasma is very impressive. There's a charming affect whenever this DE interacts with you. There's especially a lot \"fading\" effects, like pressing meta key, dragging different open windows, or opening things on the taskbar. But their selection of desktop backgrounds, even their \"start button,\" and even starting it up where it shows the Plasma icon; it's all so charming. Even their notification sounds are very distinguishable.\n Whereas in GNOME, you get some irrelevant sounds like \"dog bark\" or \"glass\" or \"pop\" sound. None of these sounds have style, nor are they memorable.\n It feels really nice when DEs not only make something nice and snappy, but also put some thought and effort into the branding. In GNOME, all you see is the \"activities\" corner, and that doesn't really help, and I can hardly remember the \"foot print\" logo.\n I do have to say, GNOME has made some very useful software that's hard to pass on: GNOME Disks and Disk Usage Analyzer to say the least. I still use some of the default GNOME programs in my systems.\n But overall, KDE Plasma is very impressive.\n    submitted by    /u/nPrevail  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of the largest troubles I had at the start of using Linux was the lack of the Office 365 suite. I know the LibreOffice exists, but most things at university are shared as .pdf, .ppxt, or word, and not being able to quickly and accurately read and edit these documents is simply not okay. \n ​\n It feels like Microsoft is helping the transition to Linux by making the web version of these apps so good. Soon there will be no difference between the web app and desktop app in windows. In which case, Microsoft will have solved my largest sore spot when switching to Linux. I find this very funny, I don't know why they did this, I suppose because they see collaborative work taking off.

          "description": "With the introduction of the Recall feature for Windows, there is renewed interest in the Linux desktop. With that renewed interest, comes renewed hate toward the Linux desktop by people who feel personally confronted by the privacy + freedom oriented philosophy most Linux users subscribe to.\n \"Privacy doesn't matter to me\" is the common response.\n That is fine. What should matter to users is reliance. Plenty of potential Linux users forgoe the switch because their favorite big tech software doesn't run on Linux.\n \"I have built spreadsheets that don't open in LibreOffice/OpenOffice\"\n \"I need Adobe to edit pictures/create music/read my DRM protected books\"\n These are statements that should give you pause. Is it acceptable that you are reliant on a piece of software to the extent that it ties you to an operating system and set of apps that could be taken away from you at any second? Let us focus on the first statement; how much will you pay for Excel (either in cash or your privacy) so that you can continue editing your favorite spreadsheet? Is there a point at which you would force yourself to learn how to program or translate these spreadsheets into LibreOffice?\n You may not care about Privacy or Freedom, but Microsoft and Apple will at some point set a price that will have you wishing you were Independent.\n No one who switches to Linux should expect the transition to be easy. There will be quirks on your system that you will have to iron out and there are just fundamental differences between Windows and Linux that you will have to get used to. In other words you will need to learn. If you think that is a waste of time, that's fine. In my eyes, and in many others', learning a new skill is never a waste if time.\n I hope this provides a useful perspective.\n    submitted by    /u/wallbucks  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am looking for a very lightweight OS where I can install just the minimalistic amount of packages that I intend to use and be able to remove those when I no longer need them. I want to use it for development purposes and have a habit of running and testing a lot things locally. One of my most important criteria for the OS, is to be in control over every single thing that is (being) installed - I will take responsibility for which version it is, all I need to be told by the package manager is which dependencies there are (and sometimes be able to break them).\n  \n I've been eyeing Arch for many years, but here is my main problem: On one hand …",

          "description": "One of the biggest things I missed from my windows install, I finally found it on Linux. Removing background noise from my mic based on a noise profile, it's so perfect, it works so perfectly! https://github.com/lucianodato/noise-repellent\n It is basically a replacement to reafir substract mode. It can get your noise profile, which should just be background noise, and remove it.\n I find this to be a lot more straightforward to do on Windows, for now, at least based on the way I do it currently. On Linux, Carla can look overwhelming, it was actually easier and faster to me but it does look much worse.\n Anyways, an amazing Linux win here. Only problem? Not a single tutorial tells you about this. Not a single source. I figured this out on my own, I mean google told me about noise repellent (prompt: linux reafir) but I figured out on my own that this confusing tutorial on reaplugs on linux I saw a thousand years ago used carla and I said \"maybe Carla helps\" without knowing a single thing about it, and I figured it out from there. Easyeffects also helped because their plugin showed up in Carla and I used it as guidance.\n Loving noise repellent. Wonderful work, and I guess it's smarter because it prefers to reduce noise instead of completely remove it (you can still remove it). I don't know if that's smarter.\n IMPORTANT: If you use Carla and maybe Ardour, your noise profile won't be saved. You need to build it yourself and merge pull request #119. Also, if you break easyeffects like I did, just reset the settings. Also, maybe keep a clean profile of carla saved in case you break something\n I hope there is an easier way to implement this, if not now in the future. Currently, I can't find it if I tell google \"linux remove background noise\", it only tells me of RNNoise and alternatives which work so badly in my case I rather not use it\n    submitted by    /u/patopansir  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am looking into getting a Snapdragon or Strix laptop depending on whether ARM is adopted by this holiday season. The Snapdragon could hopefully be the Year of Linux Desktop we’ve been waiting for. Mass adoption of enterprise software on Linux desktop would be huge. Hoping to get rid of windows for good as most of my terminal scripts are cross platform already and I have a 4090 PyTorch setup that I can play modded Skyrim/Fallout on proton whenever I get the itch.\n There is only one piece of software keeping me from ditching Windows 100%. \n FL Studio. \n As of right now, Linux Pro Audio is better than Windows because Jack/Pipewire is far better Pro Audio Driver than ASIO/CoreAudio have ever been. \n Wondering if any guru has gotten it working with real time latency. Wine causes XRUNS when running the WineAsio driver and buffer sizes and latency must increase to accommodate. The Wine NSPA Kernel that is meant to fix real time audio gives me better performance but xruns pop up at ~15ms or under. \n If not, can any recommend a KVM solution that would let me run it on Mac/Windows VM that can route with Jack/Pipewire? Would obv pass through audio card. But if there is a config out there that would allow me to run the FL without needing to restart every time, I’d love to hear it. I would even buy another audio interface just for routing from the pass through audio via cable to my Linux audio card. \n I know the answer is likely no but I can’t be the only moron that has been trying to make this work for years.

This weekend I will wipe my Windows installation and make a \"final\" installation (although let's be real, it will never really be final...).\n I notice I'm making a lot of tweaks to various files in /etc,... like configure Pacman mirrors, networking, tweak sound setup, mess with fstab, and much more.\n The problem is, I have failed to keep track of these changes. So when I will install my \"final\" setup, I will no doubt forget a lot of the tweaks I've made. It's not a big deal, I can just apply them again later, but still it's nice to remember and review these changes. Also maybe later in the future, if I want to install Arch elsewhere, or reinstall my system, it would be nice to see how my /etc will have deviated from the defaults...\n I have found etckeeper, which is nice and I'll probably check it out, but seems more about keeping a complete log of all changes to /etc, which is not entirely what I'm personally interested in. If I update some packages, and they replace some defaults with new defaults I probably won't care about it that much (unless everything breaks of course). But I am really interested in e.g. if manually made some tweaks to the NTP config which I want to replicate on my future laptop install.\n How do you manage this?

No properly engineered cache grows without bounds. There should be an upper size limit and a retention policy configured in pacman.conf. Then every time pacman adds something to the cache, it should check the size and policy, and discard as needed.

It's been a pretty smooth experience so far, especially after the 555 drivers for nVidia were released. Wayland has been usable and very enjoyable.\n KDE Plasma 6\n SDDM\n nVidia Proprietary Drivers (555 beta drivers)\n I jumped on my desktop before leaving for work this morning and noticed in the system tray there were updates available. Opened up Discovery and installed the available updates. I quickly skimmed through the list and saw a few Mesa packages, and a bunch of KDE apps updating from 6.2 to 6.3.\n Installed the updates, everything completed. I rebooted my PC and it appeared to be booting up just fine. When the screen switched to what I would assume would have been the login screen it just went black instead. After a few seconds the UEFI logo for my motherboard was displayed on the screen again and nothing happens after this.\n I used CTRL+ALT+F3 to access the shell, rechecked pacman for updates, but didn't find any. System is fully updated. I tried another reboot, same result.\n I honestly didn't have a lot of time to poke around and troubleshoot as I had to run to work. I'll be heading home soon. Does anyone have any recommendations as to where to look to troubleshoot this or fix this?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/techdaddy1980  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not sure what happened, my guess is it hibernated at a critical time of the system update.\n So, I pull out my trusted USB Arch installer, mount my ssh, arch-chroot, rerun the update to try and fix it, it runs successfully, all well and good. \n I reboot, and the boot sequence welcomes me with a message about my lvm partition being corrupted. I try to let the repair tool run, but to no avail: my system has about 0.5% of my blocks corrupted. Instead of trying to repair it, I decide that the easiest way forward is to do a fresh install. \n Here's the catch. I had a 10h plane trip planned for months 2 days later. Well, if I have 10h to kill, maybe I can use it to reinstall Arch? I check online, and internet access on the plane is not too expensive, so... Why the heck not. \n Fast forward today, as soon as we take off, I start the install, using my mobile phone as a hotspot (to avoid having to deal with signing into the plane wifi website directly) and a Arch Wiki browser. As usual, it takes me a few tries to get a bootable system, but I get there! \n It was a very interesting experience, because with a very slow connection, I had to be very careful and minimalistic about which packages I install. I now have a simple KDE Plasma + a browser running on Arch, all at 30k feet above ground. \n    submitted by    /u/Skasch  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had to move to GNOME on Wayland and it has been a relatively smooth experience, but when I tried to customize it like a Tiling WM but I keep fighting with stupid GUIs which are infinitely more complicated than working on a glorious config file. I need a Dynamic Tiling WM on Wayland but I don't know how developed and stable are they. Which ones are seeing the most active development and are the most reliable?\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/OverlordBaal666  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to change it to something else. The man page says that there is a shortcut function named focus_inputbar but binding this function just focuses the inputbar (as the name suggests) and so I need to manually type a slash plus the search term after the shortcut.\n Is there any way of doing this?

I'm using headphones via jack and stereo speakers via a digital output.\n Under Windows I was/am used to being able to switch between these two devices via the sound icon. Under Arch, however, only one audio device is displayed. \n I can only switch between the audio devices if I change the audio profile in the settings. \n Through trial and error, I was able to determine that the headphones are analog stereo output and the speakers are digital stereo. \n Now to my question: Is this the intended behavior? Or is this an operating error on my part? Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find anything about this \"problem\" in the Arch forum or here and I'm not sure what exactly to look for.\n Is there a way to simply switch between two predefined profiles via the sound icon? \n If that is important: I am using an MSI MAG B550 Tomahawk motherboard\n    submitted by    /u/little_administrator  \n [link]   [comments]",

The OneDrive folder is syncing with the cloud in both directions without issue.\n I am stuck at the next step which is trying to have the local mounted NAS folder sync with the mounted OneDrive folder. I want this to be an automated/ongoing process where ideally there is a check for a difference between the folders and if there is the backup is triggered.\n I have tried searching for solutions but I feel like the fact these folders I am trying to sync are remote folders mounted as local ones is causing some issues.

I was looking for a much more lightweight and more private alternative to Windows and Debian Linux came up a lot. After reading up on it and seeing how everyone says its on of the most stable distros out there I thought this might be perfect for my usecase.\n My usecase:\n I'm a digital artist, I use graphics tablet via HDMI and USB ports and I dabble in game-dev with Godot game engine. I don't play any games I have a Xbox for that, but I do like to watch Stuff on YouTube a lot as well as Netflix/Disney+. I use a laptop but its a desktop replacement machine so I don't care about Battery life. It has a 1060 6GB GPU. Currently looking for good alternative programs to Krita.\n So my questions are:\n  \nIf you use private browsing in a browser like Chrome or Firefox, is it really private? Like is it possible for any contents to spill over to disk or get cached to disk and is there a easy way to prevent that?\n Will I need a anti-virus for Linux and if so which one is the best one to get that is low impact on my system?\n Can everything or most thing be accomplished by using the GUI/desktop\n Can I have multiple drives on Linux, like on my windows system I have a C drive and then another SSD which is my D drive.\n Is Debian stable? Like are there any forced updates or crashes that can happen?\n Is there a way to delete all traces of USB drive history? \n Is there any keylogging or stuff like that on Debian?\n  \nThat's all the things I can think of at the moment.\n    submitted by    /u/GentleDomFanatic  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For a while now, I've been trying to find more up-to-date alternatives based on Debian, so far I've found three of them interesting:\n Kali As it contains a multitude of software focused on cybersecurity, many associate it with activities focused on the same field, this is true, but another truth is the repository is full of useful for a common user and updated software.For gnome lovers, this seems to be the only one, besides Ubuntu, that has a more up-to-date gnome, apart from the fact that Nautilus is outdated for reasons I don't know. Until then, it seems like a better alternative. 1. Imports Debian packages, that is, it has its own repository; 2. It is officially Rolling Release, unlike Debian Testing; and 3. Is maintained by the community;\n Siduction To be honest, I can't say much about this one, but it looks like it's a Rolling Release that uses unstable repositories. It is not so autonomous from Debian that one can even question the reason why use it instead of unstable itself?\n Ubuntu There's not much that can be said, it's an excellent choice. Many who don't recommend Ubuntu do so because of snap, but the truth is Ubuntu is still a great choice even or especially without snap. It's not that it's about hating snaps or not, but if canonical allowed the community to keep .deb versions of the snaps they took down, that would be the best. But users can stay out of these snaps, for example, for FF using the Mozilla PPA, and I'm not a fan of having multiple software sources on the system, it's an easy opening for problems.\n Do you know of another with the following characteristics?: 1. It's a community project; 2. Focuses exclusively on the .deb format; 3. Instead of using direct Debian repositories, import from salsa into it's own repositories; 4. It is released every 6 months or a year, or even is a Rolling Release.\n Tell me in the comments \n    submitted by    /u/ExaHamza  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm curious to hear from people with experience on authoring Debian packages: what steps do you need to take to go from having no experience at all in contributing a package to having it present in future stable versions of Debian?\n Some of you might recognise me as the original author of ALE, and a very small number might know I'm the President & Treasurer of the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organisation that holds the copyright for ALE and other projects, Dense Analysis. I love working on FOSS and will do in some capacity until my last breath.\n I really, really love xmms2 and I've been a regular user of it since around 2010. I was really sad last year when xmms2 just stopped working completely in KDE Neon, and then really happy recently when an update to the packages fixed everything. What's even better is that I wrote what I believe is a very good implementation of MPRIS integration for xmms2, which upon completing a recent update actually continued to fuction stably with zero changes to my code. I previously made a package available via an Ubuntu PPA I still use myself. (Eat your own dogfood.)\n Repeating my initial question, what should I reasonably do to move this package into Debian stable itself in future? I think mailing lists are a very 1990's thing and have always been strange to me, and I'm from 1989 myself. I am very comfortable with IRC, though it's been a while.

Since Debian 12 came out I started to get an issue with delayed mouse input I made post about it there:\n https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/14m9gxq/mouse_input_lag/\n Today I accidentally found a fix and possibly bug in Gnome. I started game through terminal as usual and there was mouse delay. Then I rebooted machine and locked screen since I had to left for few minutes when I came back I unlocked screen, I run the game thorugh terminal again and I was surprised my mouse worked flawlessly. I rebooted machine run the game again and there was delay again. I started to think what I did differently and came to conclusion that I locked screen. So I tried again I rebooted, locked screen wait some seconds unlocked screen run the game and there was no delay again. Not sure why that happens but perhaps something is funky with compositor when locking/unlocking screen?\n tl;dr Locking and unlocking screen with meta+L shortcut fixes the issue for some reason.\n    submitted by    /u/andreas213  \n [link]   [comments]",

A BTRFS file system with a snapshot utility and grub-btrfs seems to be the closest to the nixos implementation from what I read. However that seems to require compiling grub-btrfs from source.\n I have never compiled a tool for my system before. As I understand I would need to try and manually keep up with update the package. Worry about dependencies due to debian having slightly older versions. And making sure to remove them on system upgrade.\n As I want the system rollback because I am trying to learn more about my system while acknowledging I could screw everything up, this seems like a bad idea.\n So I am curious what would the easiest/safest option be? Simply hope that I don't mess anything up too badly so I can get at least get past grub to use a basic timeshift reversion?\n I apologize for being ignorant. Reading into btrfs backups and ext4 rsync backups has gone a bit over my head and I don't want to blindly follow tutorials. So the plan is to find a starting point then try and understand it.\n    submitted by    /u/FroDude258  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I am running into issues after install. I have tried two different types of install (1) graphical install with KDE Plasma installation & other prerequisites as part of standard install and (2) graphical install BUT unticking everything except for \"standard system utilities\". The issue is whether I choose to install KDE Plasma Task via graphical install or install KDE standard via command line, I can't boot into the default kernel running 6.1.0-21-amd64 and gives me a out of memory error. But if I choose Advance Options in grub menu and choose kernel running 6.1.0-18-amd64, I can boot into Debian with no issues. Question - how do I make sure grub menu always selects the 6.1.0-18 kernal and I don't keep having to go Advance Options and manually select it.

Then tried fedora, I actually liked it, but the KDE spin is too bloated and dnf is pretty slow for me even after adding parallel downloads and fastestmirror, even using dnf5, the speeds are really REALLY shitty in my country, I guess it's a mirror and region problem not a dnf one. Besides why does it use so many resources on idle??? 2.8gb RAM, that's literally MORE THAN THRICE of what Arch used, Battery Life was also much worse compared to arch, also those ugly windows-esque offline updates at boot really irked me, although I did turn them off. Throw in RedHat/IBM and the excitement goes away. Finally ended up installing a minimal debian and installing pipewire, ufw etc. and the minimal kde desktop on top of it. Debian is where I'm gonna stay, been using it for 3 months and I love it. The workload on my laptop isn't as intense and debian handles it pretty well (I'm a law student, I just open documents and a web browser, I have no time for tinkering or trying out new stuff.

There are differences that power users care (systemd, SysVinit or Runit; Pulseaudio or Pipewire; X11 or Wayland), but common users don't notice.\n There are minor differences difficult to detect. When we type the command of a non-installed app, Debian and Sparky say that it wasn't found while MX and Mint say to ask the admin to install the package with the app.\n I tested some distros to see the memory used. I only started the computer and the only thing I did is to open the system monitor.\n XFCE (based on Debian 11)\n …",

I know radvd is often used to work with router announcements etc.\n I'm in the position where I can use prefix delegation with my ISP.\n ​\n So basically, what would I need to do to implement the following:\n  \nI have VLAN's on the lan-side, I want to make sure that some have IPv6 addresses, others don't.\n I want to be able to work with fixed IPv6 addresses, so that I can configure nftables rules like \"this whole vlan has no internet access, however IPv6 address A.B.C.D.E.F in this vlan does have internet access\". Basically, I need to be able to pin hosts to the same addresses every time and use those in nftables rules.\n I would prefer something which isn't depending on my ISP who might change their prefix delegation at some point in time. I'm aware that IPv6 has a range for internal addresses, fc00::/7 address block. If I would need this, how would I implement this? Is this in combination with IPv6 NAT, which doesn't seem recommended?\n If the outcome is that I do need IPv6 NAT'ing: what would be needed to implement this?\n  \n​\n Looking forward to your feedback, I hope there are people on here who have done this before and provide some guidance!\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/jefkebazaar24  \n [link]   [comments]",

Neither did including it in the \"replaces\" field. This reddit comment implies this is possible, but it's not working for me. I also followed the steps from this tutorial.\n I also tried creating blank packages called totem, gnome-sushi, yelp, but when installing them, apt tries to be smart and tells me it's going to install the repo version rather than my local .deb file. I didn't try installing it directly with dpkg though, maybe that's worth a try (but even then, this wouldn't be my preferred way since then I would have to create a dummy deb for each package I don't want).\n    submitted by    /u/that_leaflet  \n [link]   [comments]",
