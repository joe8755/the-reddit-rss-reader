          "description": "Hey Folks!\n I am starting off with C as my first ever programming language. (I have some prior programming experience with C and Python but never managed to go pass the basics. Hopefully I will get to a point where I can do something useful with these languages around this time)\n Nonetheless, I am following the classic \"The C Programming Language\" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. In the introductory chapter (A TUTORIAL INTRODUCTION - Page 6), the first example to print Hello World goes something like this:\n # include <stdio.h> main () { printf(\"Hello, world\\n\"); } \n When I compiled it with the cc or gcc compiler, an error was produced:\n error: return type defaults to 'int' \n Naturally, I went back to the thought process that I had in my previous attempts at learning C. I simply declared the return type for the main() function to be void and it compiled successfully. The changed code goes like this:\n # include <stdio.h> void main () { printf(\"Hello, world\\n\"); } \n What am I missing out from the example? Has it something to do with the Compiler Version that I am on? Or is it something entirely different?\n    submitted by    /u/Desperate_Touch_1918  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am currently in week 6 of the first course, which deals mainly with hardware.\n This week though, it is required to build an assembler, which is the first software above the hardware. The course teachers say it can be built with any programming language, like Java and Python.\n The thing is, right now I am mostly familiar with C, but I am also not an expert. I’ve programmed in Python on the past, but I will need to refresh, as I have used C more lately.\n But should I build the assembler, and maybe the next required software (I think it is a VM and a compiler), with C? Like isn’t it too complicated because of all the memory management you have to consider, no classes (as opposed to C++) etc.?\n Also, if you’re familiar with this course, I would like to consult with you if you think I should proceed to the second part? Or take CS50x before, which I have heard is very good for starting out with programming?

I think it would massively boost my coding skills as well as help me understand web servers better. \n I'm curious what your process is for doing this, or what process do you recommend? As far as I understand, the main way to \"look up how to use something\" like sockets is to use man pages, and do you just reference those and keep looking at whatever you don't understand for the next thing and next thing to etc.? I feel like I have about 50 terminal tabs open because I'm down the rabbit hole of reading man pages, not complaining because I've found out some super interesting stuff, it just doesn't feel super efficient. \n Let me know if that's just what we do or if you have some other method, I get there's obviously books as well.

My goal is to create a grid that can dynamically change its size during runtime, which rules out arrays due to their fixed size. After some research, I've learned that vectors in C++ offer the flexibility I need, allowing me to resize them on the fly.\n Despite dedicating hours to this endeavor, I'm finding the process of dynamically resizing the grid using vectors to be quite daunting. Specifically, I'm struggling to increase the size of the grid by (rows+2) x (columns+2) when certain conditions are met.\n If there's anyone proficient in C++ who has experience with dynamic resizing of 2-D vectors, I would greatly appreciate any guidance, tips, or code snippets you could share to help me overcome this obstacle.

I thought I'd share it here for anyone interested: https://dma-neves.github.io/dma/raptor.html\n Raptor offers similar performance and capabilities to thrust, but offers a more abstract interface. Raptor provides a set of smart containers (vector, array, vector, scalar) and skeletons (map, reduce, scan, filter, sort) that can be applied over the smart containers. Containers can store the data both on the host (CPU) and device (GPU), and expose a seemingly unified memory address space. Skeletons are executed on the device. Containers are automatically and lazily allocated and synchronized whenever a skeleton is executed.\n    submitted by    /u/dma_snow    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I'm pretty new to cpp and am trying to work out the best design for a problem I'm having. I'm wondering if shared pointers are the way to go. \n The problem: I have a class that makes an expensive database query during construction. The information retrieved is static though and most of the class functions don't even depend on the data. Furthermore, a class instance might be constructed multiple times during a single call from the upstream application , and each time this expensive and often unnecessary db call is made.\n My idea: Lazy load the db query only when it's first needed and then store the data in a global cache that will exist for the entirety of the application call. I can't control if 10 instances of this class are created, but I can limit to a single db call instead of 10. \n Is a shared pointer amongst the class instances a feasible and a solution here? My understanding is that the a shared pointer to the cache will keep it alive as I need, but I'm unsure how to pass a pointer between the instances like this. I'm also wondering if I'm overthinking the problem and there is a simpler solution I'm not considering. I'd appreciate any advice or insight, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/epicmouse77    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

If anyone knows of a library that fits this description, I would really appreciate your recommendations.\n Additionally, if anyone is aware of a wrapper for any established libraries like Eigen, Armadillo, BLAS, LAPACK, xtensor, or Blaze that adapts their functionality to align with the proposed std::linalg standard in C++26, I’d be very interested in learning about it. Such a wrapper would ideally allow for easier migration to std::linalg when it becomes standard. Please share any leads or resources you might have.\n Thanks in advance for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/loumalouomega    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone.\n I’m relatively new to C++ and have a project im working on. The basis of the project is a basketball game where randomized players and their stats are generated through a draft system then stored into multiple text files. \n I have correlated the players and their attributes using array positions. I have the system set up correctly where I can write the data to the text file and read from it but I am unable to run the code unless I manually go and delete the info from the text file. Only when I do this do the errors disappear.\n It defeats the point if the players stats are not able to be retrieved the first time they were drafted in the game, as I want to be able to implement a save feature where you can pick up where you left off. I have implemented this by creating a main menu, with a switch function, allowing a player to either reset their data by truncating the text files, and undergo the draft process all over again, or continue with the information already in the text file. The issue is however, as I said before, I cannot run this without deleting the data in the file, which I do not want the player to have to do unless they want to reset the game.\n The errors themselves are 2 C2059 errors and Expected a Declaration in the text file themself, which confused me.\n LINK: https://github.com/kvtrey5/BASKETBALL-GAME\n    submitted by    /u/isjupiteramoon    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a bit awkward but I decided to keep mine on anyway.\n Is this very common in your experience?\n I assume they might do it for bias reasons (definitely had women not wanting to get judged because of their appearance and I get that from what I've seen in our field) or just don't feel like it. I didn't push for it as I generally tend to have my team decide by themselves if they turn their camera on during meetings and glad to do as much as possible in Slack. But for a first time meeting people I still find it super hard to... bond with them and then later tell them apart. Or even hire someone without ever having seen their face once.\n Last time I interviewed people for my team a few years ago I didn't notice this, most just seemed to turn on the cam without having it explicitly stated.\n EDIT: \n For the next rounds I'll definitely see that I explicitly state \"video call\". I was just surprised people don't do this by default but perhaps I'm just becoming boomer :). But there's a \"give a talk and we discuss\" round anyway, so I hope at least there they'll turn their cam on.\n I should probably add, this is for a very senior/scientific role, so we also have to meet customers at least virtually, pitch projects, give talks, hold webinars, perhaps go to a conference etc.\n    submitted by    /u/met0xff  \n [link]   [comments]",

While I hadn't yet replaced it I left it blank and suddenly received 2 unsolicited messages from recruiters and 2 responses from other job listings in the span of 1 week. For context, I had spent 6 months and ~800 job apps which I know isn't that many but I haven't even gotten a phone screen. My last and only interview was 6 months ago, where I made it to the final round and was rejected because they had an applicant with more experience than me (I had over 2 YOE and it was a junior role FML). \n Anyway I'm starting to question the timing of these recruiter messages. I don't think there was anything wrong with my profile picture. The only critique I could think of is that it was a bit outdated so I might have looked too young. I don't really want this to turn into a r/RoastMe post so just bear with me and assume I am just an average looking person. \n I think the more likely scenario is that there is some algorithm that LinkedIn uses that detects when users become less engaged on the platform and then decides to rapidly promote that user into reengaging again. This may come across as tinfoil hatty but I do think this is the most likely outcome since the timing does not make any sense and I haven't read anything to suggest the job market suddenly improved a ton. I am curious if other people have had similar things happen to them like this.\n Also an FYI I am a White Male U.S. Citizen with 2.5 YOE in a popular tech stack in a west coast city. \n    submitted by    /u/nysoxfan01  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi. I want to write my own NES \"cartridge decoder\" that will serve as a helper tool during development of my NES emulator. One of it's capabilities will be dissasembly of a PRG ROM. However the thing with these ROMs is that data is mixed up with the code and it can look roughly like this:\n <some data>\n <couple of instructions>\n <some data>\n <couple of instructions> \n And etc. So if you are looking at compiled binary you really have no way of telling whether given byte is treated as instruction, instruction operand (or part of it) or data used by the program.\n I came up with 2 approaches how I could tackle this:\n  \nLazy approach - Just interpret everything as instruction (of course by taking their variable length into account)\n Better approach - Interpret the program, not exactly by executing it but going instruction by instruction, tracking where it jumps or which subroutines it calls. While processing branch instructions process both cases. Read interrupt vectors and interpret them as well until reaching RTS instruction. Everything else would be considered raw data and dead code would also fall into that category. Basically disassembler would go instruction by instruction to determine where code execution can lead to distinguish instructions from the data.\n  \nI never specifically wrote a dissasembler, so I would like to know if my ideas are at least good, or there are better, more reliable approaches to that out there.\n    submitted by    /u/Sea-Work-173  \n [link]   [comments]",

From the documentation I've found online, it seem like the serial port derives its clock from the system clock directly, instead of through the timer DIV, like the audio hardware:\n Cycle-Accurate Game Boy Docs, Section 6\n Does this mean that even when the serial port is not enabled (via SC bit-7) this counter is increasing? What happens when the serial port is enabled? Does the counter reset to 0?\n    submitted by    /u/dajolly  \n [link]   [comments]",

Last time i posted here was in 2019 I think with my chip-8 emulator. Now I have a created an Intel 8080 emulator!\n It started out as a space invaders emulator but I got more interested in creating a disassembler/debugger and implementing all the instructions instead :)\n For those interested in creating an intel 8080 emulator i have modified the (common?) test cpudiag.bin rom since it assumes the start address is 255 and not 0 which makes all the jumps/calls go to the wrong addresses.\n Links to source code and test rom:\n Github repository\n cpudiagFixed.bin\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Vonido  \n [link]   [comments]",

The API is composed of micro-services. It does biz logic things like user management, fetching results, ingesting media inputs and passing them into our core engine which is owned by MLEs... \n We are a small startup, I am the first and only devops engineer at the moment. I initially wrote authorization and owned load balancing into the system but out of feeling that I was spread too thin I passed this ownership off to the fullstack team. My sense over the past few months is that the fullstack team shouldn't ideally own load balancing and authorization, they tend to do things really quickly and dirtily and I suppose I'm not fully comfortable with their approach. My sense is that this should be owned by security minded SREs who are already responsible for production.\n Can you guys assist in providing insight into my potential blindspots? What are your thoughts?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/MachineDisastrous771  \n [link]   [comments]",

An awesome paradigm at the base layer and so much interesting built on top of it.\n Observability - almost a science in itself and plenty to get into (or related to) be it monitoring, alerting, analytics, service management. \n Platform management - building out a consumable platform, kinda like being a developer for developers.\n Architect - the problem I have with this is developers are going to have their own software architects doing system design that the may overlap already with the infra side. Also many expect engineers to have software architects skills anyway. So where does that leave the cloud/DevOps architect? I feel there is not much mileage in this path.\n Any others?

I never got any projects... never got any tasks... I literally did nothing for 2.5 years but simple bash scripts here and there.\n So I quit and joined another company. I got a bit more work here, more projects, etc. I was able to get a team of 2 junior engineers, we worked on projects here and there\n I didn't \"grow\" because I was always the most senior.... I had nobody to get guidance or advice from.\n Whenever we built new projects, I basically \"architected\" it and built it with the team... but... it was 99.9% me teaching them stuff. I never really learned much I feel.\n Even simple basic things like... code standards, I just did what I felt like was the best. For our software design patterns, I used GoF stuff I learned from reading, where it SEEMED like it would be good, but I had no guidance or feedback! I architected a distributed system when we finally got a bigger project and while it worked and scaled, I have no idea if I did it \"right\"...\n Now that I'm laid off, and looking for a new job... I feel like a serious imposter during my interviews. A) I \"architected\" and \"standardized code on the team\" but... it was a team 3 and it feels like bullshit and I don't really know anything. and B) When I get asked about design patterns... sure I \"know\" the patterns but...

They pushes back on every feedback they gets in the PRs with very very long responses, links to resources, etc. \n We decided to let them work on a new initiative, so they could take their time to understand our process since there wasn’t a hard deadline on it. The project has become a deviant and a one-off where they didn’t follow any of the patterns we used on any of the other services. Basically you tell them, we need to do C and to get there we need to build A and B. He then goes and builds E, F, G, H and then finally C. You tell him that that’s not how we usually do things, and then they asks you to write the requirements for it, and they will make sure that C matches those requirements… I don’t think anyone else on the team would be able to contribute to this project or support it, which is almost like a legacy service being brand new.\n They don’t get involved in any of the other tasks the rest of the team does, but constantly requires time from everyone to review their PRs. They also started getting very involved with other teams organizing lunch and learns, presentations, discussions and trying to get buy-in from other teams in how they do things.\n This individual is a very smart person and I don’t doubt his technical skills.. but is really a pain to work with him. He seem to be very obsessed with the processes shared with other teams instead of anything related to us.

Little did I know, they were about to announce a funding round, invalidating the previous strike price and the strike price that I would receive has tripled (which I have not yet been granted). Sure I still get X # options however they are now at 3x the strike price. This means that instead of paying say $200k to exercise my options I have to pay $600k if I ever want to exercise (with the risk that it becomes potentially be worthless if it never IPOs).\n Given that I don't see the company realistically going IPO until at least 5+ years, this means if I leave before then I will have to either shell out a large amount of money or just leave my stake on the table. If I just leave it on the table then it only makes financial sense for me to stay at the company the amount of time equal to the amount of options I am willing to exercise.\n Has anyone else joined in the middle of a raise unknowingly and are there other solutions?

I'm going through some existential crisis and just felt like writing it out.\n I've been a developer for around 14-15 years and have worked on a lot of different tech and systems and have a good breadth of knowledge i'd say. \n But i've never really worked on anything with huge amounts of data or low latency requirements or extremely high throughout etc. Have always worked in big orgs and on systems with moderate non-functional specs and lots of business features. Historically i've not been into developer communities or open source contributions (earlier in career due to lack of awareness and now due all sorts of stuff including lack of motivation to do this outside work hours). I'm trying to change this a bit recently by getting more involved in communities in my company.\n Having said that within my teams i've always got good remarks, hikes and considered as a solid all-round senior. Pay was always good and I mostly enjoyed my work (was almost too grateful to even be hired as a SWE at the start). I also keep myself quite updated even though most of that knowledge stays mostly theoretical.\n As I evaluate my career i wonder if I should have seeked out more challenging work? There seems to be an expectation that after all these years one would have atleast tackled some hard technical challenge and I cant seem to think of any. Slowly starting to feel if i'm actually good to even handle anything challenging now and that's not helping my confidence to even look for such opportunities. What if I get an opportunity and fail?\n Just wondering if others have gone through such a phase and found their peace somehow? Or any advice on how to position myself for the next 15 years of my career? \n    submitted by    /u/rchan88  \n [link]   [comments]",

I genuinely do not slack off at all, but the fact that I keep receiving this feedback (and that it has followed me between companies) indicates to me that I’m clearly at least doing a poor job of representing myself.\n For example: once, after a particularly rough sprint a manager had a version of this conversation with me, and we pulled up metrics, and over the course of that sprint I’d completed more tickets than anyone else on the team, and had completed the same number of “urgent” tickets as the rest of the team combined. (And it’s not as though I just pick easy tickets to pump my numbers)\n In one-off situations like that it’s easy to be like, look, I’m sorry I’m giving off this appearance, but if we look at the actual work that got done I think it’s clear I’m pulling my weight… but it’s really not a conversation I enjoy having over and over.

I replied that we could discuss it, but gave the reasons why it wouldn't be a good idea for them.\n They also copied our management and our director came and yelled at me for \"requirements fishing\" - someone at the customer felt we were trying to increase the scope to inflate the contract value.

My company has an office out here, but announced recently they're closing it at the end of the month, after which I'll be fully remote.\n I don't particularly care for the city I live in, and thought that remote work would be a great opportunity to move to a larger city with more energy, namely NYC. I've been floating this idea around my team since the announcement of the closure was made, and haven't gotten any negative feedback around it, so I felt pretty confident about the topic when I officially asked my boss if I could move to NYC after I become fully remote.\n He got back to me a few days later (after speaking with HR), and said that a move is totally doable, if I take a $50k pay cut in my TC. I was pretty floored at this request, especially since by any metric NYC is more expensive than where I currently live, but the rationale is that the pay bands in NYC are ostensibly lower for my job compared to my current city.\n I'm wondering, is this level of pay cut common for a move from the west coast to NYC? It seems totally unreasonable to me, especially after looking at jobs at some of the other tech companies operating out of NYC.

Developers are going to want to build their sandcastles. And the idea I think it was trying to express was the desire of software developerss to build the most complete, robust, and elegant solutions they could engineer for the problems they are trying to solve.\n Sometimes this may be good, but the context I think I remember the metaphor in was that of, \"project managers are necessary otherwise develops will never make progress towards a end goal, with endless scope creep and analysis paralysis\". Thinking about it now, I think this metaphor was being used in reference to the video game industry when I heard it.\n This post is two part, firstly, and mostly for my curiosity, I was hoping you all who are familiar with this expression could remind me exactly how it goes and provide your take on it.\n Secondly, I would like to start a discussion on the topic. At work, I don't really seem to face this issue that often. But when working on a personal project, I seem to almost never get very far because I get stuck in this trance where I am trying to over engineer the first problems I come across with any amount of complexity. For example, I have tried writing a vulkan renderer multiple times now, and each time I get stuck on trying to build a thesis on device and queue selection, coding for every use case that I can imagine, when in reality I only need one or two simple methods for accomplishing this task.

          "description": "Apart from using an actual debugger - in some cases you can’t have a debugger attached to the process, or the behavior you’re facing is complex and emergent, and you cannot just put a breakpoint or log statement there. If attaching a debugger is possible, then of course I just attach a debugger.\n Let me share mines:\n  \nIsolate - if something’s tricky, try to have the simplest isolated reproduction that you can have. This cuts out unnecessary complexity and usually also speeds up iterations.\n Isolate early - it’s tempting to think that “I just need to fix this here, redeploy and it’ll probably work”, but I found that more often than not, I should have isolated the case earlier. It’s balancing between the likelihood of fixing it in place in a couple of iterations with a longer cycle and between investing time upfront in the isolation to have shorter feedback cycle. Also, the skill of efficiently isolating cases is something that improves with practice.\n “Approach from two ends” - I’m not sure if this has a name, sometimes it can be called ‘binary search’. When I tried everything that I could think of but it all doesn’t seem to make any sense, then I step back and try to ‘brute force’ it. This usually starts by taking my problematic case on one end, and a known working example of what I’m trying to achieve on the other end. Then I start modifying on both ends: stripping down parts on the first end, and adding more and more parts on the other end, so that they become more and more similar. At some point, the difference that I didn’t think of pops out. A similar approach also works for example if a new release of an app has a regression, but it’s not clear from the code change why - then we can start producing synthetic approximation releases in a test environment to see where exactly things break. I really like this approach, it really helped me solve cases where I had no idea why things don’t work.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/my_dev_acc  \n [link]   [comments]",

So naturally other devs are maximum junior-mid level.\n I feel like I am loosing my skills and this is my biggest worry. I am super afraid to become bad at coding after working in these kind of projects. I am literally abandoning typescript and good coding standarts.

It's kind of my thing and companies like it because I always work on top priorities.\n However this has exposed me to the fact that every single local build never ever works initially. Normally there are some docs slightly out of date, you follow them and error. Some unhappy container, undefined variables, some stuff that doesn't install, unit tests won't run.\n The only way to make it run is to fight through it during long several days of debugging, normally heavily assisted by someone in the team that has the right lore (normally this person is busy for the same reason so can only help here and there) \n It kills me that in my 10 plus years I haven't seen much progress in this part of the dev cycle. Docker was supposed to fix it but then we made stuff around docker complex. We have fancy complicated and fragil infra. Don't get me started with stuff like bazel. When Mr bazel had enough and leaves the company, it becomes the \"we don't know what that does so don't touch it\" and it's exactly where it will break when I'm trying to get up to speed. \n Sorry a bit ranty. \n Have I been unlucky in my career or have you seen this issue too?

Still it could of been worse I could of chosen a MMORPGGGGGH\n Don't make a major gameplay change midway (I done 2 on this game adventure, turn based -> realtime & dungeons -> Open World). Lesson learnt, If the game ain't happening, scrap it and start something new, don't try to shoehorn what you have into this cause it will bite you in the ass later \n Don't roll your own code. i.e re-invent the wheel, Sure this is oldhat advice. But take it from an oldfart, dont. I went from my own engine in c++/opengl & my own physics engine -> my engine + ODE -> Unity & C#. I wasn't cool rolling my own, I was just a dick wasting hours, hours that could of been useful realizing my dream \n  \nPositive advice:\n  \nOnly 2 rules in programming\n #1 KISS - Always keep it simple, you may think you're smart doing some shortcut or elegant solution, but 50% of the time you're creating problems down the track, why roll the dice, play it smart. OK this is a mantra but #2 is not well known\n #2 Treat everything as equal. AKA - don't make exceptions, no matter how much sense they appear to make, inevitably it will bite you in the ass later\n Now I still violate both the rules even now (after 40 years of programming) So this is do as I say, not as I do thing\n Don't be afraid to go out of your comfort zone.

          "description": "Introduction\n repo\n This is a proof of concept/Prototype\n Almost a year ago, I started working on a GDScript compiler. And then stopped because getting GDExtensions to work (even in C) was a pain (because it's not documented). This was my first time using rust, so the code was kinda bad. \n I have revisited the project, but it's a bit different now. Instead of using LLVM to generate machine code, I generate rust, because if I can use rust I will (even for shaders). \n And with help of gdext, I won't have to deal with GDExtensions.\n Benchmarks\n The rust version (without optimizations) can run 5 times faster in this case nth Fibonacci number.\n  GDScript: 390 ms Rust: 77 ms \n (Code for the benchmark can be seen in addon/bench.gd)\n Features\n  \nFunction\n Calling functions in the same file\n Math\n for loops\n while loops\n if\n variables\n Addon\n maybe I missed something else\n  \nLimitations\n  \nUsing other Nodes.\n calling function outside the file\n Can generate wrong rust code\n And a lot more\n  \nFAQ\n Why rust?\n I like it.\n Will this make normal GDScript obsolete?\n No, GDScript is really nice to debug. And fast to iterate.\n Why is GDScript slow?\n IMO, I think the main problem is loops, it's something that any interpreted language fears.\n Why not make a JIT?\n While it will be better for dynamically typed language like GDScript, but it will be harder to implement. Oh, and JIT's won't work on IOS.\n Why not use rust or c++ direly\n Debug in Godot, run with rust. GDScript is easy to debug for normal people, for compiled languages you need to use lldb or gdb.\n Future\n  \nbeg Godot devs for --script-dump-ast\n Better codegen (this that takes AST and makes rust source code)\n Improve the add-on.\n  \nI won't be working on this for some time. Writing a parser is only fun the first time, not 2 times + other failed attempts with parser generators. Basically, nothing will be done until --script-dump-ast, and then maybe I will continue.\n Maybe this will revive this issue.\n    submitted by    /u/ssd-guy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Godot 4.2 will still default to 6.0, but you can edit your .csproj file to change this.\n \nBelieve it or not, you can use full native AOT compilation with C# in Godot projects. That's right: no more virtual machine IL interpreting JIT nonsense. Real machine code. Interpreted languages require too much imagination.\n \n Set it up like below, and you can completely ditch the CLR runtime and its dependencies for your game and get considerable performance gains.

They knew full well that they didn't meet the system requirements, but wanted to try it anyway. Turned out the game ran pretty awfully on Proton because of their hardware, the framerate skipped wildly around, their progress kept getting wiped out, and certain textures either didn't load or popped in after several minutes.\n I had put off building for Linux until I could boot it up myself on an old PC, so I spent the day trying to debug the issue with them and figure out if there were certain settings that could improve their experience.\n In the end, we couldn't find any fixes. So I took a leap of faith, put all my chips on Godot and just blindly built a Linux version for them without testing it, figuring it probably wouldn't work but was worth a shot.\n It worked PERFECTLY, first try, no issues.\n Love this engine, love you guys. Shown above is me and the new player absolutely dumbfounded by Godot effortlessly taking care of business.\n    submitted by    /u/AuraTummyache  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the Python world, I was used to riding on the shoulders of giants. Python frameworks usually provide built-in tools for authentication—everything from password validation and encryption to token expiration and third-party logins.\n Now, as I start developing my first API with Go Chi1, I've noticed the prevalent advice is to implement features from scratch. This shift has left me anxious about potential missteps and the risk of creating an insecure application.\n Do you all build auth from scratch when using Go Chi, or are there trusted libraries you rely on? How do you manage the complexity and ensure security? \n 1 Choosing Chi over the many other \"expressive, lightweight, API router\" was already a tough dilemma (and still I don't know if I chose the right tool). I first started out with Fiber until someone told me \"I shouldn't because it doesn't use one of standard lib\" though, to be honest, I didn't really understand the reasoning.\n    submitted by    /u/Orchid_Buddy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My girlfriend (a non-programmer) recently asked me what it means when programmers say that \"everything is just binary under the hood\". I started telling her how files don't intrinsically \"mean\" something and that programs simply do something with the bytes.\n For instance, an image utility assumes that if there is a file.png somewhere and its internal binary layout follows the PNG conventions then it must be an image and it will display that image on screen interpreting the bytes as RGBA values. However, other programs may interpret these same bytes differently and do other things with them.\n To demo that concept in the most obvious way, I created snapsound - a CLI (for now) that allows you to transform any MP3 file into a PNG image but retain the ability to play back the original sound. It's as simple as\n snapsound snap song.mp3 # Creates song.png snapsound play song.png \n If you're curious, the code is completely open source on GitHub. It can be easily installed with go intall.\n As a summation of this little research effort, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it is to write a program that plays sound in Go! The only thing is, I think that github.com/gopxl/beep (one of the deps) requires CGo to build on Linux, but MacOS and Windows are pure Go, no need for anything else (already tested both).\n    submitted by    /u/sharpvik  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I've written pktstat-bpf, a simple replacement for ncurses/libpcap-based pktstat, using Linux eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) program, allowing packet statistics gathering even under very high traffic volume conditions, typically several million packets per second even on an average server. In this scenario (high volume, DoS attacks etc.) typically regular packet capture solutions start being unreliable due to increasing packet loss.\n By default it uses TC (Traffic Control) eBPF hooks with TCX attaching requiring at minimum Linux kernel v6.6 for both ingress and egress traffic statistics. Alternatively it can switch to XDP (eXpress Data Path) hook but with a consequence of losing egress statistics since XDP works only in ingress path. XDP mode due to XDP program to network interface attaching calls requires at minimum Linux kernel v5.9. Some distributions might have backported XDP/TC patches (notable example is Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel) and eBPF program might work on older kernels too.\n When using XDP on SmartNICs (100GE and more) it is possible to run in XDP Offloaded mode where XDP program loads directly on NIC with hardware XDP support and executes without using CPU, allowing wire speed statistics even on 100+Gbps speeds.\n At the end of the execution program will display per-IP and per-protocol statistics sorted by per-connection bps, packets and (source-IP:port, destination-IP:port) tuples, either in plaintext or as JSON.\n Program consists of the eBPF code in C and the pure-Go userland Golang program that parses and outputs final IP/port/protocol/bitrate statistics. Go part of the program uses wonderful cillium/ebpf library to load and run eBPF program, interfacing with eBPF map.\n I would be glad to hear about any improvements, bugs or otherwise. File an issue or ping me in the comments. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/kreatormoo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Assuming we have a vulnerable c program and we found a buffer overflow vulnerability on the program and created an exploit on that. Can the same exploit be executed if the vulnerable c program runs on a different machine? Will memory addresses be the same?\n I think the answer is no they probably won´t even be the same when running only in the same environment and on the same machine. There is nothing like a guarantee that it will have the same address.\n A modern-day OS assigns the memory arbitrarily (within certain sections of course). This technique is called Address Space Layout Randomization. Also gcc or clang uses the --fstack-protector that prevents buffer overflow attacks\n Hence, my final question confuses me and make no sense for me based on this video is how geohot manage to exploit a buffer overflow attack remotely if addresses would not the same. He first did it locally and then remotely. How does he manage to achieve it?\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dijE1JXyEA\n    submitted by    /u/stathmarxis  \n [link]   [comments]",

Im using a Brostrend A1 network adapter.\n I've put it into monitor mode successfully with 'airmon-ng check kill' + 'airmon-ng start wlan0'. I can run 'airodump-ng wlan0' (my adapter doesn't change to wlan0mon, for some reason, despite an iwconfig showing it in monitor mode). I'm able to catch all kinds of aps and clients, bssid's. \n Okay so I captured my target bssid, I then ran airodump again to find my target clients. I'm pretty sure my phone is hiding it's Mac address, because it doesn't show up under 2.4 or 5ghz packet capture. But despite that I'm sitting with my whole family and no ones showing as being kicked off when I run aireplay-ng. When I run this I've tried deauth against just the full AP, but I've also tried several device Mac addresses that are showing up. It actually runs the deauth successfully. I'm seeing ack results. But yeah despite trying maybe 5 or 6 times on different networks and devices. It'll run, but it won't kick anyone off. \n Any ideas?

I want to use this as an opportunity to upskill myself and finally break into a field that I am genuinely passionate about, and I do not mind starting from the bottom. I have enough saved that I can go at this full time, 8-10 hours a day, for the next 4 months. Importantly, I have basically no other commitments.\n I have outlined a plan:\n  \n Month 1: TryHackMe + HTB boxes with walkthrough to get the basics down and document all progress. \n Month 2: Study for and take the PNPT (can't afford the OSCP), continue with HTB and THM. \n Month 3: Renew Security+ cert and start applying for tons of jobs, keep going at it with HTB and THM. \n Month 4: Keep applying, and hopefully get some interviews, and keep doing the same stuff and document all progress. And if I get no results maybe try my luck in Bug Bounty hunting.\n  \nI know this is a massive undertaking, and I realize it's going to be a tough few months. But I've always seemed to learn quickly, and I'm very committed to making this happen.\n I would greatly appreciate any feedback, critique, and advice that could help me in my journey.\n    submitted by    /u/DimWit666  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "ctreg (pronounced cuh-tredge) is a library for compile-time regular expressions the way they were always meant to be: at compile time! It's a macro that takes a regular expression and produces two things:\n  \nA type containing the compiled internal representation of the regular expression, or as close as we can get given the tools available to us. This means no runtime errors and faster regex object construction.\n A type containing all of the named capture groups in the expression, and a captures method that infallibly captures them. Unconditional capture groups are always present when a match is found, while optional or alternated groups appear as Option<Capture>. This is a significant ergonomic improvmenet over fallibly accessing groups by string or integer key at runtime.\n  \nInterestingly, we currently don't do any shenanigans with OnceLock or anything similar. That was my original intention, but because the macro can't offer anything meaningful over doing it yourself, we've elected to adopt the principles of zero-cost abstractions for now and have callers opt-in to whatever object management pattern makes the most sense for their use case. In the future I might add this if I can find a good, clean pattern for it.\n This version is 1.0, but I still have plenty of stuff I want to add. My current priority is reaching approximate feature pairity with the regex crates: useful cargo features for tuning performance and unicode behavior, and a more comprehensive API for variations on find operations.\n    submitted by    /u/Lucretiel  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've worked in front-end web dev before, although 95% of my experience is in systems, machine learning, and gamedev as a hobby in c++, java, c#, python etc. I've definitely had an interest in doing web development and I have worked in a small team before to do a simple web app, but I found that the process was absolutely agonizing. \n ​\n Specifically, javascript seems to take my least favorite aspects of all the languages I know, and puts them together in one singular package seemingly designed from the ground up to make development as frustrating as humanely possible. \n ​\n I'm learning rust now but I consider myself a beginner still, and even though I don't think I'm quite past the initial growing pains with getting used to it, I am enjoying it and I'm all for trying out literally any alternative in existence to using javascript again. \n ​\n So as someone who knows nothing about it beyond skimming through the first page of google, do any of you actively use rust for front end? What's the current limitations? I can imagine countless benefits to using it over javascript, but are there any drawbacks to using rust for it over javascript? \n ​\n I know absolutely nothing about it, and my web dev knowledge overall is extremely rusty and likely outdated. But are you somehow working with frameworks like react but with rust? Or bindings? CSS? Any sort of generalized idea of how it works, what the experience is like and maybe some pointers on good resources for getting started would be really appreciated \n    submitted by    /u/Packathonjohn  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am currently on chapter 15 on the book, and I think I have a good understanding of the stuff I read up to that point. However, when I try to program anything real, I get very overwhelmed and can't seem to figure things out. I feel as if the libraries I see are either too abstracted to teach me anything about Rust itself, and I have to learn about the library. Or, things are complicated and I see crazy patterns that take me a long time to figure out.

Most of the interviews were 45 min affairs, solving Leetcode style problems (why ?? - that is a separate discussion).\n Sadly, I have come to realize rust is not ideal for this scenario, and going to switch back to C for these coding rounds. Most of these interviews involved working with 2D arrays, linked list, binary trees and such which would be relatively simple in C/C++.\n More context: I have had to spend a good part of the 45 min setting up these primitives, before even trying to solve the core algorithmic challenge. Few reasons:\n  \nThings like coderpad don't let you use external crates (e.g) there is one for 2D arrays\n Some questions involve removing elements from middle of lists in O(1) time. I had to hand roll a doubly linked list with unsafe pointer usage to achieve that, which itself easily filled the time\n  \nWith C/C++, these interviews used to go lot better, uh. Now I think: use C/C++ for interviews, rust for product development. Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/rusty_rouge  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's entirely written in Rust and orders of magnitude simpler than comparable ML frameworks.\n Recently we've been working on speeding up performance on Nvidia and Apple GPUs, which led us to write compilers capable of generating kernels on the fly. These kernels are compiled once and ran many times, and since the whole compute graph is known at compile time, we can get very aggressive with the kernel optimizations.\n We're adding tons more features (autograd landed a few weeks ago, so training is now possible!) so check out the blog post and the repo if you'd like to know more!\n    submitted by    /u/jafioti  \n [link]   [comments]",

As you crawl your codebase to make it async you eventually end up with an impossible task and have to find ugly alternatives (looking at you async fn in traits)\n \nwhile the rust compiler has been an amazing tool along the journey, it just fails miserably with async. It won't complain at all if you forgot to remove a blocking fs call in an async context and of course it will fail horribly at run time. And when the program eventually crashes, it will just render the most obscure stacktrace i've ever seen. FAR from the developper experience of vanilla Rust.\n \n Overall for such a great language with so many features, it just feels broken as soon as you put your finger in the async business. I ve been looking at the async improvement proposals but apart from async fn traits, i just don't see anything revolutionary that would make the experience better. \n At some point, shouldn't it just be part of the language if async Rust is to improve in a major way ? \n Disclaimer: I am not a Rust expert, but i ve been programming for 25+ years in many different languages.\n    submitted by    /u/ArnUpNorth  \n [link]   [comments]",
