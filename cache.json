          "description": "I have a few C++ projects that after a certain point I basically got stuck due to \"analysis paralysis\" or caught up in object-oriented architectural details instead of focusing on just making things work.\n C++ and the STL offer just so many different tools and object-oriented ways to do the same thing as opposed to C that's mostly a barebones structured language.\n Of course, if you want you can always use C++ without any object orientation, you can also do things \"simply\" while using C++, it's just a matter of making that decision and sticking to it throughout the duration of the project. And for me that's the problem, if I'm not forced to do things in a simple way, I know that at some point I will give in to the temptation and start using containers, templates, class hierarchies, etc. The only way to \"force\" myself to do things in a simple manner, is to just use C instead.\n Anybody else relates to this?\n    submitted by    /u/FACastello  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can always use a conditional value into the function, where one side frees and the other returns the pointer, but it's a bit cumbersome.

The vol 2 you don't normally read, but rather just skim it if you have time.\n \nI’ve only read Unix Network Programming Volume 1. But Unix Network Programming pairs very well with Volume 2 of the illustrated series.\n \nVolumes 2 and 3 are more about the actual code used to implement the protocols, so unless you're going to be writing such code (or are just curious), you can probably safely skip those.\n \n The preface to UNIX Network Programming itself claims that TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 2) is a good complimentary read:\n  \nTCPv2 contains a high level of detail very closely related to the material in this book, as it describes and presents the actual 4.4BSD implementation of the network programming functions for the sockets API (socket, bind, connect, and so on). If one understands the implementation of a feature, the use of that feature in an application makes more sense.\n  \nSo is it fair to assume that I should read TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 1), then TCP/IP Illustrated (Vol. 2), and finally UNIX Network Programming, or is that overkill?

But assuming it is, my next assertion is then: \"the world's foremost expert in c could look at my code; detect unsafe practices; and render it safe.\n And if that is all true, then I am puzzled why a machine can't do that for me (us). Isn't that something the compiler should be doing? And if that's too difficult, surely AI can be trained to know the patterns of unsafe code and require the programmer to explicitly reject the proferred 'corrections' and insist upon compiling the code as is. Isn't that what Rust basically does (e.g. permit the programmer to write in 'unsafe mode'?)\n I assume what I propose cannot be done or it already would be done. But for the life of me, I cannot figure out where my logic breaks down. Can someone help educate me why unsafe c code can't be identified by a machine (compiler or other AI code)?\n edit: 10:38: To clarify, I guess I am asking: aren't most 'unsafe practices' something that follow certain patterns that someone who has coded in c for a living for a sufficient number of years would be able to detect right away? And if there are patterns, can't those patterns be put into code for a machine to detect instead of a human? Is 'problem code' so obtuse in its potential variations that it isn't possible to articulate the patterns?\n    submitted by    /u/ill-fatedcopper  \n [link]   [comments]",

How is it, that if I declare a variable and a pointer, and I point to the variable with the pointer p = &i, obviuosly &p != p, but at the same time, if I declare an array, &a == a?\n I fear to answer my own question, but is it because the array by it selve is not a pointer but often is treatet as such? ( There is an approach to explain this technically: since &a == &a[0], because the array points to the first element, and &a[0] is the same as &a, so &a == &a, and since the & operator and the * operator cancel &a == a) \n Sorry, english is not my native language, I hope my question is still clear. \n Also I kind of think it is funny that &a, a, &a[0], *a, a[0] and &a[0][0] all point to the same address but all have different types. \n    submitted by    /u/whazzabui  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "RSGL is a versatile cross-platform graphics library designed for simplicity and convenience. It offers features like shape drawing, text rendering, and customizable widgets. With no external dependencies and a modular structure, it provides flexibility for various projects. \n Although RSGL is a graphics library, it only handles graphics data. rendering must be done externally of RSGL.h. By default, RSGL includes RSGL_gl.h which is a opengl backend for RSGL. \n RSGL also includes a small window abstraction over RGFW but you can use any windowing library with RSGL. RSGL includes an example for using RSGL with GLFW.\n Other than being very dynamic and modular in use, RSGL is also designed to be very lightweight, the current release, this includes compiled binaries, is only ~500kb and the header itself is only 120kb. \n Here is a simple example of how to use RSGL\n #define RSGL_IMPLEMENTATION #include \"RSGL.h\" int main(void) { // create a window at the center of the screen RSGL_window* win = RSGL_createWindow(\"name\", (RSGL_rect){500, 500, 500, 500}, RSGL_CENTER); // create a toggle rounded button in light mode RSGL_button toggle = RSGL_initButton(); RSGL_button_setPolygon(&toggle, RSGL_RECT(50, 125, 100, 50), 36); RSGL_button_setStyle(&toggle, RSGL_STYLE_LIGHT | RSGL_STYLE_TOGGLE | RSGL_STYLE_ROUNDED); // while the should should stay open while (RGFW_window_shouldClose(win) == false) { // loop through each event to avoid lag while (RSGL_window_checkEvent(win)) { // check button info RSGL_button_update(&toggle, win->event); } // draw a rectangle RSGL_drawRect(RSGL_RECT(200, 200, 200, 200), RSGL_RGB(255, 0, 0)); // draw the button RSGL_drawButton(toggle); // clear the screen (and render) RSGL_window_clear(win, RSGL_RGB(100, 100, 100)); } // close the window and free everything RSGL_window_close(win); } \n    submitted by    /u/Comrade-Riley  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have no idea how file streams work but I don't think it would be very hard to change that if I wanted to. \n Liberal inspiration was taken from from this post, all the heavy lifting was done there, I just added the va_arg parsing and the logic for the flags. \n Any feedback would help because I have no idea if I have taken bad approaches on this project or if the code is even readable.\n My main concern is the testing approach I have taken, I think it is pretty bad, it was tedious to wrote and is very error prone, so there might be bugs in my code I'm not even aware of.\n  \nNote: the coding convention is not my own, it is my school's, so the code will probably look very weird to most of you, I personally don't like it but that's just how it is.. \n Try not to take stylistic choices too much into consideration if you review my code but absolutely feel free to point out odd things or stuff you would not recommend doing in general. \n Here is a very brief (not exhaustive) summary of the coding guidelines I had to work with: \n  \n4 spaced tabs for indentation\n 25 lines per function max\n 80 columns max\n 5 functions per .c file max\n 4 named parameters per function max\n C89 style variable declarations\n for loops, switch case, goto are forbidden\n  \nIf you want a good laugh I can also send you the entire pdf lol.\n    submitted by    /u/ismbks  \n [link]   [comments]",

Before this, it was just a couple of simple algorithms in college, years ago. Now the program is only 50 lines long, but it introduced me to so many new concepts: pointers, error handling, streams, and standards. Jesus, standard C doesn't know about directories! Maybe I will be ashamed of this post later, but right now, I'm really proud of myself. I plan to implement more Unix utilities in the future.\n For some reason, I decided to learn C programming as my latest hobby. It can be difficult to find time in my routine, but I managed to complete \"Modern C\" by Jens Gustedt, skipping all the exercises, though. I didn't want to make the reading take forever. I wanted to experience programming at its best.\n Review my code, please:\n /* Get file name through argument and print its content to stdout. If multiple arguments provided, multiple files concatenated. */ #include <stdlib.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <errno.h> #include <string.h> #include <sys/stat.h> int print_file(char fname[]) { FILE *fp = fopen(fname, \"r\"); if (!fp) { perror(fname); return errno; } enum {BUF_SIZE = 1024}; char buffer[BUF_SIZE]; size_t read = 0; int err = 0; while (!feof(fp)) { read = fread(buffer, sizeof(char), BUF_SIZE, fp); for (size_t i = 0; i < read; ++i) { err = fputc(buffer[i], stdout); if (err) { continue; } } } if (ferror(fp)) { perror(fname); } if (fclose(fp)) { perror(fname); } return 0; } int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { if (argc < 2) { return 0; } int err; struct stat fstat = {0}; for (int i = 1; i < argc; ++i) { char *fname = argv[i]; stat(fname, &fstat); if (!S_ISREG(fstat.st_mode)) { fprintf(stderr, \"Not a file: %s\\n\", fname); continue; } err = print_file(fname); if (err) { return err; } } return EXIT_SUCCESS; } \n    submitted by    /u/TheMinus  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now, instead of all threads having to finish all of their work, I want to stop the others when one of them finds a solution and returns.\n So previously I didn't need any synchronisation, I could simply join all threads in any order in main because I would have to wait for all of them to finish anyway. But now I want to signal/message/abort/kill all the other threads when one of them returns. Because the threads are completely independent, I don't think I need any condition variables, mutexes or message queues. What I did is: have one global atomic bool running = true and set it to false in one thread when a solution is found. The other threads check for this condition in their inner loop (so, often) and return when it's false.\n This works, but is it the best solution? Polling the global bool so often seems wasteful, but is signalling/messaging a better option? And I'm not quite sure where to start.

Alot of malware killers are infecting the device, then there method of “killing” is killing any process that is statically compiled (always malware) the method used is looking in the processes maps file for strings such as “.so” & “/lib/“ to detect if a process is static, if its compiled statically they kill the process.\n My question is; why are malware owners doing this to kill other running malware? Is this a safe option killing all static processes? Are some important/crucial processes compiled statically on Linux? \n Very interested to hear your thoughts \n    submitted by    /u/ryanjones42  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's like buying a whole pizza and then throwing away 7 out of 8 slices just because you're \"not that hungry.\"\n And don't even get me started on the sheer inefficiency. In a world where every nanosecond and bit of memory counts, C is just out here throwing bytes around like they grow on trees. You might as well be programming on an abacus for all the efficiency you're getting. Think about all the extra memory you're using – it's like driving a Hummer to deliver a single envelope.\n It's 2024, people! We have the technology to optimize every single bit of our programs, but C is stuck in the past, clinging to its archaic ways. I mean, what's next? Are we going to use 8-track tapes for data storage again? Get with the program, C!\n Honestly, the fact that C still gets used is a mystery. I can't even look at a C codebase without cringing at the sheer wastefulness.

          "description": "Very memory conscious applications may consider cramming data into (usually the highest bits of) pointers. Most 64 bit systems support 48 bit virtual addresses, leaving room for a 2 bytes of data. This obviously comes at the cost of portability.\n However, if the program is aware at compile time of its maximum memory requirement (and assumes some fragmentation overhead), it should be able to restrict its virtual address space via setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS, &rlim) , ensuring a program defined number of bits in pointers are usable.\n For example, say I know my program will never use more than 6 GiB. Then its VA space could be confined to 8 GiB (33 bit addresses). This ensures I get 31 bits for data in my pointers:\n unsigned long long MAX_ADDR = (1ull<<34) - 1; const struct rlimit { rlim_t rlim_cur; rlim_t rlim_max; } r = { MAX_ADDR, MAX_ADDR}; setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS, &r); \n One specific application (that prompted the idea) are bitmap tries, where the alphabet size imposes whether the bitmap of a node can be stored within the pointer or has to be a separate field (also taking up memory due to alignment).\n Thoughts? Is this a decent idea for making tagged pointers portable or squeezing more memory?\n    submitted by    /u/_radu_b  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I've run into a problem that I can't really wrap my head around. If I try moving the cursor to the end of a line with tabs, the cursor will stop too early. Therefore, I thought maybe I should replace the tab characters for each line of the file, but then I remembered Vim. Vim can change the 'shiftwidth' of the tab character (i.e 8 spaces get turned into 2 spaces according to the shiftwidth variable) without directly affecting the line itself! So I'm wondering how I can implement this in my own program and allow the cursor to adjust to the tab size?\n For reference, here's the source code for my program if anyone's interested: https://github.com/MoolsDogTwo/Centi\n Buffer & cursor functions are in their respective c & h files.

          "description": "I'm currently writing some multi-threaded code with a client-server model-- initial thread is the server, which spawns client threads, and all interthread communication is done through the server. All threads share some global variables which are primarily used for signaling, the simplest example being a boolean flag which signals a global shutdown. Only one thread (the server) will ever write to this flag, and once set it remains set until all threads return, but many threads will read it many times in a hot loop before this happens, so I'd like to optimize those reads as much as possible.\n I'm fairly new to multi-threaded programming, but from what I've read, data races are primarily caused by one thread reading after the write has begun but before the write has finished, causing partially written data to be read. However, in this case it is a single byte being written, only one thread is the writer, only the transition from 0 to 1 needs to be detected, and that detection doesn't need to be perfectly synchronized between threads because the value will stay the same until all threads have reacted to it.\n I can't see a way that anything bad will happen if I just use a non-atomic bool, but again, I'm new to this and I don't want to introduce a subtle bug that might bite me suddenly down the line; every relevant search result I've found says to always use atomic operations by default, but they're using more complex data types. I can't imagine how a bool can ever be in a partially updated state so I feel fairly safe using a non-atomic bool, but is there something I'm missing? And if a non-atomic bool is safe, at what point does a non-atomic one-writer many-readers variable become unsafe? I imagine that depends on architecture (data bus size, etc.), so should I just assume anything larger than a bool requires atomic accesses only?\n    submitted by    /u/poorlilwitchgirl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Notice how C and C++ aren't even from the same country, yet they can do all of the same things? Regardless of their origins, because C++ was built on C, you need to write libraries in C to support the functions of C++, if you don't have the standard libraries already. Even then, some older systems with separate I/Ospace don't let you too easily write interactive (or reactive) programs for them in C; luckily you can include assembly files for them to fit your hardware.\n One key difference in C functions from their C++ counterparts is how C++ replaces the target object of a function with a pointer named \"this\". That's its actual name; the indefinite demonstrative pronoun fits for being the object of which the function is a member in C++.\n Templates aren't exclusive to C++ either; in C you can imitate them with macros, that while they may destroy type safety, can still be used for dynamic dimensionality or objects whose size is dependent on a parameter. These are, of course, object-like macros. Sadly, most folks tend to forego both object-like and function-like macros and only define simple values or even just dummies whose only purpose is to satisfy preprocessor conditions and compile code within. In fact, using object-like and function-like macros in C, I do recommend the practice of adding types as arguments for as many different types are in your functions. You can actually do that as it's only ever the preprocessor that sees them.\n C can do encapsulation too, but requires objects to be in separate files included by a \"root\" file for it, whereas C++ has classes. Members in branch files are \"private\" if instantiated and \"protected\" if static. Members in the root file are \"public\". Trouble is that even C++ hasn't a type of class whose members are \"protected\" by default.\n    submitted by    /u/Moist_Internet_1046  \n [link]   [comments]",

I do this to implement \"hot reload\" for those set of functions. It did not work at first, because myshared.c referenced functions from mylib.c, and it obviously does not have the location of those symbols when it gets hotloaded (myshared.c was not a shared object at first. It was just a standardly linked object, linked in the main step).\n As an experiment, I modified the above to be the following:\n main: mylib.o libmyshared.so gcc -o main mylib.o main.c # Made the code position idependent mylib.o: mylib.c gcc -fPIC -c mylib.c # ADDED mylib.o as dependency libmyshared.so: mylib.o myshared.c gcc -fPIC -shared -o mylib.o libmyshared.so myshared.c \n I was surprised to see that the program \"worked\" properly (though it may only be working \"by accident\"). My thought was that both main and the libmyshared.so binary would have their own in-memory copy of mylib.o and the program wouldn't work properly. That said, all of the memory is owned by the main.c code, so mylib.c and libmyshared.so does not have any state of its own.\n My questions are: 1. In this configuration, are there two copies of mylib.o at runtime (e.g. one owned by main and the other owned by libmyshared.so)? I guess the symbols are just compiled into the binary, so there is just duplicate code. 2. Would making mylib.o into a shared object remedy that problem (i.e. make it only use one copy)?\n    submitted by    /u/haskell_account  \n [link]   [comments]",

The conjecture nor the suspicion have been proven, yet.\n I made a multi-threaded C program for Mac and Linux that analyses any given number from 1 to 232 -1.

          "description": "Numberphile asked a question on Twitter and their blog (now both deleted) if anyone could help determine which five tetrahedral numbers will sum to 343867. I solved it quickly with 5 nested loops which helped him I think, although I don't think he anticipated that there were no less than 277 different working combinations, ha!\n I also made a much shorter program in Python based on itertools.combinations but it was excruciatingly slow. So I wanted to make a similar function in C, and I did. Successive calls to the function return a pointer to an array of K distinct numbers, each time the next combination in lexicographical order of an \"N take K\" set. The last call, or a call with invalid arguments, frees the memory used by the function internally.\n I implemented Donald Knuth's algorithm from his book The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4A, §7.2.1.3, algorithm T, page 359. The only thing is that his lexicographical order goes from highest to lowest number, while we usually want to process the array in ascending order, so it's only really ordered if you reverse it. That is different from the Python version and the nested loops version. Ah well.\n Let me know what you think!

The general layout of the primary data structure is thus:\n struct global_data{ float *data; struct data *table; size_t size_data; size_t size_table; }; \n where data is a table of single precision values, table is a dynamic table structure, and size_data denotes the size of the data, and size_table denotes the number of struct data structs.\n The implementation of struct data is:\n struct data{ float *data[COL]; }; \n Each data struct will represent a specific matrix of data.\n The goal is to have a dynamic table of data to work with and pass around a specific part of some data processing program; the idea is to not have to call malloc k-times and have a fragmented heap.\n What goes on is the following:\n 1) Input the number of unique matrices\n 2) Allocate all relevant data : *table by way of number of matrices; *data for the total number of matrix elements\n 3) Link *data from struct data to specific segment of *data found in struct global_data.\n This is based on the current implementation. The next implementation is to have the *data field within struct data to be dynamic: based on some k-dimensional array or arbitrary size, as determined by the user input, rather than predefined by the const definition of COL.\n The idea is to alias specific regions of some single-allocated table to pointers within another data structure, who determines the size of its own data to work with.\n What would you recommend I do to best approach this? The main issue I seem to have is the next implementation may need to account fro k-deep for loops for k-dimensional data structures. That may not be realistic. Another way is to perform algebra on the aliased pointers to access specific regions, but I'm not sure if that is the best way of approaching this problem due to the issue of readability and the increased risk of segmentation faults.\n    submitted by    /u/learnin_too_code  \n [link]   [comments]",

See for example GCC bug 107107. \n so I assume that, even though the project disables strict aliasing checks explicitly, the above pattern should remain valid even if they were enabled.\n Is my assumption correct? If not, how would one go about interpreting a region of memory as different types (e.g., when implementing file format parsers, or manipulating in-memory data structures provided by an operating system kernel)?\n EDIT: The second example is harmless, as it creates a pointer from an integer.

I want the same linked list implementation to be able to hold both function pointers and data pointers.\n Since void pointers are not allowed to be converted to function pointers in the C standard (I think since processors with Harvard architectures can store instructions and data differently?), my current solution is to create two wrapper structs, one for instruction and data pointers respectively, and then have the linked list node point to the wrapper. \n Is this the simplest way to go about things? Here are some things I thought about:\n  \nSection 2.12.3 of the POSIX standard (PDF) says that function pointers should be safely convertible to void pointers and back, but I want to make my program portable to non-POSIX systems if I can help it.\n I thought about simply having a void pointer which could either point to a data pointer or a function pointer, instead of having the struct wrapper. But I don't think this works because we would need to allocate space for the function pointer to live, and malloc only returns void pointers, so we get back to the same problem.\n I could simply having two implementations of a linked list, one that holds function pointers and another that holds data pointers, but I want to share as much code as possible.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/SereneCalathea  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I created a simple REPL in C that reads a line of input and prints it back, while saving the history of inputs entered by the user. Before you judge me as a noob (I don't mind that tbh), listen.\n Why create a stupid REPL?\n Well, creating a basic REPL that reads input until the user hits ENTER is straightforward. However, allowing the user to navigate through input history with the UP and DOWN arrow keys is more challenging because:\n  \nImmediate Input Handling: You don't get what the user typed until they hit ENTER. This is problematic because users expect the previous command to be displayed immediately upon pressing the UP arrow key.\n Raw Mode and Escape Sequences: To handle user input on each key press, the terminal input must be in raw mode. And once you're in raw mode, say bye bye to the default behavior of the terminal like CTRL+C to exit, CTRL+D to send EOF, or something as simple as backspace handling. You have to handle all of these manually. In fact, you have to responsible for writing back the character that the user types to the terminal.\n  \nYou can read more about raw mode and escape sequences in my notes:\n  \nRaw mode: https://github.com/biraj21/echo-repl/blob/main/notes/raw-mode.md\n Escape sequences: https://github.com/biraj21/echo-repl/blob/main/notes/escape-sequences.md\n  \nBtw this stupid REPL is roughly 500 lines of (probably buggy) code!\n Source code: https://github.com/biraj21/echo-repl\n Please go through the README once to understand the behaviour of history in this implementation.\n Motivation? Needed it to follow https://buildyourownlisp.com/ book, and I was unable to build the library suggested there on my Mac.\n Would appreciate your feedback.

          "description": "I'm working in embedded C. The device receives ascii text one character at a time over a serial port and I would like to recognize when certain regex patterns appear in the stream. The character rate is highly variable and there are other tasks to perform, so I can't simply block on the serial port and collect data as a string.\n What I want is something like PEARL with various rules and actions, but with a one-char-at-a-time input. And it has to play nice with other round-robin tasks.\n The goal would be to do something like stringRecognizer() in the code below. The pattern rules would be regex that are pre-compiled by the lex-generator for (e.g.) recognizing the strings \"CAT\", \"DOG\" and \"PIG\" and returning an appropriate enum value that would trigger an action.\n The function is stateful, so it knows if it has seen (e.g.) C and then A, so a subsequent T would return ACTION_CAT but an R (or anything else) would return ACTION_NOT_DONE and move on. A D would also return ACTION_NOT_DONE but move the state into the DOG rule (so CADOG would eventually trigger the DOG rule). There might be a rule to reset the state machine when a new-line or carriage-return is seen.\n I've looked at lex, flex and re2c but none provides a stateful pattern recognizer. In all cases the state machine pulls data from either a string or an input stream, but is otherwise fully blocking. When the lex() function returns (to main()) all state is lost and restarts when a new string is supplied.\n while(1) { doTask1(); // blink led doTask2(); // read a sensor if (serialInputHasData()) { char c = getch(); action_t action = stringRecognizer(c); switch(action) { case ACTION_CAT: doCatFunction(); break; case ACTION_DOG: doDogFunction(); break; case ACTION_PIG: doPigFunction(); break; case ACTION_NOT_DONE: break; default: break; } } } \n    submitted by    /u/somewhereAtC  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here are my questions : 1) in what sense is dangerous to use the gets( ) function? 2) are there some good options to actually get strings from user?, ive used scanf but it gets weird sometimes, so now tryng fgets but still sometimes act weird with stdin. Also is there a way to remove the '\\n' i get when using fgets( )?. 3) why a professor is using a function that souldnt be used from probably more than 10 years?

(Impossible)\n Sorry for bad hand writing. The idea is simple something like this:\n We give each other our public keys. You and me accomplish for two numbers (pre-partial-numbers that produce the pre-chain) and then we give each other their encrypted versions and then we have the final-chain (the protocol and client software can have common sorting and hashing as a reducer function... for example into a game card) After all each client software verifies the final chain with public keys of each peer and each peer will ensure that their pre-partial numbers are there inside and it is making the chaos for randomness because the common hasher/reducer function's hash is gonna be unpredictable.\n The fact that's providing this is that when peers encrypt their pre-partial-numbers with their private keys (RSA) there is no any pattern between them to predict and break the protocol safety. (Or there is? Idk.)\n If this whole thing is not bullshit, I will implement it in my game server.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/EvrenselKisilik  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all. So, as a challenge to myself to actually start doing projects in C, I decided to make a ncurses-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Part of the logic involves storing the current state in one matrix, and using that to build a second matrix for the next generation's state. Each cycle, the 'next state' (we'll call it m2) becomes the 'previous state' (m1), and my first implementation simply involved looping through the matrices and overwriting each cell of m1 with the corresponding cell of m2. While this works fine, I wanted to do it more \"optimally\" by simply swapping two pointer addresses. This is the function that I came up with:\n void swap_ptr(int (**p1)[ROWS][COLS], int (**p2)[ROWS][COLS]) { int (*tmp)[ROWS][COLS] = *p1; *p1 = *p2; *p2 = tmp; return; } \n The implementation looks like this:\n int matrix1[ROWS][COLS]; int matrix2[ROWS][COLS]; int (*m1)[ROWS][COLS] = &matrix1; int (*m2)[ROWS][COLS] = &matrix2; /* main loop starts, insert Life logic here to populate m2 based on the contents of m1*/ display(*m2); swap_ptr(&m1, &m2); \n This appears to be working fine, but it's not at all like the methods I found online for the same thing, which instead called for something more like:\n void swap_ptr(int ***p1, int ***p2); \n Is there something wrong with the way I'm doing it, or is this just one of those funny C things where there's multiple \"correct\" ways to do something?

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science and expect to graduate in the next six months. My background includes an undergrad degree in Computer Science and several software engineering internships. I have a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming using Java, as well as web and mobile development with technologies like React and Node.js.\n While I consider myself proficient in developing products, I’m aware that the rise of workflow automation might impact the relevance of some skills I currently possess. To stay ahead, I’m planning to deepen my expertise in C programming and explore branches such as embedded programming and advanced uses of C/C++.\n I have a decent handle on solving LeetCode problems and a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms. However, I aim to achieve a deeper understanding of programming and want to have skills that can make me a better developer and a valuable employee.\n I’m here to ask for advice and pointers from those with more experience. Should I focus on C/C++ for embedded systems, or are there other areas within systems programming I should consider? I am also taking a Computer Systems course on the side. I appreciate all the feedbacks I can get - roadmaps, youtube series, project ideas, literally anything. Thank you. \n PS - I am also trying to explore if I really like programming in C in long-term so I want to go in-depth. I can put in work but I am not sure about the path to follow. \n    submitted by    /u/No-Diet5093  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am reading the book \"The C Programming Language,\" an amazing book by the way. In the last chapter about the Unix system, there is a part about building the fopen function with system calls. In this, we use some kind of internal flags, for example, _READ instead of O_RDONLY. In the implementation, it uses both the POSIX and the internal flags. As I understand it, it uses both because in order to detect if some FILE has write privileges, for example, you can intersect bits, and if the intersection is different than 0, it has the privilege. However, this breaks when using O_RDONLY because it has the value 0, so it is not possible to detect if a combination of flags has the O_RDONLY flag with this aproach.\n So my question is, why does POSIX start with 0 instead of 1 and shift the rest by 2*n?\n (Maybe the answer is obvious, but I don't see it.)\n    submitted by    /u/vaquitson  \n [link]   [comments]",

I simply declared the return type for the main() function to be void and it compiled successfully. The changed code goes like this:\n # include <stdio.h> void main () { printf(\"Hello, world\\n\"); } \n What am I missing out from the example?

Model include a class World, a class Wordable and a class Particle\n World is just the dimensions of the world\n Wordable is a class object that is on the grid (the word), so this class manage forces, acceleration speed position and collision. Wordable is never instantiated, so this is an abstract or virtual class (if i understand correctly) Particle is one child class of Wordable , i have severals Wordable chidren because i can have different type of particle like a particle with a mass or not (photon for example), another particle class with other parameters (like TTL) and so on,\n For the coordinates system i use broadly a very simple struct Vec2D { float x; float y; auto get2D(return sf::Vector2f{x,y} -> sf::Vector2f; (get2D is used because i draw with SFML)\n i was wondering where to put this Struct ?\n at this time this struct is in particle.h. wordable.h include particle.h\n model.h include wordable.h \n mview.h include model.h \n main.cpp include mview. \n first i dont really like this because everything is included also where it's not used/ Second, if i have two or more derived classes of Wordable, i ll have to copy the struct definition in all derived classes, or create a new file with just the struct and include it in all derived classes.\n but it sounds tedious and i multiply definitions for nothing. \n What would be your strategy ? \n i'm a beginner, about 1 years of C++ but i have played a lot with classes in php and js in another life\n    submitted by    /u/Technical_Weight42    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I'm learning cpp and as an exercise I'm adapting a 'custom' template Vector class to STL vector instead of dynamically allocating arrays.\n Here's my Vector.hpp:\n #ifndef VECTORHEADERDEF\n #define VECTORHEADERDEF\n #include<vector>\n template <class T> class Vector{\n private:\n `std::vector<T> mData; // mData stored in vector` `int mSize; // size of vector` \n public:\n .\n . Constructors, getter, setter and overloaded operators (these work)\n .\n Now want to define a function std::vector<T> const& getStorage() const, that returns a const reference to mData, I can't see why my (likely naive) function doesn't work:\n T const& getStorage() const{\n return this -> mData;\n }\n It won't compile when I try to call the function (in my main.cpp). I get the error:\n ./Vector.hpp:165:16: error: no viable conversion from returned value of type 'const std::vector<double>' to function return type 'const double'\n I initially understood it as std::vector<T> and T being of the same type?\n If I instead write the function as:\n std::vector<T> const& getStorage() const{\n return this -> mData;\n }\n It does compile and run, but when I try to print the result (either in form my main, or directly from within getStorage() ) I get the error:\n invalid operands to binary expression ('basic_ostream<char, char_traits<char> >' and 'const std::vector<double>')\n So,\n What exactly is the difference between my first- and second approach?\n And why can't I do:\n std::cout << \"getStorage test: \" << vect.getStorage() << std::endl;\n (I would expect to get a print of the address of the first element of the vect. Now I'm questioning if that is even reasonable to expect)\n (Also, I've tried without progress using: const_refrence and data() (from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/vector-class?view=msvc-170#data ) But I'm not sure how to actually use them in my class)\n Any advice is much appreciated.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/jonas6000    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was not allowed to go past the memory reference operator in class however I still went ahead up until pointers. I am aware that I sorta have to go into data structures and binary trees next, however, I believe that is what we're going to cover next semester.\n Now I'm aware that I'm still very much a beginner, however, I'm able to code 99% of beginner coding projects and I'm struggling to make that jump from \"beginner\" to \"intermediate\".\n A lot of my projects are still console based so I would love to make the jump from console to GUI apps.

          "description": "Blend2D 0.11.1 has been released and regardless of the conservative version number the project is progressing and offering more features & optimizations than before.\n Blend2D started in 2015 as an experiment to use a JIT compiler for generating 2D pipelines. It was written for fun with no intention of releasing it. However, because of the excellent results it was indeed released in 2019 under Zlib license and tagged as Beta. The initial version only targeted X86 hardware in its JIT compiler, which was a serious limitation.\n Blend2D's development never stopped and during the years it got new features such as multi-threaded rendering, AVX2 & AVX-512 optimizations, dithered gradients, and even cherries such as SIMD-optimized TrueType font outlines decoding. However, the most important feature, which is AArch64 support, is now part of 0.11.1 release. It means out of box support for AArch64 based SoCs and Apple Silicon.\n Interestingly, the rendering performance is really great on Apple Silicon and in many cases it's even better against competing libraries than on X86 hardware. Results from running a Blend2D benchmarking tool on Apple M3 Pro hardware are available on the Performance page (https://blend2d.com/performance.html) together with AMD Ryzen 9 7950X dataset for comparison. Users can also run their own tests and visualize their results on the Performance page via a \"Custom Dataset\" functionality. The benchmarking tool now outputs JSON after all tests finish.\n Blend2D homepage: https://blend2d.com\n Blend2D fiddle: https://fiddle.blend2d.com\n    submitted by    /u/Asm2D    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I read the message character by character I get the expected response however it looks like the program doesn’t know where the message ends. When I extract all the characters and try to extract another it will cause the program to become unresponsive.\n So let’s say my input stream is denoted by is and my expected response is “Hi”. If I do isc;, isc; I will extract both H and I but when I call is>>c; again I get the issue. You might say “you need to check if any flags are raised” but .eof() or any of the other checkers don’t indicate anything.\n I’ve heard that istreams have their end flag raised by a terminating character, usually \\n.

For the record, i use SFML with very simple opengl shader.\n Now i try to speed up the app by using threads : on my mac i can see my application uses 100% cpu but on a mac, its 100% per cores : if you have four cores, maximum is 400%. using threads or not, i have never managed to go beyond 100% (one core) \n i can uses threads but not in //. how can i do that ?\n    submitted by    /u/SeaMathematician6660    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Finally, each of these allows for an optional boolean parameter when accessing. So the 6 accessor functions in all are:\n  \n\"access by index, optional bool\"\n \"access by name, optional bool\"\n \"access by level 1 index, level 2 index, optional bool\"\n \"access by level 1 index, level 2 name, optional bool\" \n \"access by level 1 name, level 2 index, optional bool\"\n \"access by …",

Each key (an int defined by GLFW_KEY_*) has a corresponding callback function. I would just reference the appropriate key in the map to get the function associated with that key. \n I'm having a lot of trouble getting it up. At first I created the unordered map and tried to just insert callback functions, but because they're member function of class Camera and don't have an associated object yet, and because the functions are non-static, I can't do that. So, I'm trying to use lambda functions to get the map populated. Here is the code that I have so far:\n std::unordered_map<int, std::function<void()>> cameraKeyBindings; void Camera::insertCallbackFunction(int key, void(Camera::*)() function) { cameraKeyBindings.insert(key, [this, function]() {(this->*function)(); }); } void Camera::setcameraKeyBindings() { insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_W, &Camera::linearAccelerationUp); insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_A, &Camera::linearAccelerationLeft); insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_S, &Camera::linearAccelerationDown); insertCallbackFunction(GLFW_KEY_D, &Camera::linearAccelerationRight); } \n The main problem right now is that there appears to be something wrong with the syntax:\n void(Camera::*)() \n My compiler gives this error:\n error: expected ‘,’ or ‘...’ before ‘function’\n void insertCallbackFunction(int key, void(Camera::*)() function);\n Unfortunately from what I can find, that seems to be the correct way to declare a member function pointer.

I'm sure I'm doing it wrong in many ways since I have 0 experience in the field, but at least it works for now !\n So here are my two questions :\n  \nMy program is built so I have a Node class, and every line of the source code I'm parsing is a specialization of this class (StatementNode, AssignmentNode, FunctionDeclarationNode...). I have a m_root variable as part of my Parser class, and every time I parse a line of code, I append the newly created node to m_root. Then I plan to have a to_asm() method that would traverse the tree, following each std::unique_ptr<Node> next pointer owned by each Node. The thing is, I'm not sure this is th…",

          "description": "I’m new to C++, so this may be a naive question.\n The project I’ve been working on for over one year is a very large C++ software with only one cpp file, the main.cpp. I guess there are hundreds of header files. Not really sure.\n The thing is it takes over 3 minutes to recompile, just for one small fix. I’ve seen people saying cpp/hpp implementation/interface structure is more suitable to large C++ software, so I think perhaps I should give it a try.\n But honestly I don’t know where to start. How should one approach this daunting task? I mean, it looks like in each header file, there are always over 10 header files included. So it is really hard to find a place where I can divide some piece of the header file into cpp/hpp to reduce compile time.\n And I wonder if there is some general rules for such a refactorization? \n Sorry for my limited English. English is not my first language, but I’m trying my best to make it as clear as possible. Thank you! \n    submitted by    /u/AbeL-Musician7530    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is NOT a question about the ‘wars’ (is language X ‘better’ than language Y). \n Obviously we have seen the emergence of new and improved (arguably) systems programming languages such as Rust, Zig, Nim, Go and more (and they take different approaches). \n Now, there seems to be the view that languages like Rust are in a variety of important ways and for a variety of purposes, ‘the way forward’, since they, for example, bake in memory safety and type safety, cf C and CPP. \n However, cpp has been evolving for 3 decades and is now up to cpp. \n So, my question is whether releases like C++23 have enough features in them that they allow highly experienced C++23 programmers to write safe code without necessarily having to use rust, for example?\n Again, this is not about judging whether cpp will have to yield to rust. What I’m asking is whether cpp has evolved enough, and whether it might continue to evolve enough, that it could be used as an alternative to languages like rust which come with a lot of safety features at the outset? \n Or is it a bit like a car? Modern cars have airbags and seatbelts and so on. With a very old car you can retrofit seatbelts and airbags and such but it might always be a little bit ‘hack’, since it hasn’t necessarily been engineered into the design from the bottom up?\n    submitted by    /u/anonymous_bear_6    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Catch2 works great, very simple to work with in any .cpp file. Problem is, v2 is a single header, so compilation times are obscene. (I’ve been having trouble installing or utilizing v3 and ended up giving up on the transition; I’m on Linux so this might be an issue of v2 still being around and used silently.)\n I had learned about object files a while back, but mostly just tucked them away into the mental box of “things that exist but I don’t understand when I would need them”. Now, I found a case where I need them!\n From now on, with Catch2 v2, I’m writing unit test files that #include headers with my function declarations, but I compile them to object files without linking. Thus, I’m able to go through the long compile time once per unit test .cpp file (barring future additions to such a file), and then iterate on the function definitions until the test passes, without needing to go through the long compile time whenever I update the function!\n I realize this is a fairly basic thing in anyone’s C++ journey, but it was magical for me in understanding the “why” behind some compiler features.\n    submitted by    /u/DatBoi_BP    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a private property of a class that keeps resetting itself, seemingly by magic. I have no clue why this could be happening as the property is only set to true in one place, but it is never executed more than once with this bug happening. I have looked at everything I could think of online to try to find an answer, I have tried changing the bool to an int or string and setting the values to anything else. I have stepped through the execution of my code line by line in visual studio with a watch on the property and it just magically sets itself to whatever I use as true. I made a branch of my project with this bug that can be found here: https://github.com/JordanDHayes/SDL-testing-1/tree/Broken \n The property in question is needsUpdate of the windowHandler class. It sets itself to true at the beginning of the update method in the window class after it has been set to true once before, line 105 of \"WindowHandler.cpp\". Sorry for lack of comments and the images used for testing stuff, my sense of humor is broken.

What would be the correct way to use them?\n Alternatively, I've been increasingly using extern variables and forward declarations.

I'm currently coming back to it, and I find it strange I haven't come across some nifty speed increases.\n The main thing I wish, was there to be pre-compile annotations like Lombok for Java. Yes, it's a little 'eh' but there's a deLombok feature for release builds. @Getters/@Setters are just nice. @Builders too.\n I've seen a lot of headache over \"header-only\" builds. Seems to be fine for what I'm doing. Im using Qt, so not always avoidable. A nice refactoring tool doesn't seem to be showing up anywhere though? Be nice to just have a combined file type, and let the IDE index changes and auto produce appropriate h/cpp files to avoid linker confusion down the road. \n I know C++ might get reflection in the upcoming new feature releases 45 years from now, but a lot of this could be handled like preprocessor commands I'd think.\n PS: Yes. I know I'm probably having some legacy C++ devs fuming right now. I just want to have faster development times on personal side projects.

You’ll find that the C++ language specification leaves everything wide open; it doesn’t define packages in any way. Headers just show up somehow, and the language spec doesn’t care how. As a result, every possible way of installing and finding headers and libraries is already in use, and a package manager would have to accommodate all of them. Good luck with that nonsense. Oh, and don’t forget that C++20 modules make the problem even worse.\"\n Since the OP was in r/rust (I am not the OP), I wanted to hear what cpp people thought on this, both whether rust's actual package management system could be transplanted to cpp and/or whether modules remedy the problems some/many people have with cpp in terms of headers or whether they have just made things worse.\n    submitted by    /u/anonymous_bear_6    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's more code to write obviously. It's good in terms of separation of concerns though. First get the raw string from the initial stream object (e.g. std::cin) and then do the actual extraction and validation operations on the temporary ispanstream object.\n But my question is that is this approach overkill for getting input from the user? And is it bad in terms of performance (how fast is ispanstream)?\n I know that many just don't use std::istringstream since it's got some noticable overhead. But ispanstream shouldn't have much overhead though, right?\n I'm here for opinions from everyone.\n    submitted by    /u/better_life_please    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Raw pointers and smart pointers are mixed, a bunch of int[] stuff, and the dynamic_cast stuff really make us no way to start.

The next step is changing variables. Then what to do? How to efficiently refactor the member function with no return value to a function at least return a status code and other things like forbidding RTTI?

          "description": "Hi,\n I hate to ask this question, but I need help. I need to learn C++ for a project that requires me to implement a function into existing code. I know I'll need to use classes for this. While the function itself isn't too difficult, understanding where it belongs, what inputs it needs, what it should output, and how it all fits together is the challenging part.\n I'm not an expert in programming; I'm more of a beginner. I know basic concepts like loops and data types, and I understand the idea of pointers, classes etc.. My main problem is applying these concepts correctly in different situations and internalizing them.\n I've been using learncpp.com, which I like, but it seems too time-intensive. Maybe I'm approaching it the wrong way? I read, make notes, and then try the examples. This takes a lot of time. I am on part three \"Debugging\" part. \n I then switched to studyplan.dev, which offers shorter lessons. However, it sometimes feels too superficial and lacks practical exercises. Here, I also completed Chapter 3 about classes. \n I recently discovered Codecademy's free C++ course. Would you recommend it, or do you have other suggestions? Or should I stick with learncpp and force myself to learn it this way?\n I also saw that there are some YouTube videos, and I like the concept of watching people explain things. However, I'm not sure if there are very good series on C++.\n I would appreciate any advice you can offer.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/chiefbroson    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I'm am looking for information on the way you handle your project's build targets, the best practices, what worked the best for you and your teams.\n Specifically, other than debug and release targets, do you maintain other build configuration when releasing software ? Personally, I rarely only maintain those 2 targets: I have at least a RETAIL/FINAL build, and sometimes, a test build. More than 4 targets is a pain to deal with, so I never go there. Here's the differences between them, the features they have:\n Debug build: should be for development only, not for testing. Debug version will include debug info, and no optimization;\n Release build, more specifically 'development release': does contain liited debug information (generated program database files, pdbs) but also has some degree of optimizations. The rationale of this build is that the debug build often is too big, bulky and slow to be practical when testing or reproducing a bug.\n Final/Retail : here the build has zero debug information, full optimization and for example, in visual studio, WholeProgramOptimization and link-time code generation to perform whole-program optimization. Leveraging optimizing compilers : OCs take the code that you have written and re-write parts of it in order to minimize the memory footprint, maximize execution speed, or both. Making it very hard to debug.\n Sometime, a QA build is maintained because our QA have specific needs in regards with what they need to test the software.\n What are you guys thoughts oon this ? If you also maintain a 'production' build in addition to the release buid, how to did you name it ? retail ? final ?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/zolaternative    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

My goal is to make a function which expects a std::format-like message (and eventual args), as well as a std::source_location instead of __LINE__ / __FILE__ and others implementation-defined macros for function name.\n At first, I achieved this:\n cpp log<int, std::string>(\"Hello {}, {}\"s, 42, \"world\");  Then I wondered if I could avoid specifying template types when calling it, but simply removing it fails to compile because the function has a default std::source_location as last parameter.\n So I decided to directly pass a std::format_args to the log function, here is the code: https://godbolt.org/z/dTbThPK1x Surprisingly, it successfully compiles on GCC 13.2, clang 17.0.1 and clang 18.1.0, but not in GCC 14.1, and I didn't get any warning.\n Is there some C++20 constraint which wasn't implemented in GCC 13.2 ?

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm working on a C++ library implementing a heuristic algorithm for the Set Covering Problem: github.com/c4v4/cft\n The SCP is a classic combinatorial optimization problem that asks, given a set and a collection of subsets, to find the minimum-cost group of subsets that covers everything in the original set. You can find SCPs in crew scheduling or test selection, for example.\n Currently, commercial MILP solvers like Cplex or Gurobi are often the go-to option for SCPs. But, while they are powerful, well-designed heuristics can often achieve even better results (especially when the available time is tight).\n Our implementation is based on the work of Caprara, Fischetti, and Toth. It was originally developed for a research project, but we've decided to clean it up and make it publicly available as a free, high-performing alternative.\n We also hope the library serves as a helpful companion to the original paper, which can get a bit technical at times.\n Since this is our first real open-source contribution, any constructive feedback is welcomed. We hope this library will prove helpful.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/__c4v4    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I get the whole paradigm about having a completely valid, initialized object as soon as it comes into being via the \"resource acquisition\".\n However, it seems to me that this is the much less important part of RAII. The more imporant part being: objects out of scope release their resources automatically. \n The destructor releasing the resources (e.g. a lock_guard releasing a mutex) is much harder to get right because releasing it manually would have to occur at the end of the scope. Conversely, if we weren't allowed to use a constructor, it wouldnt be as hard to manage, because the initialization would usually follow closely after the resource allocation. \n Consider the following example: \n int fun() { SomeBigObject* o = new SomeBigObject(); // assume empty constructor // 1. Initialize o->name = \"someName\"; o->number = 42; // ... // 2. Stuff happens, maybe early return, maybe exception delete o; // 3. Missing this is much more consequential! } \n Now lets assume SomeBigObject does have a more useful constructor, with the initalizations I made to be done there, but no destructor. Taken literally, you would have \"acquired the resources\" and \"initialized them\" with only a constructor - even though this is not what is generally understood by RAII, which usually entails the destructor that does the cleanup when something goes out of scope.\n ​\n  \nAm I missing something or is there another good reason that I'm missing?\n Why couldnt the committee think of a better name? It confused me a lot in the beginning. I think something like \"Ownership & Valid intialization as a class invariant\" or something.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Gay-B0wser    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I am a person who recently joined their first company a couple months ago. The role is decent, the pay is great… but the tech is outdated. We are still on C++17 at my firm and while I have learned some things during my time at this company, my company is in an industry where low latency programming is really important, and when I interviewed for other companies in the industry, they made it abundantly clear that expertise of C++20 and above is crucial for the industry.\n I would like to get more modern C++ programming experience while I stay in this role so that I have some job mobility in case my future in this company goes awry. For those of you in jobs where the tech is behind, how do you manage to keep up? I’ve started reading some books on modern C++ programming and I’ve been trying to find open source projects to work on, but I haven’t really found many projects online that make use of a lot of the modern C++20 syntax (e.g. concepts, ranges, even older stuff like CRTP). Would appreciate any input!\n Edit: think there are people dming me with the assumption that I’m just a beginner who just started cpp programming. Listen, I don’t claim to know everything but I’m not a dumbass either (so don’t patronize me), I am really just looking to get more experience working with implementing real systems with more modern (++20 and above) C++. I work in the trading industry, which is why I bring up C++20 specifically as that’s become standard with other competitors but is not largely available in the firm I work with yet.\n    submitted by    /u/Short_Memory_72    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Writing everything in a single file becomes difficult to maintain.\n I've tried splitting systems into different CPP files, but I often need the same function or variable in multiple files. When I use header files, I encounter multiple declaration errors, even with #pragma once. I also attempted to use the MVC pattern, but I faced similar issues. I can't seem to create a generic loop in the main file that can pass and receive data from the MVC modules without including the same header in different files, which again leads to multiple declaration errors.

Can any experienced programmers tell me a bit about where you might implement std::shared_future in your program?

Starting in September, I will be pursuing a CS MSc. I'm no longer interested in the Data Science path, but rather in software development, particularly algorithms (this was the most stimulating part of my bachelor's education) or trading (I had a Finance minor). I want to regain my proficiency.\n Currently, I'm reading \"C++ Crash Course: A Fast-Paced Introduction\" to refresh my knowledge while also studying introductory material about derivatives. After that, I plan to dive into Leetcode and \"Cracking the Coding Interview.\" I also have \"Algorithmic Trading\" by Ernest Chan in mind for when I get back to a good level of coding.\n However, I keep wondering: how deeply should I delve into C++, especially regarding the new versions? Do you have any tips or reading material you think I should check out to achieve my goals? I would be grateful for any help.\n    submitted by    /u/ExternalPin203    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I have a project where I am using almost every type of thermocouple probe connected to a micro controller. If you don't know how thermocouples work, essentially it's a simple device of 2 wires being welded together, and at specific temperatures they output a known voltage. \n This is commonly used for temperature measurement, as you can measure the voltage to get temperature (simplified). In order to know the temperature based off of the voltage you must have the table that corresponds the voltage and temperature. Since this table is just temperature to voltage, its 2 columns. However the tables sometimes have 1500+ rows.To add to the pain, I haven't been able to find a text file of these tables, only PDF formats. \n What would be the fastest way to implement these tables into memory and search through one column of data to find the corresponding data point. I was thinking a 2D array using binary search (since the tables are already sorted).\n    submitted by    /u/FridayNightRiot    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

In section 2.4 it goes off imediatley showing a code I practised alot and understand how it works but then soon shows how we can make it work with the void function.\n The code (Int):\n include <iostream>\n int getValueFromUser() { std::cout << \"Enter an integer\"; int input; std::cin >> input; return input; }\n int main() { int num{ getValueFromUser() }; std::cout << num << \" Doubled is: \" << num * 2 << '\\n'; return 0;\n  \nPretty straightforward right? You're making the code prompt you to enter an integer and then it will double the the number.\n Example:\n 4 Doubled is: 8\n But then the tutorial brought that one back again and decided to make it work with the void function.\n include <iostream>\n int getValueFromUser() { std::cout << \"Enter an integer\"; int input; std::cin >> input; return input; }\n void printDouble(int value) { std::cout << value << \" Doubled is: \" << value * 2 << '\\n' }\n int main() { int num { getValueFromUser() }; printDouble(num); return 0; }\n  \nMy biggest annoyance here is why are you trying to make me do 50 extra steps to a code I already got good at, no wonder i'm confused on how your explaining things.\n Any better tutorial so I don't have to deal with this?\n    submitted by    /u/Ko938AUp    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

On paper it seems straightforward but I am trying to pinpoint if my problem is with the understanding of what exactly is a map iterator and what exactly I am passing. With regards to my uni textbook, it does not cover maps.\n To my understanding, a map is composed of a pair struct where first is the key and the other is the value. In order to go through the whole map I need the iterator for the first element and the last element and I can get those via map.begin() and map.end() and an iterator can be progressed via the ++ operator. I am trying to protect my map by encapsulating it in a class thus an iterator class is the only way for me to go through the map. Now I am confused as to what exactly I should be passing when I am iterating and how I can control access of the iterator so as not to expose my map.\n    submitted by    /u/towerbooks3192    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi. I'm working as a C++ dev, and there's a pattern that's everywhere in my company's codebase. But I'm still quite early in my career so tbh it has my doubting myself. I thought this violated strict-aliasing rules so was undefined behaviour, but with how much I'm seeing it in our code it has me doubting myself. As this is written by people with a lot more experience then me.\n If you have a char* or uint8_t* you've read off a socket or character device:\n char buffer[512]; // or std::uint8_t buffer[512] // imagine we're reading from a device or socket into the buffer here... // then later: const std::uint32_t *ptr = reinterpret_cast<const std::uint32_t*>(buffer); const uint32_t n = ntohl(*ptr); // etc... \n I don't see -fno-strict-aliasing in our compiler flags either. But I thought that while you can cast a pointer to any type to a char/uint8_t pointer, it doesn't work the other way round. The compiler is free to optimise based on that assumption, not to mention issues with alignment, caching etc. \n If I'm wrong can someone explain where how? I may have misunderstood aliasing rules.

To name just a few:\n  \nstd::optional<bool> doesn’t compile\n std::optional<NonDefaultConstructible> doesn’t compile\n std::visit is broken\n std::variant::operator = will silently mess things up by setting the wrong index\n std::unordered_set::extract will return a handle that when destroyed decrements the number of elements in the collection. So one extract causes two sides decrements.\n  \nFortunately, the last version of C++ Builder seems to be moving away from Dinkumware, but until I upgrade, is anyone here aware of a broader list of Dinkumware bugs?

For example there is MPI, but it is huge and complex. For certain people (me) this is a problem.\n For example, you might want to create a small program that does a lot of things. If you need to include only a few large components, like a compression lib, a message-passing lib, maybe a XML/JSON parser, and each one takes 1MB, now you have a 3MB program, but your code might only take 50KB.

          "description": "Right, so I know Qt exists, but I'm not entirely sure how sensible relying on it would be. The key point is that I definitely don't need a gigantic swiss army knife GUI framework, I only need the basic stuff - simple layout, a couple of basic widgets, rudimentary window support. Think basic Win32 - toolbars with buttons, menus, some configuration windows with lists and checkboxes, that sort of stuff. Having \"native\" looking UI (whatever that means these days) is of no concern.\n The important visual bit of the program is going to be a vector based data visualizer and it needs to be very snappy, have very clean looking rendering and very smooth zooming. That's the most challenging bit, I think. As for basic GUI, I've actually made a basic sketch of a GUI builder of sorts a while ago in Lua (just by relying on the existing pixel drawing function and font rendering) and I didn't find it overly difficult.\n The main issues are that I'm unfamiliar with Cpp (I do have some experience with C, I still remember it fairly well), and I'm going to be developing on Windows while having no idea how much work it'll take to build and distribute it on OSX until I've actually progressed a good deal.\n As far as general GUI multiplatform development goes... I dunno, I've spent a great deal of time researching the subject and it seems that no silver bullet exists, not even remotely. Every option has serious cons and issues. Qt, Java, countless web-based frameworks, and then of course every language has its cons too. For instance, I've been tinkering with Dear PyGui lately (Python bindings for ImGui) and Python doesn't seem to have a good distribution system to end users.\n    submitted by    /u/abir_valg2718    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I am updating a very old C codebase to a modern C++ approach. But this process is not straightforward. This means I cannot transform the C code right away into modern C++ with unit tests and all the code quality tools I would like.\n As long as I'm grooming it up, I tend to make mistakes. Namely I refactor the code before I functionally replace the old code with a modern C++ approach. For instance, I replace statements like\n anOldCStruct->memberfield->memberfield2->value = x; anOldCStruct->memberfield->memberfield2->value2 = y; anOldCStruct->memberfield->memberfield2->value3 = z; \n into \n auto* memberfield2 = anOldCStruct->memberfield->memberfield2; memberfield2->value = x; memberfield2->value2 = y; memberfield2->value3 = z; \n but I run into problems with boolean variables, as I mistakenly remove negative logic ! without noticing. We have pull requests and these mistakes are also not detected, so double human problem here.\n That's why I'm asking this: before I can go full unit testing, does anybody know if there's any tool that can detect from git commit to git commit the change of boolean logic that it's \"easy\" to miss if you're a human but not if you're a computer?\n    submitted by    /u/somecucumber    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As you know, one of the main gripes with C++ development is related to compilation time. Compiler vendors constantly strive to make improvements in this area, in spite of new STL features being constantly added. C++26 is going to be quite special in this regard though afaik, having the reflections proposal accepted. Reflections being probably the biggest metaprogramming extensions ever added to the language, even bigger than concepts and require clauses.\n I'm saying this because I was watching this particular talk by Alexander Fokin describing it: https://youtu.be/FqzrQf6Xr8g?si=oe6L0askoOzQjSlC&t=3592 . What immediately caught my attention was the example of how you could implement std::tuple (almost fully) in what? 20 lines of code? For reference, MSVC's implementation is a header with more than 1000 lines of code ( https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/main/stl/inc/tuple ), containing dozens of helper class template instantiated for each instance of std::tuple used in real code. A fair assumption would be that the std::meta version would be far faster to compile, reflections being a very straight-forward way of expressing your intent to the compiler. In real life scenarios this could results in an immense amount of time saved at compilation time. And better yet, the opportunity of rewritting std::tuple would be a big bonus too since none of the standard implementations are optimal ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ilujab/it_turns_out_stdtuple_is_not_a_zerocost/ ).\n Again, I'm not talking just about std::tuple here, I'm assuming there are dozens of STL components that could use being rewritten using reflections, if for nothing else, at least for the sake of compilation time. I'm wondering if this new feature couldn't be the push vendors have needed to take into consideration a real ABI break with one of their future releases, considering the compilation time improvements now available on the table. \n    submitted by    /u/cristi1990an    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

The code I've written wasn't the kind that focused on being ultra optimized. Instead, the focus was moreso on readability and reliability. We usually are not allowed to use most modern C++ features. Our coding standard is often described as \"C with classes.\"\n I have an interview coming up for a low latency position that also involves distributed systems. What would this kind of C++ development entail compared to what I'm currently doing?\n In other words:\n  \nWhat are some high level concepts I might want to familiarize myself with before the interview?\n \nMore broadly speaking -- if, against all odds, I manage to land the position, what new skills might I be learning? What might I need to study up on in my own time? What would my day to day development look like? How might this differ from the development of an embedded software engineer?\n \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/boreddolphin98    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

To me it seems obvious what it should expand to, for example if Is = 0, 1 and Tuples = Tuple1, Tuple2, Tuple3, then it should expand to:\n std::is_void_v<invoke_at_result_t<0, F, Tuple1, Tuple2, Tuple3>> || std::is_void_v<invoke_at_result_t<1, F, Tuple1, Tuple2, Tuple3>> \n It is stranger that the code compiles with Clang or GCC.

Please tell me it is restricted.\n  \nI'm currently working for porting existing libraries like magic_enum, fastgltf and etc (which are used in my private module based projects). Changing dependencies with module is quite easy and giving me much benefits for compile time.\n During porting, I'm curious about which folder is the proper location for module port file (which ends with .cppm or .ixx extensions). At first I think src or module is the answer, because it is not header file and cannot be included. However, I realized that package managers like vcpkg does not install files in those folders, but compile the sources files to static/shared libraries (which ends with .a or .so extensions).\n Some module supporting libraries like Vulkan-Hpp and glm locates the module file in include directory. In this case, vcpkg install the header files to include directory and user can fetch them using ${glm_SOURCE_DIR}/include/glm/glm.cppm to declare module target.\n There are many package managing strategies that are preserving file structures, but I think CMake + vcpkg is the de facto system for C++ developers, so I'm confusing about the proper module exposing method.

          "description": "Hi Everyone,\n I've written a tool at the company I work at that basically allow you to autogenerate any boiler plate code based off a yaml file and a Jinja template schema. At work, we use to tool to autogenerate C++ classes that have built in serialize/deserialize functionality for all kinds of different message classes that we work with. I've also written templates that can autogenerate Protobuf converters that convert a C++ message object to its protobuf equivalent. This has been super handy for us because we work with many different C++ message classes and hand typing all the converters would be tedious and error prone. \n My question is: I am debating making this tool open source, but want to see if other people who write C++ encounter similar problems to this and if a tool like this would be valuable and helpful before I spent a bunch of time re-working it and making it available on GitHub. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ndelgado1    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Log function essentially does this:\n std::cout << std::format(\"{}\\t\\t{}\\n\", LogTypeToString(type), vformat(fmt, args));\n The displaying of the text:\n constexpr auto renderTextSize = sizeof(renderer); Log(LogType::Info, \"{:*^{}} OpenGL Information {:*^{}}\", \"\", 16 + renderTextSize, \"\", 16 + renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, \"* Version : {} ({}.{}) {:{}} *\", version, glVersion[0], glVersion[1], \"\", 26 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, \"* Vendor : {:{}} *\", vendor, 52 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, \"* Renderer : {:{}} *\", renderer, renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, \"* GLSL Version : {:{}} *\", glslVersion, 52 - renderTextSize); Log(LogType::Info, \"{:*^{}}\", \"\", 76 - renderTextSize); \n As you may see, since the renderer text seems to be the longest by nature I'm trying to use that as the complete width so that this box shape using \"*\" is always just a space ahead and everything else meets it. I got it to look good with my settings, but I'm wondering how it would look if my information was different. Something tells me it wouldn't make a nice box.\n  \n[Info] ************************* OpenGL Information **************\n [Info] * Version : 4.6.0 NVIDIA 552.22 (4.6)\n [Info] * Vendor : NVIDIA Corporation\n [Info] * Renderer : NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Laptop GPU/PCIe/SSE2 * [Info] * GLSL Version : 4.60 NVIDIA [Info] **********************************************************\n  \nEDIT: It's hard to get it to display here, but basically the first line makes as many \"*\" to the length of the Renderer: text. So that it would complete the so-called \"box.\"\n That's how it displays in the console. Currently, everything is designed with my own hardware information in mind, but I'd like to make it dynamic.Thanks, and have a great day.\n    submitted by    /u/TuteTatoons    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Dangerous languages perhaps, but languages that know they are dangerous, and document exactly where the sharp edges are located.\n However, for about a year and a half, I've been branching out and it appears to me that every single language and technology I look at has behaviors that are not defined. They just don't admit to it.\n I opened an issue in docker's documentation because they were missing an explanation for a behavior. Closed as resolved with, paraphrased, \"read the repository if you want to know how docker works.\"\n By that standard, C++ doesn't have undefined behavior either! Just read your compiler's source code and you'll know what happens.\n Same problem with Microsoft's Azure cloud services. Many guides and tutorials but no authoritative source that explains how Azure works, what each option does, and how they interact - or if there is, it's sufficiently burrowed that I've been unable to find it after searching for a while, and their representatives cannot guide me to it either. Dotnet projects? Same issue again, there's any number of properties you can set for your project and you just have to guess from their name what they will do - and don't get me started on the difficulty of writing provably correct golang.\n  \nI can sign for the correctness of C/C++ software. I might be wrong because mistakes happen, but those are mistakes, not lies.\n I cannot sign off on most other software. If I claim that I know something is correct, I am lying. I don't know. I'm guessing. \"It worked so far.\"\n  \nI can write software in all these languages, use all these other technologies. I cannot do engineering with them.

This leads to strange inconsistencies in different UIs which might confuse users. Is GTK still the best option for performance reasons? Or does QT have better performance too?\n Finally there's wxWidgets. They compile to native toolkits on every platform, so it's probably the best for native look and feel.

          "description": "I recently came across this neat ErrorOr pattern, while looking through SerenityOS, which works like this:\n ErrorOr<Foo> GetFoo() { return Foo{}; } auto foo = TRY( GetFoo() ); \n The ErrorOr<T> is simply a wrapper around their own variant type (exactly like std::variant as far as i can tell) with is_error, release_error, release_valuefunctions as alternatives to std::holds_variant, and std::get.\n The only thing that im not a big fan of is the way that the TRY macro is implemented (simplified):\n #define TRY(expr)\\ ({\\ auto&& tmp = (expr);\\ if(tmp.is_error())\\ return tmp.release_error();\\ tmp.release_value()\\ }) \n which only works because of GCC statement expressions (and apparently also works on clang but definitely not on msvc)\n I was wondering if anybody knew of a standard compliant way to implement this maco? Or a msvc equivalent implementation that i could just switch over to when compiling on msvc?\n    submitted by    /u/StandardPreference    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can write some_class{}.print_hello(); and it will write out \"Hello\", but I thought this was not allowed because print_hello() is trying (successfully) to use a function declared below it. \n Could someone help me understand when and why something must be declared before it can be used? \n    submitted by    /u/LemonLord7    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Its development team recently wrapped some of its functionality as an unmanaged dll for us so that we can incorporate it into our aspnet based microservice application. Currently we are using .net's foreign function interface (PInvoke) to call the library, however it is a bit fragile and we have to meet a few odd requirements like using a thread with a non-standard max stack size.\n I am thinking maybe I should wrap the api calls in a separate program (probably written in c++) to execute c++ calls that I will run in a separate process and use ipc to communicate. This will probably be a bit more robust as I can recover from process crashes and do not need to implement a producer/consumer queue with a separate thread etc. to schedule api calls. However I also feel like I am overcomplicating things. Did any of you had to deal with a similar problem?

QStringLiteral(\"\") : QStringLiteral(\"%1 id: _%2\\n\").arg(m_indenSpace).arg(getId(item))); return true; \n } ``` %1 -> name of the field %2 -> id of the field %3 -> background color %4 -> indentation space %5 -> generation of the QML id (based on item id)\n Do you have any solution or tips: could be a way to organize or even some libraries…\n https://invent.kde.org/renaudg/rolisteam/-/blob/master/src/binaries/rcse/qmlgeneratorvisitor.cpp?ref_type=heads\n    submitted by    /u/ObiLeSage    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sometimes there's version conflicts and such, but that's not what I'm talking about here. In Python: pip install; in JS: npm install; in Rust: add it to Cargo.toml; Java: POM File. These are what I worked with, and I know there's other ways to do it in each one, but still, it's basically \"hey, I need to use this\" \"ok\". But with cpp, every single time I've had to deal with some dependency it's been a huge effort to try and relearn cmake, or having to go manually after library files, have compilers screaming at me that it can't find something that's RIGHT THERE. \n So, what's the deal?

I believe everything is being copied right now so I'm not working with the original object which causes them to constantly be deleted and not be rendered on screen so to fix this I just need the maps to store a smart pointer and the load functions return a smart pointer?\n For future reference is there a way to remember this sort of stuff for example whenever an object is needed outside the scope should I be working with pointers?\n    submitted by    /u/Konjointed    to    r/cpp_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Raptor provides a set of smart containers (vector, array, vector, scalar) and skeletons (map, reduce, scan, filter, sort) that can be applied over the smart containers. Containers can store the data both on the host (CPU) and device (GPU), and expose a seemingly unified memory address space. Skeletons are executed on the device. Containers are automatically and lazily allocated and synchronized whenever a skeleton is executed.\n    submitted by    /u/dma_snow    to    r/cpp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just add some sync.Mutex at critical places? It adds a little overhead timewise though not critical. A more elegant approach is to send all this data back to main using a channel?

These interface definitions are not stable since they are broken every time a service adds a new operation.\n Usage of *iface should be replaced by scoped caller-defined interfaces for the service operations being used:\n // V1 import \"io\" import \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3\" import \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3/s3iface\" func GetObjectBytes(client s3iface.S3API, bucket, key string) ([]byte, error) { object, err := client.GetObject(&s3.GetObjectInput{ Bucket: &bucket, Key: &key, }) if err != nil { return nil, err } defer object.Body.Close() return io.ReadAll(object.Body) } // V2 import \"context\" import \"io\" import \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3\" type GetObjectAPIClient interface { GetObject(context.Context, *s3.GetObjectInput, ...func(*s3.Options)) (*s3.GetObjectOutput, error) } func GetObjectBytes(ctx context.Context, client GetObjectAPIClient, bucket, key string) ([]byte, error) { object, err := api.GetObject(ctx, &s3.GetObjectInput{ Bucket: &bucket, Key: &key, }) if err != nil { return nil, err } defer object.Body.Close() return io.ReadAll(object.Body) } \n My Thoughts\n I understand why AWS does not want to maintain a separate interface package in v2. Their reasoning is that they break whenever something is added. However, I thought the interfaces were very simple and convenient to use.\n I also know that Go prescribes defining interfaces where you actually consume, however, the AWS methods are always very verbose and when I copy the methods that I use I have to remove the named parameters when converting. Overall, feels like a worse DX to me, but that comes with the go territory. Does anyone else have thought?\n    submitted by    /u/whatswiththe  \n [link]   [comments]",

(This is still a work in progress, and currently does not output 100% accurate results).\n It can be found on SourceHut and I would appreciate if anyone takes a look and shares back some feedback.\n    submitted by    /u/habarnam  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are loosely following hexagonal architecture. On the JVM, I would creat multiple modules that then have their package structure like app-a/domain, app-a/adapters, app-b/domain etc where app-a is the module.\n Currently, I have something close to this:  ❯ tree . ├── db │ ├── migration │ │ └── 000.sql │ ├── sqlite.go │ └── store.go ├── discord │ ├── client.go │ └── message.go ├── domain │ ├── filter\\_test.go │ ├── filters.go │ ├── import\\_matches.go │ ├── match.go │ └── store.go  where db, discord and domain are separate packages.

I had experience using echo, so this was the one I chose.\n These types needed to be inferred, they would not be explicitly given in any way. You are not allowed to use any api generation tools like swagger or blueprint.\n Overall, I was unable to complete the challenge the way they wanted, I wrote a solution where the user needed to pass req and resp types when registering a handler.\n Looking at it now, this is as far I as can get. I'm assuming you would need to call the function and and use reflection on the response to know its type, but im still really uncertain as to how to properly call this handler function without knowing the request type.\n https://go.dev/play/p/OH5V1cR43FZ\n I'm at my wits' end, so any help would be greatly appreciated.\n edit:\n After long discussions with helpful people in this forum, its clear this coding challenge was disingenuous. A solution would rely on this theoretical api server's documentation strategies. E.g. one could expect to pull this information from struct tags (if the server was implemented in go).\n This wasn't a coding challenge, this was the company looking for a solution to a problem they had, and got free labor in the process.

I don't remember seeing it in the books I read so far (I read the 100 common mistakes and the Effective Go books).\n I inherited some application and had many problems with properly shutting things down. There was always something that 'stuck' or lived after it shouldn't have... After going a few circles I introduced a rule that is summarized as\n  \nfunctions should be synchronous\n if they need to start multiple goroutines to do stuff in parallel, they are free to do that\n but they need to wait until those routines terminate.\n  \nI also introduced contexts where the previous guy was a bit lazy, and this thing emerged as a pattern. I can be sure that things are properly shut down when the function returns to the caller. There are no more 'ghost effects' from go routines of the 'past'.\n Since I started doing this my thinking about handling gorutines completely changed, and I often spot the lack of it in others' code, then immediately see that they don't have the same guarantees about ghosts and termination that I have.\n Sometimes this is a bit hard to do, for example when dealing with Reader.Read() in a goroutine. Because Read() doesn't have context and can block for unbounded time. But I always have this ichy feeling that this is somehow bad and figure out a way to make the function behave well (to my standards). I tend to follow it especially within our codebase.\n We do mostly backend stuff, my experience with go is limited to that subject.\n I call this 'leave no goroutine behind', but it might have a name already.

My database still has a schema; the schema is just shifted from SQL table definitions over into the code itself. If I change the format of a struct representing the document in a collection or add a relational field to another collection, previous records in the DB need to be updated to reflect this, or I end up with bad data.\n Right now I'm handling this with a function for each migration step. Each migration has an ID associated to it and I keep a migrations collection with the timestamp when this migration was run (if it was run). This way I don't have to rerun any previous steps. I'm trying to make each one idempotent, so even without the migration collection, they could potentially run again if needed. The \"migrations\" collection is just for performance purposes, to avoid having to run all historic migrations every time the app starts.\n I've been reading about the various SQL DB migration tools, and declarative state based migrations vs functional time-series migrations. The latter sounds roughly like what I'm doing.

I have been also using AI as a consultant or a tutor, (I enjoy programming , I'm not using AI to generate code. You can't learn it that way anyway, and learning it is my main objective) and let me say that is also an amazing tool. Anytime I am unsure about something I just ask the AI and it clears it up. What a great time to learn a new language. I've been having some trouble grasping interfaces, but it's not like I must understand them right now. I'm not a newbie. C was my first language, then Python, C#, a bit of Java, bash, batch, and I used Visual Basic a long time ago, but I usually don't mention that. I welcome any tips you guys may have that could help me understand it even better. I primarily intend to use it for CLI, and web applications.

I've seen in the documentation that you should always reuse the clients in order to take advantage of existing HTTP connections. At first, that looks pretty straight forward: initiate a new client at start time, attach it to the server struct and access the client from anywhere, like a singleton.\n Now, say I have a Gitlab client that sends requests on behalf of an user which has provided an access token. I cannot initiate the client at start time and reuse it (setting the token before calling the api) because I could have race conditions where an user ends up with the token from someone else, so sharing an authenticated client seems like a no go. \n I think I could create a client per http request, making it unique per client, but then if I only make one call to gitlab per request it's the same thing as never reusing the client.\n Do I make sense?

The position was a Golang position (which I admittedly have no experience in) but the assignment did not have to be written in Go. I decided to write it in Go anyways because:\n  \nI would need to learn the language if I were to be hired for the position anyways.\n \nIt would be nice to learn a new language and it's ecosystem even if I were to be rejected.\n \n So I poured my heart into learning Go and some select frameworks. I honestly thought I did well enough on the assignment considering it's my first real attempt to write something in Go that isn't absolutely trivial. I was not given any feedback for where I went wrong so I'm left in the dark here. Can any of you give me some feedback on my code? Really appreciate the time.\n https://github.com/brandonto/rest-api-microservice-demo\n EDIT:\n I'd like to thank you all for the enormous feedback. It's heavily appreciated. Never thought that I would have received so much in such a short time frame. I think I have a clear understanding of where the weak points lie now for future projects. I'll definitely be incorporating some of the suggestions in future projects. Perhaps even make changes to this one for the sake of completeness.\n As for the job, while I am a bit disappointed after sinking in hours into this project, I'm just treating it as part of the learning experience.\n I probably won't have the time to respond to any new comments.

We are excited to announce pgml, our official Rust SDK for PostgresML, and the rust_bridge, the crate we the crate we utilize to generate our JavaScript, Python, and now C SDKs from our Rust SDK.\n We have had the SDK available on GitHub for a while now, but this marks its official release on crates.io. \n Maybe more interesting for some of the community is the rust_bridge crate (docs still in progress). The rust_bridge exposes a series of macros and traits that can be implemented to translate vanilla Rust into py03, neon, and C compatible Rust. For those interested we have a writeup on How We Generate JavaScript and Python SDKs From Our Canonical Rust SDK. We recently added C into the rust_bridge and are working on interop with additional runtimes, like Go, JVM, and Beam.\n We wanted to thank the community for all the effort that gets put into OpenSource Rust and are hoping that our contributions will be helpful!\n Let us know if you have any questions, stay awesome. \n    submitted by    /u/smarvin2  \n [link]   [comments]",

This app would need some SQL stuff, not too much desktop integration.\n The main reason to no develop a simple web It's avoid using servers.\n Right now I'm good with typescript and react. Also python but I think it won't be useful for that.\n I don't know rust, but I don't mind to learn.\n \n My first thought was about electron, some apps I use are made with electron, it's widely used and fits my language knowledge, but, maybe it's a bit bloat, some of the apps I use are slow even for \"simple\" purposes. Also bundle size could be close to 200M for a simple text editor. Apps like VSCode are very optimized despite that, but I'm not Microsoft,\n So I saw Tauri, It looks great, even made my first \"hello world\" app in twenty minutes, but I cannot find serious projects using this technology. Most of the stuff I found are simple hobby projects abandoned a couple of years ago.

After finishing rustaceans I decided to try implementing a binary tree.\n I struggled a lot trying to get the borrows right, and compiler screamed a lot at me especially when I tried to hold multiple mutable references (forgot they are exclusive).

I think a lot of that came from trying not to drop or move a Box, hence the `ref mut`s. Could you mind giving me some guidance? What can i do to make this more idiomatic?\n #[derive(Debug)] pub struct Node<T> { pub value: T, pub left: Option<Box<Node<T>>>, pub right: Option<Box<Node<T>>>, } impl<T> Node<T> { fn new(value: T) -> Self { Node{value: value, left: None, right: None} } } #[derive(Debug)] pub struct BinaryTree<T> where T: PartialOrd { pub root: Option<Box<Node<T>>> } impl<T: PartialOrd> BinaryTree<T> { fn new() -> Self { BinaryTree { root: Option::None } } fn is_empty(&self) -> bool { return self.root.is_none(); } fn insert(&mut self, value: T) { if let Some(ref mut node) = self.root { let mut node = node.as_mut(); loop { if value < node.value { if let Some(ref mut child) = node.left { node = child.as_mut(); } else { let new_node = Box::new(Node::new(value)); node.left = Some(new_node); break; } } else if value > node.value { if let Some(ref mut child) = node.right { node = child.as_mut(); } else { let new_node = Box::new(Node::new(value)); node.right = Some(new_node); break; } } else { break; } } } else { let new_node = Box::new(Node::new(value)); self.root = Some(new_node); } } } fn main() { let mut my_tree = BinaryTree::<i32>::new(); my_tree.insert(5); my_tree.insert(7); my_tree.insert(3); my_tree.insert(10); println!(\"{:?}\", my_tree); } \n    submitted by    /u/etzellux  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Link to the crate\n I created this tool after having tried to bisect some rustc bugs a while ago, and discovering that there wasn't an easy way to limit the amount of memory a program can use in a multi-platform way (I'm working on Windows at home). There are a bunch of methods to do that on Linux, but I feel like they're a bit contrived and part of a greater ecosystem of limits that may not really be easy to use in the context of cargo-bisect-rustc.\n With this program, you can specify the maximum amount of memory a command can use before it gets killed (of course, if it doesn't go over that limit, then everything goes normally). If needed, you can follow children too and assert that the sum of all memory consumed by all of them doesn't go over the limit. You can also switch between RSS memory and virtual memory, if needed. So, for example:\n $ memlimit 16GiB -c cargo install ripgrep --force \n This will:\n  \nset a limit of 16GiB (gibibytes, 16 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 bytes)\n with -c, follow all children spawned by the initial program and sum up their memory usage\n monitor the command cargo install ripgrep --force\n  \nI know this isn't a really impressive or important tool, but I felt there wasn't an easy-to-use multiplatform tool to do this. It's very small and doesn't have a lot of features, so I'm super open to criticism and suggestions!\n    submitted by    /u/FennecAuNaturel  \n [link]   [comments]",

This release contains several new features and improves existing features. Diesel now provides a procedural macro attribute that infers the correct return type for your query. It's now possible to instrument connection implementations provided by diesel to perform logging and performance measurements. We added support for PostgreSQL's COPY FROM and COPY TO syntax which can be used to send and receive large amounts of data efficiently. Our dependencies wrapping the native database drivers support now all building the database driver as part of your cargo build. This enables us to distribute static precompiled versions of diesel-cli easily. Finally we worked with the Rust team to stabilize attributes to customize error messages emitted by the compiler. This is now used by diesel to improve the quality of certain otherwise hard to understand error messages. \n This release wouldn't be possible without the support of our contributors and sponsors. If you want to support diesels development, consider joining the reviewer team, submitting PR's, help writing documentation or sponsor the maintainers.\n I'm happy to answer any questions about this release or diesel in general.\n    submitted by    /u/weiznich  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone, a few days ago I watched a video called writing your own daemon in C which lead me to try to write one on my own in Rust. I am by no means a Rustacean, nor an expert. Just an average programmer curious about writing a service in Rust. \n I call the Daemon birth-hound. It is as the name suggests a daemon which notifies you if it's anyone's birthday (it can be used for notifying you about other important dates as well!). It keeps track of a CSV file which includes the birth date and the person's name. Naturally the daemon checks for all the dates and then notifies using libnotify crate. \n Here are my questions :\n  \nIs this too simple of an idea to be written as a daemon, as daemon's do consume cpu and ram resources\n \nIs there another approach to do this? I discovered that systemd uses .timer which is used for scheduling programs, so instead of writing a long running process which actually excutes instructions once in a day, you could write a .timer file and in it tell it to execute the rust file to do the checking at 11:59pm everyday\n \nDo you think it is a good idea to write it in a cli style app wherein the user can do a birth-hound start or birth-hound stop to start and stop the daemon to their wish\n \nI would access the CSV file using File IO obviously, but should I asc users to create their own CSV file and ask them to manually enter it's path into the src code or should I provide them with a CSV myself, if it's the latter, how should I go about it?\n \n That's all the questions I have for now. Feel free to ask me more questions if you have any.\n Any sort of advise or guidance would be of great help!!!

          "description": "The main issue with Rust is that it's not fast to iterate - when it compiles it runs, but your logic may be wrong, and then you may need to change your stuff and make it correct again. However, the performance is over the roof and it's memory safe - performance and memory-safety are two hard to combine features\n Clojure is in a completely different place: it's BLAZINGLY fast to iterate, but - and now, this is probably because I'm a total newb in Clojure - it's pretty weird to try to squeeze super performance out of it. It's performant alright, but it's no Rust/C++, and can probably never be, since it's garbage-collected and has some decently costed abstractions\n So I think where I want to be is to have good mastery of both languages: using Rust for anything that needs to have high-performance or for low level stuff, and Clojure as the day-to-day tool to jack-in and hack away\n Now, I don't have enough knowledge of language design to understand how viable it would be, but it'd be pretty neat to have Clojure doing interop with Rust - you jack-in into a Rust program, invoke and break Rust functions in the REPL, iterate adding stuff; when you're done you compile the experiments into Rust code and make it Rust-compilable.

          "description": "Hollo, Rustacians! \n I'm a backend developer, and I mainly use Go. I had read the Rust Book multiple times before, as I find it be insightful and interesting. Last week I had some free time, so I decided to work on my first actual project in Rust. It was a simple HTTP server. \n Overall, it was a fun experience. The type system is powerful. I felt at home with defining types and attaching methods to them. Enums are great as well. The Option type for gracefully handling null values and the Result type for more flexible error handling. It was satisfying to refactor my code to remove cloning or to use ? for early returns.\n Although, I found the compiler to be too much in the way. At some points, my speed grinded to a halt, trying to understand what I did wrong and how should I fix it. Granted, I'm new, and it's only natural to face such problems. But in many cases, I had to alter the solution I had in my mind to match what the compiler expected of me, which required so much mental energy. It was challenging in a fun way, but my productivity plummeted.\n Now that I'm fairly done with the project, it feels like I'm missing something about Rust. Surely, I'll continue to use it for my side projects, but I don't get the hype around it. What makes it so great? Is it just the challenge of writing more idiomatic code and constant refactoring, or is there something that Rust does that I'm not appreciating?\n    submitted by    /u/hossein1376  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think the one key point, which was touched on in a lot of comments, but IMO never sufficiently isolated, is this: Rust is bad at imperfection.\n Code quality (rigor, correctness, efficiency, speed, etc) always comes at the cost of time/effort. The better you want your code to be, the more time/effort you need to invest. And the closer to perfection you get, the more it takes to push even further. That much should be pretty agreeable, regardless of the language. One might argue that Rust has a much better \"quality-per-time/effort\" curve than other languages (whether this is actually true is beside the …",

          "description": "I recently released my first ever proc-macro called pack_bools. It was a nice mix of frustration and joy as i had to navigate around syn, proc-macro2, quote and all the other tools. Some problems I encountered was that while syn was awesome for parsing the TokenStream, there was really no easy way to instantiate the AST structures from it, and I was kind of lost in how I was supposed to quote structures I had destructured. Also, it was quite hard to debug, I often got error messages like unexpected ,, but even with cargo expand it was sometimes invisible. But, I managed at last, and I am proud of the final product. Feedback highly appreciated!\n As a quick decription, the macro turns structs looking like this: ```rs use pack_bools::pack_bools;\n [pack_bools]\n [derive(Debug, Clone)]\n struct Config<'a> { output_name: &'a str, verbose: bool, pub use_colors: bool, original_file: &'a std::path::Path, legacy_mode: bool } ```\n into structs looking like this:\n ```rs\n [derive(Debug, Clone)]\n struct Config<'a> { output_name: &'a str, original_file: &'a std::path::Path, packed_bools: u8 }\n impl<'a> Config<'a> { /* getters and setters for the fields, with the same visibility as the fields */ } ```\n I also added lots of configuration options, inspired by serde, so you could do #[pack_bools(newtype)] to use the newtype pattern for the packed bool field, and much more. I looked around at crates.io a bit before making this, but didn't quite find anything just like this; I found some macros that generated bitfield-structs, and some macros that could expand a u8 field into multiple boolean fields with getters and setters, but I like the \"clean\" interface this crate provides.\n As said, feedback greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/CMDJojo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "https://github.com/fjall-rs/fjall\n Fjall is an embeddable LSM-based forbid-unsafe Rust key-value storage engine. Its goal is to be a reliable & predictable but performant general purpose KV storage engine, for both smaller, but especially larger-than-RAM data sets. I have just released version 1, which stabilizes its data format for all future 1.x.x versions.\n Its design is heavily influenced by LevelDB/RocksDB’s architecture and generally yields similar performance. It has similar features, like:\n  \nRange and prefix searches with forwards and backwards iteration\n Data partitions (”Column Families” in RocksDB-speak)\n Cross-partition atomic write batches\n MVCC & Snapshot reading\n Adjustable durability guarantees\n Size-tiered (write-optimized), Levelled (read-optimized) and FIFO compaction (for ephemeral data)\n  \nCompared to other Rust storage engines (e.g. Persy, ReDB, …), Fjall has better write and space amplification across the board while still having competitive read performance. It also has very low startup times (~0.1s for 1 billion keys) and very short compile times (~3s on my machine, compared to ~90s for RocksDB).\n AMA here, on GitHub (star the repo ❤️, https://github.com/fjall-rs/fjall/discussions) or on Discord (https://discord.com/invite/HvYGp4NFFk)\n You can find and run Fjall and other Rust storage engines in my Rust storage engine benchmark: https://github.com/marvin-j97/rust-storage-bench\n I have also made a bunch (more coming soon) of examples demonstrating some practical usage: https://github.com/fjall-rs/fjall/tree/main/examples\n https://preview.redd.it/2gbybwtix01d1.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=52c10545f596abe75a5975a6f9952bffb34455dc\n    submitted by    /u/DruckerReparateur  \n [link]   [comments]",

It may not be the most idiomatic or modern thing to do however if it helps someone who has navigated such code bases for 40 years read my code better for his review that’s a tradeoff I’m willing to make. In exchange he’s willing to put up with a completely new language to him. I’m grateful for being given the chance instead of being dismissed entirely. He comes from a pure automotive background written in C for critical systems. That’s a wide jump compared to Rust. If I can learn what he learned over these years and how he applies it to Rust this is probably way more invaluable than any philosophical battleground.\n PS: Hungarian notation for function parameters isn’t nearly as bad as you make it out to be.

Right now I'm reading the Rust Book and having a lot of fun, but I know to truly step up my game I need to do a personal project.\n Thing is, I don't know what to do. I came across a random comment from a different subreddit talking about their setup, and it seemed like they made their own music player (I'm not sure if this is the correct term, what I mean is programs like foobar2000, itunes, etc), and that caught my eye. I like music, and I've never had a music player that perfectly suits my needs, so I think it'll be a pretty fun challenge to make one myself, but I'm not sure if it's going to be too hard for me.\n I pretty much have absolutely no coding experience. Yes, I've said I used C/C++ before, and because of my line of work requires some knowledge of Python I learned that as well, but I only know them at a surface level. So going back to the question - Will making a music player be too hard for me? Should I do something simpler first?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/MangiBoi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've even started a LinkedIn page linkedin page where I share daily Rust tips and tricks that I discover along the way.\n But here's the thing: I know I've only scratched the surface. The Rust community is full of brilliant minds, and I'm convinced that there are countless \"Aha!\" moments and hidden gems out there that I haven't even encountered yet.\n So, I'm reaching out to all you fellow Rustaceans – what are some of the most mind-blowing, game-changing, or just plain cool Rust tips, tricks, or patterns that you've come across?\n Maybe it's a clever way to use generics, a surprising application of lifetimes, or a subtle optimization that made your code run like lightning. Whatever it is, I'm eager to learn from your experiences and expand my Rust knowledge.\n Let's share our collective wisdom and help each other become better Rust developers!\n    submitted by    /u/Level_Sprinkles_8861  \n [link]   [comments]",

Those issues were found using valgrind - a memory debuting tool, which I now use to verify the Rust code compiled for .NET behaves correctly (the runtime can run under valgrind, if the right flags are set).\n I have also finished a round of extensive fuzzing (46 434 773 LOC of MIR test programs), which allowed me to find and patch many other issues (mostly related to floating-point numbers).\n Some issues still remain (13 out of 10 000 generated tests still fail, and the fuzzing tool I use does not check for every kind of bug), but a lot more Rust code should now compile properly.\n There is still a lot of work to do, but I wanted to share some of the progress.\n Also, the project has reached 1024(2^10) stars on GitHub!

I find this way easier to read when parallelized; just painless to pattern match, scan over, and read across dimensions. The patterns are automatically provided to you, they're just there.\n What I want is this:\n [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 10] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 1] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 2] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 3] [src\\comb.rs:1260:3] count = [7, 0] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [7, 4] // .. \n versus\n [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 10, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 1, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 2, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 3, ] [src\\comb.rs:1260:3] count = [ 7, 0, ] [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count = [ 7, 4, ] // .. \n This is actual dbg! output from my program, which also demonstrates how pretty printing can even be unnecessarily confusing. The lines [src\\comb.rs:1290:4] self.count and [src\\comb.rs:1260:3] count are very similar, but in the single-line example it's much easier to spot the odd one out.\n I can copy-paste the source code into my own macro, but for a debug tool that I'd wanna use everywhere and anywhere it's just not the same. Is there an environment variable or some way to disable pretty printing everywhere?

          "description": "I recently started learning Rust and wanted to share my experience to encourage others who might be hesitant about its perceived difficulty. The notion that Rust is a tough language puts people from even trying, including my past self. This is particularly relevant for those who, like me, have primarily worked with GC'd languages (I've only ever completed one semester course in C++ and never used it professionally).\n For me, the learning curve for Rust wasn't as steep as it was for other programming paradigms I've used extensively, such as logic or pure functional programming. It only took me an evening or two to get somewhat comfortable with Rust, and within a week I was able to finish the book and complete a couple of projects. What made the transition smoother was the excellent \"onboard…",

Both attempts to receive UDP packets from an external device.\n Here's code (cannot be simpler)\n ``` using System; using System.Net; using System.Net.Sockets; using System.Text;\n class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { int listenPort = 4005; string broadcaster = \"192.168.0.88\";\n  using (UdpClient listener = new UdpClient(listenPort)) { IPEndPoint groupEP = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(broadcaster), listenPort); try { Console.WriteLine($\"Listening for UDP broadcasts from {broadcaster} on port {listenPort}\"); while (true) { byte[] bytes = listener.Receive(ref groupEP); string receivedData = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytes, 0, bytes.Length); Console.WriteLine($\"Received broadcast from {groupEP} : {receivedData}\"); } } catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine(e.ToString()); } } } \n } ```\n When I debug in dotnet6 it all works as intended. In .NET framework it simply waits for messages and nothing happens. It's the same if I run it in 'release', even from executable. I was running the code on Windows 10 x64 machine.\n But actually the code is intended to run on Windows7 Embedded (x86) device. What's irritating, any of the codes (not dotnet6 nor .net framework) works on that...\n Do you happen to have any ideas what may be the reason of such weird behavior?

I'm not sure how to tackle the problem of authenticating my users to both clients. A user can login using same account on both apps.\n I have some requirements that have to be met and some problems:\n  \nI don't to use an external identity provider like Auth0 or Firebase. I want to store user credentials in my own database. I have no problem with writing some password-hashing code myself.\n Native login: I don't want to open a browser window in my mobile app or redirect to another page in SPA, so I don't use OAuth\n Use cookies for the web app and Header-Authorization for the mobile app? It is considered insecure using localStorage for authentication tokens in SPAs\n Session management: I tend to use Server-Side-Sessions that are stored in the database. Users in the mobile app stay logged in infinitely, users in the web app should be logged out after 30 days of inactivity.\n How to pass the session ID to the mobile app if we can't use cookies the same way as in the Web app? Should we transmit it in the body JSON? Should the API check for a authentication token in both locations (Cookie and Header)\n Session rotation: When someone signs in, the server-side session token is generated and stored in the database, until it expires or the user logs out. Do I need some kind of rotation for this token?\n  \nWhat would you recommend? Do you have any examples for this use case or any libraries that I might use?\n Thanks a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/Loris156  \n [link]   [comments]",

I like the idea of not overloading classes/modules/methods with too much responsibility. If something has too many jobs it does become more challenging to maintain. Where I have issue with this principle is that it gives no guidelines about where to draw the line between what is a resposibility and what isn't. This is kind of a silly example but I could have a class called \"ServiceLayer\" and then say \"This class has one responsibility which is to manage the apps buisness logic\" and at the same time have a series of obsessi…",

Depending on how many accesses the user has, some of them will not be mapped, or all of them. Etc. Also all these actions are logged into a txt file found in the native folder of the app.\n So I've been testing the app and including all the logging, the app took 13s to persistently map 16 shares. \n I've also tried relying on native Windows APIs instead to make it faster but that just made it slower lol\n A few notes:\n I do NOT want async mapping as that would break the real-time progress text ((share name) mapped succesfully!). \n Async logging also seems to break the app. \n There's a function to pre-connect to the file server so if you use domain name instead of IP, the app won't be slowed down which would normally occur in the event of using domain name instead of IP\n I'm running out of ideas.\n Mind you, I have my IDE on a VM not on my host PC for a couple of reasons. 1) snapshots are super helpful and ofc I always back up working code into an encrypted location on my NAS; 2) I don't want to clutter my physical PC with dev stuff tbh.

This is my 1st job and throughout my tenure so far, my team and I are using a low-code software that allows us to finish web-based projects for production in less than a month.\n Last month I was told I will be moved to a new branch of IT. Because of this, I was told to study ASP.NET MVC. I will be mentored by a foreign senior IT. However, the mentoring was not as sophisticated as I imagined. They gave me no online courses, there are no curriculums, and they told me to just Google any technical-related stuff. I asked where will I learn jQuery and my mentor just gave me the link to the jQuery website. So, my learning was not structured. I hop from one article to another to learn ASP.NET MVC and watch different teachers in YouTube, and via reading the system code written in ASP MVC. It was not a fun experience, but in the end I achieved their expectations. Because of this, they made me the leader. \n Now for my scenario, since I know ASP.NET, they now tasked me to create a curriculum for new IT's that will be working/learning from me. I imagined my IT Head/Manager is better suited for this task because he likely knows a lot of programming in general or what the business needs, but he pushed this task on me for reasons I don't know. Since my learning was unmodulated and unstructured, and I know for a fact that the way they made me learn C# ASP.NET MVC was not for everyone, I'm utterly clueless on what online course will be effective in gearing new IT's for application development in C# be it ASP.NET or desktop application. The company is paying whatever it may be so there's that. All I know is this... whatever course it may be, it must have a certificate at the end, so the new IT's can put it in their personal website or resume for their future jobs, unlike me.\n I'm utterly clueless. Can anyone suggest? Thank you...\n    submitted by    /u/JoeNaks  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I have some lines like this in my code. This is part of a process which creates rows in a DB based on an input Excel file and other info from the DB. My boss wants the calculation of these final fields to be very flexible so formulas for some of them are stored on the DB as C# scripts.\n //Set up the formula execution string formula = config.Formula; var options = ScriptOptions.Default.AddReferences(typeof(ConsolidatedTBRow).Assembly); var globals = new ScriptGlobals { row = tbRow }; //Execute the formula value = CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync<object?>(formula, options, globals: globals).Result.ToString(); \n The problem is that when using a real input file, this code runs 4 times for each of the 38k rows in the input file. And, apparently, each time you run Evaluate on a CSharpScript it creates a process that then is not disposed of. This is causing memory to balloon a crazy amount until I get an out of memory error.\n I've seen a lot of other people mention this issue online but can't find any solutions. I found one fairly complicated one here but this doesn't seem to allow passing parameters to the script (my row variable) which I need to be able to do.\n EDIT: I ended up using DynamicExpresso instead of Roslyn. Not only did it solve my issue, it's also easier to use and my program runs insanely faster. Like, it used to take over an hour to run, and it just finished in about 10 minutes. I can't believe this library didn't come up when I was searching for how to run dynamic scripts in C#\n    submitted by    /u/ShadowShine57  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are both the same but SmallPart has weight and BigPart has serial number. Despite having a field not in common, I’m able to collect both of those instances.

Basic logic works like this: each savable item returns its own specific type of SaveState object, which is then serialized into Json. So Foo returns FooSaveState and Bar returns BarSaveState.\n It all worked pretty nicely until I reached the point where I need to save a state machine that is set up like this: there's an abstract Behavior class from which each specific state derives. The program has a List<Behavior> myBehaviors and during each update loop it calls myBehaviors[activeBehavior].Execute(). Each derived Behavior has its own set of internal data that I can't generalize out in a global BehaviorSaveState class because otherwise it would be a huge mess and a bit of a waste of space.\n Since I figured I'd save only the active state, I thought I'd solve the issue by writing in Behavior an abstract Save() method that returns a generic System.Object, then each derived behaviors overrides it with its own, specific SaveState class.\n Saving works well and the data written in the file is correct, but loading breaks, because I discovered that the deserialization, rather than a System.Object object, gives me a JsonElement object which I can't seem to be able to deserialize further, nor cast into the correct SaveState class.\n Help, please?

          "description": "We moved to .NET 7 a while back, took forever because of management and late support in Azure Service fabric. Anyway.. This opened up for required keyword which makes EF Core play nicer with nullable reference types.\n My suggested way foward is this. For all columns that are non null in sql map that to a none nullable reference type in the Entity and use required keyword so that object inilizers can be used. When inserting new entities this means either supply the child entity or if you only have the Id fool the compiler by using null!\n db.AddAsync(new Entity { NavPropId = 1, NavProp = null! }); \n Personaly I think this is pretty ok, and on the query side we always Project. For collections we do\n public required ICollection<T> NavProps { get; set; } = new List<T>(); \n This way we can avoid nullable type which requires you work around it in queries and projections using ! like\n .Select(x => x.MyNoneNullableCollection!.Select(y => ...)); \n Only real downside is that it allocates. But since we project its minimal allocation.\n What do you guys think, is it a good practice, any feedback or ideas are gladly taken. Thanks\n Update: There is nothing gained by doing { get; set; } = new List<T>().

Make the Model an observable object with observable properties and update Viewmodel properties from the model. Or make some sort of \"GameManager\" state class that can manage the game object and communicate to the Viewmodels. How would you handle this? Specifically I'm worried if I have a single Game instance and multiple Viewmodels that can interact with it I will have thread safety issues. My code started getting pretty complex for something that I'm guessing should be simple. What am I missing?\n    submitted by    /u/andersonee  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a C# beginner but trying to learn how to apply my current knowledge into web development (any advice or pointers would be appreciated :) ). The one issue that I'm struggling with is understanding the difference between Blazor and ASP.NET and when should I choose one over the other. It seems like ASP.NET is the older and battle tested framework while Blazor is the new(er) kid on the block. Blazor seems (I might be wrong) easier to learn and has more eye candy/UX type stuff in it.\n I'm cautious about picking it up because it seems like the big thing that I got out of reading this sub is that Microsoft has a habit of releasing a new technology/framework and then abandoning it if it doesn't get enough traction. Is that something that I should be concerned about with using a newer technology like Blazor? Or has Blazor received enough traction that the chances of that happening are low? Or does it not even matter because the skill sets and code are transferable between the two?\n    submitted by    /u/Heli0sX  \n [link]   [comments]",

What else besides App Insights is useful for collecting data on an Azure app? I have seen perfview and dotnet-trace but have no experience with them\n We have a backend ASP.NET Core Web API in Azure that has about 500 instances of Task.Run, usually wrapped over synchronous methods, but sometimes wraps async methods just for kicks, I guess. This is, of course, bad (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/best-practices?view=aspnetcore-8.0#avoid-blocking-calls)\n We've been having performance problems even when adding a small number of new users that use the site normally, so we scaled out and scaled up our 1vCPU / 7gb memory on Prod.

I asked GPT about this and it pointed to the second results being true as well. \n If I understood correctly, s1 creates a new string object on the heap (which is automatically registered in the intern pool) and holds the reference to that string object. i1 checks the VALUE of s1 to see if it exists in the intern pool, and since it does, i1 takes the reference from the intern pool, making s1 and i1 reference the same string object.\n Similarly, s2 creates another string object with the same value as s1 on the heap (although I'm not sure if it is immediately added to the intern pool). i2 checks the VALUE of s2 in the intern pool, finds that this string object has already been created, and thus takes the reference from the intern pool. As a result, i1 and i2 reference the same object, so they return true.\n I'd be glad if someone could explain how the intern works and why the results differ?\n PS: I'm running it in .net 7 in local and 8 in online compilers.\n    submitted by    /u/PhantomGolem  \n [link]   [comments]",

I attempted using a TCP socket where the client sends Isaac Sim outputs to a server running on the local IP (e.g., '127.0.0.1:8080'). I have verified the connection through a web browser by running Flask on \"127.0.0.1:5000/video\". On the web browser, it works fine by displaying when sending a video file, but after changing the source of the frame, namely editing #VideoCapture(0) to a webcam it doesn't work. \n However, in my C# project, when I set the IP to 127.0.0.1 and the port to 8080, there's a second port number. (is it optional or not?). I don't actually have a physical Raspberry Pi camera module; there is just an option in the C# project to select a Raspberry Pi camera. Is sending frames from Isaac Sim to this option in the C# project equivalent to sending frames from a Raspberry Pi camera module to the C# project? How can I achieve this through a TCP socket to display frames on a C# desktop application? \n Thank you for your assistance. \n    submitted by    /u/Signal_Egg2961  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you manage Active Directory and Azure AD synchronization in your environment, this might be useful for you!\n https://github.com/TheITApprentice/AD-Sync-Manager\n AD Sync Manager is designed to help streamline and simplify the AD to Azure AD sync process. It provides an easy way to monitor sync status, get alerted on issues, and manage sync cycles.\n With this tool, you can:\n  \nView the status of your AD Connect sync cycles\n Get notified if delta or initial sync fails\n Manually trigger full or delta syncs\n Analyze sync errors to identify objects with issues\n And more!\n  \nIt's built with PowerShell so it should be easy to deploy in most AD/Azure environments. I'm actively developing it and welcome any feedback or suggestions.\n If you struggle with keeping your on-prem and cloud directories in sync, give AD Sync Manager a try. Let me know if you have any questions - I'm happy to help!\n Hopefully this tool saves you some time and headaches.

          "description": "Seems that the problem with checked exceptions is not about how verbose they are or how bad they scale (propagate) in the project, nor how ugly they make the code look or make it hard to write code. It is that you simply can't enforce someone to handle an error 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐲, despite enforcing dealing with the error at compile time.\n Although the intention is good, as Brian Goetz said once:\n  \nChecked exceptions were a reaction, in part, to the fact that it was too easy to ignore an error return code in C, so the language made it harder to ignore\n  \nyet, static checking can't enforce HOW those are handled. Which makes almost no difference between not handling or handling exceptions but in a bad way. Hence, it is inevitable to see people doing things like \"try {} catch { /* do nothing */ }\". Even if they handle exceptions, we can't expect everyone to handle them equally well. After all, someone just might deliberately want to not handle them at all, the language should not prevent that either.\n Although I like the idea, to me, checked exceptions bring more problems than benefits.\n    submitted by    /u/turik1997  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to share a situation I'm in and get your opinions on it.\n Recently, I had a technical interview that went quite well, and I've been offered a position. However, instead of using Spring Boot, the company uses Java Vert.x. I've been researching Vert.x and set up a demo project to get familiar with the technology. It seems interesting, especially depending on the complementary libraries they use, like ORM Hibernate Reactive, among others.\n My main concern is about switching from Spring, a highly demanded framework with great prospects, to Vert.x. I feel it's a step out of my \"comfort zone,\" not so much technically, but in terms of stability and the future of the technology. With the threat of Loom, Virtual Threads, and other developments, I'm worried whether the ecosystem of libraries around Vert.x is modern and follows industry standards, or if it's more oriented towards \"legacy\" solutions.\n I've been with my current company for about six months, and while I'm not completely happy with the team and tools, the conditions and environment are not ideal. The new offer has a significant salary increase and other social benefits that are very appealing, but Vert.x is the only point where I have doubts.\n Do you think it's worth leaving Spring Boot, even temporarily, and betting on reactive programming with Vert.x? Has anyone here made a similar switch and could share their experience? Should I consider this \"leap of faith\" or keep looking for opportunities that align more with my experience in Spring Boot?\n I appreciate any advice or experiences you can share.\n PD: I'm 24 years old, so I'm young. 2-3 years experience.\n    submitted by    /u/byHelper  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I heard a lot of people saying that Reactive Framework like Netty, RxJava is dying because of java 21 provides this feature out of the box using Virtual Thread. As I do some research about it so far, they added one more layer which is Virtual Thread and instead of blocking at the Platform Thread layer, which is consider to be expensive in order to create or perform context switching, now we block at the Virtual Thread layer which is way more cheaper and consume less memory using continuation and yield similar to couroutine in Kotlin. I agree that this approach would provide better performance. However, it doesn't provide some kind of non-blocking or asynchronous feature out of the box at all it still keep blocking but just at the difference layer.\n PS, my intention was just asking for knowledge I might miss understand something.

          "description": "Hey guys, after learning java for about 8-9 months, I've tried to apply for some jobs, but I've got a fast reality check. I could see that I don't know a lot of theory and I believe that my problem is that I only know \"practical\" java. So I've wanted to ask you guys, is the book \"thinking in java\" still relevant? The last release was in 2017, so maybe there is a better book to learn the theory that you can recommend for me. Also if you would have some other tips (what should projects contain, what tools should I learn etc.) for someone like me who is trying to find his first tech job, I would be grateful.\n Thanks for every response, and I hope everyone reading this has a wonderful day!\n    submitted by    /u/DependentAlarmed6587  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been in software for just over 13 years, and I've noticed a dramatic change in how much I code. Here’s how much time I spent coding throughout my career and the general timeline of my software engineer life:\n  \n Time Frame in Career Title Time Coding \n  \n 0 to 1 year Graduate Soft Eng 75% \n  1 to 3 years Junior Soft Eng 75% \n  3 to 5 years Soft Eng 60% \n  5 to 8 years Senior Soft Eng 50% \n  8 to 13 years Lead Soft Eng 40% \n  13 to present Principal Soft Eng <5% \n \n For the most part I've been doing a lot of backend Python/AWS blah blah stuff. But with my new job I'm running several teams for 3 product lines that include front and back end. However the main issue is, as above, I do less than 5% coding per day. The rest is just solid meetings, fleshing out Jira tickets or architecture design stuff.\n I know it's a pointless metric to worry about but I can't help but get a slight bit of anxiety that I'm deskilling and losing the tricks of my trade that got me to where I am. Is this common for a jump like this? My initial Googling all points to wildly different answers, which I suspect will be voiced the same here. But some people, as Principal, say they code for upwards of 50% of the time per day.\n Am I paranoid about getting worried or is this the point of my career that I become Bill Lumbergh from Office Space and actually I'm now a \"manager\"?\n    submitted by    /u/TheRustyPilgrim  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm unsure of how to pick this up with management and what this could mean for my career. I really like the company and the culture but this crosses a line for me.\n I'm clueless on how to handle this, I don't want to cause harm to the company by leaving, because that would cause some major, business continuity disrupting damage.\n    submitted by    /u/TheAnarchoX  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Not everyone loves what they do for a career and that's OK. There's nothing that says you need to love what you do in order to be a good engineer. Choosing a career because you want to make money is a perfectly fine reason to pursue something.\n Most skilled engineers aren't working personal projects day in and day out because they love coding. Turns out you can make tons of money and be super successful while not caring much for the field in general.\n \"The best software engineers are the ones that are passionate\". Hard disagree. The best engineers are the ones that invest the most time into improving. Whether or not you 'love coding' is irrelevant. You can invest just as much time into something because you know you will make a lot of money in the end.\n Edit: Some people are misunderstanding what I am saying. Not being passionate does not mean hating what you do. I am talking about people who make CS their identity, and then look down/talk down to anyone who brings up the fact that they are doing it because it is a well paying career. I see this a lot more online and amongst students/young professionals. \n    submitted by    /u/nysoxfan01  \n [link]   [comments]",

Fast forward to now: needed money somehow so now I repair engines. I don’t remember the last time I even coded something. \n This used to be my passion since middle school and an integral part of who I was. Weird to see me not even think about it anymore. \n I wouldn’t say I’ve totally given up… but I almost wish I didn’t get my masters so I could have gotten a real SWE job a few years ago with ease and have actual work experience so getting a job right now wouldn’t be impossible.\n Thoughts?\n (This message obviously contains some elements of slight exaggeration)\n EDIT: I don’t need “dont give up just keep trying” comments. I am aware of that. I will do so, but not at this time. I am not going to feel guilt about taking a few months off from the process of sending out hundreds of applications per month with a 99.9% rejection rate, or at least not right now I’m not. I’m burned out from doing this for a year straight. If you suggest that I will fail in my career in CS because of this then you are seriously misunderstanding the sentiment of this post. I’m not giving up on my career.\n EDIT2: thank you all for your wide variety of responses and the thoughtfulness you have put into them. I won’t retype all my replies here but I have concluded that I need to try other things than brute force spamming job applications for only SWE/web dev jobs and try to get anything to get my foot in the door + critique and revise my resume according to professional advice.

I had picked up a job back in march at a small insurance agency to develop a CRM lead management system for the company. The reason I picked up the job was to gain experience. I am the sole developer at my job and I am not going to lie I am gaining a lot of hands on experience primarily with Node.js, React, Azure, Git, REST APIs and a bunch of other things I cant remember to list. I report directly to the agency owner who is non technical, he likes my work and constantly tells me how smart I am but I feel as though he doesn't know what he is doing sometimes. He expects a single college student to build a CRM for his agency with no guidance from a senior engineer. I believe I am doing good work at this job and he thinks im pretty good too but I feel as though he is rushing me constantly asking me for updates on the project and setting deadlines for his employees to start using the CRM by this month. I have never had anyone use software written by me before so I am unsure of how this will pan out and I don't want to be responsible for such a big project in his business. Also I feel like for the amount of responsibility I have I shouldn't be getting paid 15 an hour and due to the fact that I am graduating soon I don't see myself staying here any much longer as 15 an hour wont cut it. When he initially hired me he promised that I can move up in the company and become a manager and that there would be a pay increase.

Take care of your health - once you get older, medical costs become a significant cost no matter your insurance, and worse if you don't take care of yourself. \n Oh, you wanted career advice?

I was initially hired as \"programmer\" and assumed I'd work in a team (which I mentioned during the interview), someone more senior, or at least someone else since they had 2 openings for the position.\n I couldn't be more wrong. Let's just say the team is basically non-existent and I was the only programmer in the company.\n While I could just give half assed work that barely works, I held myself to a higher standard and even go beyond sometimes. I set up a git repository with proper branches, proper documentation, make sure everything readable, proper security (last guy didn't even encrypt the passwords), did extra research and analysis whenever possible (I double majored in Statistics), etc. Within my first 90 days I've done everything from web apps to Android and native desktop apps from ground up.\n Both my supervisor and director were always pleased with my work and often praised me, though that means nothing if I had no one else to compare my work and performance to. They've been asking if I was interested in becoming a full time employee or at least a freelance since I was already familiar with the system. I'm thinking of taking the job and continue for a year to see if there's hope before finding a job elsewhere, so I'm planning to renegotiate the \"programmer\" title.\n TLDR: I think I've been responsible for more than what \"programmer\" would reflect in my resume. Would it be okay for me to ask for Full Stack Dev or Junior Dev title? Software Engineer?

It is quite error prone, and hallucinates often, and it looks like we may have reached a local maxima in terms of AI models (that is enthusiasm seems to have died down a bit).\n Cloud computing, though interesting in its own right, abstracts so many problems, and automates more work than AI. It only takes a few lines of code to create a dynamodb that can scale incredibly well with low latency. Same can be said about serverless, apis, and other services.\n It is incredible to me how abstracted the services are to the point that basic distributed system problems no longer require in depth knowledge (though you should probably still learn it). Same can be said with machine learning itself on an enterprise level. It is much easier to use Amazon Bedrock to create an LLM rather than learn the linear algebra behind the algorithms. The amount of code required is now reduced to just a few lines.\n For all of the attention that AI gets, cloud over abstracts and replaces a lot more work.\n EDIT: Seems like it is pretty clear now that this is a case of lower barrier to entry yields more productivity, thus more employees (thank you u/otherbranch-official) .

The cream of the crop are of course getting jobs at or above their previous TC, but \"middle of the pack\" staff aren't getting traction\n Non-FAANG are having a much harder time flipping from the \"other\" tech jobs into the \"FAANG & former FAANG\" pool since so many people already in those jobs are circulating & looking for them. \n FAANG and former FAANG may be taking paycuts and working the \"other\" jobs for a while, but I am pretty sure they would still be actively job hunting and working their networks to get a FAANG class job to get back their previous lifestyles.\n The overall effect is everyone is having trouble finding jobs that pay at or more than they were making before.\n So there is some impact on the non-FAANG markets as well. But predominantly what we have been seeing is FAANG-class job markets becoming extremely competitive, even when compared to how competitive they have always been, whereas the non-FAANG class jobs are somewhat more competitive but not nearly as much.\n If anyone has any research or thoughts on this I would love to see / hear it.\n    submitted by    /u/NormalUserThirty  \n [link]   [comments]",

They didn't threaten my position directly, but it all felt very threatening and dehumanising since the one that roasted me is my direct higher-up and since they literally only log in two days per week to ask me for progress as the rest of their tasks they dumped on me.\n I'm beyond furious and mentally checked out of this company and I'm thinking whether to quit this week. I have savings that would last me years if I maintained my current lifestyle. Ideally, I'd take a month or two off and then start applying to new jobs.\n Would quitting now be that huge of a mistake? I know it would likely hurt me when negotiating salaries, but would it massively influence my recruitment potential, not having a job?\n    submitted by    /u/Smallest_Bubbles  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A few weeks ago, I posted about being laid off while pregnant and not getting any callbacks. I got some great feedback on my resume, and I want to thank everyone who helped.\n Here's my update: - I updated my resume based on the suggestions from the post. Some advice was contradictory, so I chose what I thought was best. - I kept applying to only remote jobs. Even though some suggested trying onsite roles, I don't think I can go back to the in-office life. - I mostly got rejections, even with the updated resume, even when I met 100% of the requirements. I stopped counting the number of applicants. I carefully read each job description and only applied when I felt qualified, taking time to answer form questions and write cover letters. I started getting discouraged and applying less and less.\n  \nI realized I was too emotionally invested in this process, so I hired a VA on Upwork. I gave him a guide on what jobs to submit for (remote in NA, mentioning Python with 5+ years of experience), two versions of my resume, and a Google form to fill out after each application. This seems to be working better. He has applied for 500+ jobs so far, and I got 10 recruiter calls and 8 tech interviews set up. Six are US-based companies looking to hire Canadians, and two are early-stage Canadian startups. For four of the eight, I don’t even match the job requirements (different tech stack), but they still wanted to interview me 🤷‍♀️.\n  \nI have my first technical interview tomorrow—a live coding session (not LeetCode/Python).\n Any ideas on how to prepare?

If you need to do a quick 30 minute errand/whatever causes to be away from your desk for an extended period of time do you \"clock-out\"/work the extra 30 mins, or however long you were out, take vacation, or not do anything? \n Or do yall work like 4 hours a day and claim you're working 8 hours and just do whatever else whenever you can? \n    submitted by    /u/ThrowRA-IAmABadFrend  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm afraid that if I'm not able to finish tickets within a day, I'm going to lose my job. I'm afraid that if I don't actively contribute at every meeting, I'm going to lose my job. It feels like, for every reason I can find for me being able to keep my job, I find 3-4 other reasons why I'm more likely to lose it.\n Ever since I'd gotten hired, it's felt like I've been walking on a thin string that can snap at any moment, at which point I'd fall to my death.

          "description": "Alright, well, guess we're back at it again bois. No-job life baby 😎\n Okay, all jokes aside, I'm actually still flabbergasted from all of this. Long story short, I was working at a startup until last Friday, when my boss and I suddenly had a one-on-one call over Zoom. The conversation was basically about me having to be more \"responsible\" in my job. In other words, reply to messages on the weekends, work overtime (with no pay), etc. In a nutshell, I apologized, politely said no, and that I was going to work strictly within the hours I'm meant to: 9 to 5. I was pretty much fired on the spot shortly after that.\n You see, ever since I'd gotten hired, I'd made my boundaries very clear and never failed to set them up. Once 5pm hits, I'm out. Nobody can contact me for work-related reasons. I don't care if something is broken or whatever, I'm not fixing it until the next day or the following Monday (if it's a Friday). Unless you communicate to me that you're going to pay me overtime, I'm out. I have things to do in my private life, like taking care of family and simply hunkering down so that I have the energy to get back at it the next day.\n I think that boundaries are very important, especially if they ultimately help you to love your job more and to be able to have good mental health. To expect and to demand from employees, especially to their face, that they're meant to sacrifice their life for the company they're working for is a huge red flag in my book. It really sucks to not have a job anymore, as the market is complete doodoo, but it is what it is.\n    submitted by    /u/U51dJegT6RPyyziJxqvG  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There've been a tonne of posts here outlining the detrimental effects of outsourcing US based jobs outside of the US. I tried looking for examples online of legislation passed to penalize companies for outsourcing, but they are scant. \n  \nSenator Baldwin of Wisconsin Introducing the End Outsourcing Act - [Link]\n Although the act leaned more towards Manufacturing Jobs and Federal Spending to US Private Contractors that would turn around and outsource the costs of the service, there hasn't been much progress since 2021/2022 \n \nNo Tax Breaks for Outsourcing Act (2023) - [Link]\n Which mostly aimed at killing tax incentives for multinationals that shipped overseas. The approach here seems to rollback Trump-era tax breaks for corporations, and increase taxes on foreign profits therefore increasing local profits and disincentivizing outsourcing.\n \n ​\n All in all, the outsourcing problem seems complex and intertwined with very touchy facets of US commerce and labor, coupled with corporate desire for Short-Term profits. We cannot forget how the outsourcing plague in the mid-80s killed many American automotive manufacturing jobs and partly led to the demise of prosperous US Cities e.g. Detroit\n Do you think with the recent layoffs both in Tech and other fields that there is a likelihood that such legislation will be brought back up?

          "description": "I've been a web developer for the last 5-6 years(mainly frontend, but I worked with Node.js and express for a while). I work for a Big Tech company and I earn a reasonable salary. \n My problem is I'm exhausted and I feel I can't keep it anymore: We have a lot of strict deadlines and everyone works an unreasonable amount of hours.\n Last Friday, I had to work until 4AM to finish an urgent task that just appeared. This week, I worked 10-12 hours days to finish a bunch of important tasks. I'm not the only one - almost all of my team worked until midnight on tasks and codereviewsw.\n I don't know how to handle this because this is the way we worked for the last 3 years. My manager has very good intentions and he is a technical person, but I feel this is part of the problem.\n Our estimates goes like that: We need to build a popup with some tex and 2 buttons and call an API when \"confirm is clicked\".\n Me: It will take 3-4 days. Let's say 4 to be safe.\n Manager: 4 days for this ? It's simple enough, should be 2 days at most.\n Me: Yeah, but we want 100% coverage unit tests, use feature flags, the API is not ready yet and we use mock data, 2 people should review the code, we deploy on stage and prod, manual test everything (no QA). We even write e2e tests. \n In reality, even 4 days is not enough because some things are always unclear, and I have to clarify with 2-3 people and propose solutions. The codebase is very big and a lot of code has been untoched for years etc. So I end up working 12 hours/day to respect even the 4 days estimation, knowing my manager thinks is should be 2, which in fact should probably be 6-8 days because I'm not a robot.\n And I can't continue to work like that. I don't have time for myself, let alone personal development and learning new things.\n I don't know what to do. I talked with my manager a lot, and it's true we managed to complete the task in 4 days, but with me working 12+ hours and going above&beyound for this to happen. \n    submitted by    /u/InspectorDizzy3391  \n [link]   [comments]",

While you might think it's exclusively because of interest rates, a relatively unknown factor contributing to this crisis is Section 174 of the US tax code.\n What’s Section 174?\n Before 2022, Section 174 allowed companies to fully deduct research and development (R&D) expenses, including software engineer salaries, in the year they were incurred. This incentivized innovation and fueled the rapid growth of tech startups. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 changed the game, which went into effect in 2022.

All the senior roles are asking for 5-8 YOE anyway which seem to be the majority of positions, and the junior roles seem to be mostly looking for freshers. \n Got rejected from a few senior roles because I just didn't have the years. Understandable have a nice day. Got rejected from a junior role because the hiring manager said something along the lines of they were \"seeking candidates who are at an earlier stage in their career and can grow alongside our team\". I understand that you don't want to hire someone overqualified because they might leave soon but what the fuck. \n Is there some secret word I need to type into Indeed to find the jobs which take people with 2 years of experience?

Post graduation I didn’t have anything lined up, so during the summer I worked as a bag boy at a local golf course, then eventually went back to a broker I interned for to work as an office assistant part time all while I continued to job search. Sent out hundreds of applications and got interviews here and there, but no luck getting hired. It was honestly such a draining experience. I couldn’t even get hired for a position paying 45-50k a year and a lot of them were customer service based roles, very entry level. Fast forward to now, I got hired to be an ‘engineer’ but the role is more so a project management role. Absolutely no experience in the field and they are willing to train me. One thing I learned about obtaining a job is it’s all about who you know and if the timing is right. The guy whos position I am taking over got promoted and I happen to know someone within the company which definitely helped. One in-person interview and three weeks later they sent me an offer, which definitely caught me off guard.

          "description": "Whenever I had an experienced technical project lead, things have been incredible. \n Whenever I’ve had non-technical managers doing their Agile thing, I’ve HATED my life. \n Technical leads would jump straight into a problem and either unblock us or understand immediately why things are taking so long or why something can’t be done. They are focused on quality, they care about the software and where it is going. Non-technical managers want things done in X amount of time and you need to explain to them like they’re 5 why it hasn’t been done yet. \n How am I supposed to respect someone and essentially report to them when they know nothing about technology? \n These are roles to whip the employees to work harder, slaves overlooking other slaves. They’re there to force devs to give themselves deadlines and burn themselves out. \n Yes, there are also technical managers who aren’t good managers. Imo you need to be both good at management and good at technology, if you’re good at just one of these, you’re automatically not good enough. Your lack in the other area will show up. The definition of a leader, to me, is someone you look up to, who can do at least everything that you do and more. \n This industry is a bit of a joke, not surprised that people can’t take us seriously when we call ourselves “engineers”. It seems like everyone who knows how to send an email and takes one course can come in and start managing projects. No wonder this industry is flooded and sinking. \n    submitted by    /u/pinkbutterfly22  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been doing as much leetcode as I can as I before I finish off uni\n I asked around previous hires about the OA and what to prep, and they mentioned it was dom manipulation or what not but all I got was leetcode mediums and 1 hard. I managed to solve one and another one 14/15 test cases but last one did not have time to complete so it is half solved.\n Also I hate how RNG plays a part in these OA, I had a friend that told me his questions were like 1 LC medium and 2 LC easy, one was some simple string manipulation and another a simple hashmap solution both less than 20 lines while I got shafted rip, \n Pairing all this with the constant rejections from other companies, and the occasional reach final stage to only be rejected, it gets depressing every now and then.\n Just needed an outlet to rant, sorry to put more negativity into this thread. I will keep on grinding for sure and get better at my problem solving abilities and not give up of course and keep applying elsewhere, wishing everybody luck!!\n    submitted by    /u/Thepeebandit  \n [link]   [comments]",

After going through a particularly brutal experience (5 interviews + a take-home case study) and not hearing back, I decided to work on a tool that automatically tracks your applications, matches you with positions where you’re more likely to hear back and do well, and even predicts when you've been ghosted by a company (something I constantly experienced).\n https://preview.redd.it/tyo71u9a9u3d1.png?width=2846&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb24301ef065c714e28e3d97d2862d3ecf5f0a7c\n While the tool is still in development, it's helped a few people already, so I’m looking to get feedback from other CS students to make it even better. If you’re currently looking for internships (I'm currently working with a few startups looking for interns across business, design, and technology) and are interested in using the platform or providing feedback, please PM me and I’ll share the link. I really want to make finding internships easier for everyone, since I know how difficult and frustrating the application process can be, any feedback would be amazing.

The final interview went very well. The hiring manager (Very pleasant person) was very excited about me getting started ASAP because they were behind on a few projects and had a few more incoming. At the end of the interview, she assured me that they decided to hire me and to look out for the offer letter within a day or two. I was checking my email so often that I might have broken some record or two. The next day passed and no offer. The second day passed and no offer but now I am getting really nervous. On the third day, I get an email that they have decided to go with someone else.....\n I was crushed inside. This took all the wind out of me and now every time I fill out an application, my mood just drops when I remember this experience. \n About a week after that I called the recruiter (who was present in all interviews) and kindly asked for feedback and then asked her why they went with someone else after I was explicitly told that they chose me.\n Her answer..... \"The hiring manager wanted the other candidate because he had FiveTran experience....\"\n I could not believe it. Fivetran was never brought up in the interviews and it is insanely easy to learn. I thanked her for her time and help and asked her to send me other opportunities she came across.\n Well, that is how I lost out on a Fully Remote Job with a $94k base salary at Pratt&Whittney. \n :( Thank you for your time.

I am not the person who went into CS only for the money or because it was trendy. I appreciate and am fascinated by technology, but it feels like the people I'm competing with live and breathe code, making it difficult for me to keep up since I don't enjoy coding all day or studying CS in general outside of classes.

They have me fixing bugs: there's a bug tracking system and I have access to the proprietary bug list, then I try to fix the code. It's super interesting. Obviously we don't make this public or use some open source tracker because there's a lot at stake even if it's just a simple thing like going over the speed limit once in a while. One time the system was turning on the windshield wipers in clear weather and turning them off in rain. We thought that was hilarious. \n So, we have this restricted area where there's a test track. We have to test the vehicles in a controlled environment very very thoroughly. A little while ago the test engineers became very stressed and agitated. We tried to find out why because they were mostly really smart nerds who left us alone. I was processing the bug list and I found a system video from a video where the test car ran over a kitty cat. I asked around and that was why the test engineers were so upset. It obviously wasn't their fault: after I studied the logs I figured out how a particular function misidentified the cat and failed to avoid it. The function had several logic errors in the way shapes and movement were processed. Now I have to decide what to do about it. I can fix it quietly, like I usually do. I could tell my boss or make an entry in the bug tracker that the function was programmed wrong. That could get back to the AI Vision Manager and she could be really mad. Someone could be fired over it. I don't want to make people mad at me. The bug is fixed. I think I should forget about it so I can have a good relationship with my coworkers and no one gets fired.

          "description": "To clarify, I did do homework, but that's pretty much all the mental exercise I got in regards to subject matter, most of the time I just absorbed the concept as the teacher was teaching it, so it wasn't really all that hard to execute it when the time came\n So not sure if it still exists, but it was through a program at Rutgers where I took classes at NJIT, so I guess it's technically NJIT? But basically I was a lazy student and pretty much just chose Comp Sci since I thought it was one of the majors people took, when they didn't care, so I pretty much just graduated with a Comp Sci degree having never studied, and didn't learn until later that Comp Sci is actually considered one of the harder majors. GPA wasn't spectacular or anything, somewhere in the 3.0-3.5 range IIRC. I'm curious if this is the standard situation or if mine was unique\n    submitted by    /u/dreemsequence  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ensure that your narrative is clear and that all essential information is presented in a compelling way\".\n Does she mean that the content itself is weak or it could be presented in a better way (I have mailed her and awaiting her response)? In the meanwhile, what do you guys think?\n https://preview.redd.it/ou5kpm02wl1d1.png?width=1310&format=png&auto=webp&s=a52d8341a06b3bb600307aa3de29109ec0bd6d58\n    submitted by    /u/SuccMyStrangerThings  \n [link]   [comments]",

I feel like tech hiring isn’t really “bad”, of course it is compared to a few years ago, but for a job that (in the big places) pays way more than IB starting, cooler work, better culture and WLB, it’s only natural that it gets ultra competitive.\n It’s still possible to get tech jobs, it’s just really hard and you have to put in all the stops (just like I see my friends in IB doing), so target school, networking, interview prep, resume padding, the whole thing. \n I think the old times were a bit of a fever dream and now it’s just reality. Tech is still a great option but it (rightfully) is now really competitive just like IB is. I feel like the FAANG+ SWE life is a pretty great one, so it only makes sense that the process of getting it becomes more and more competitive \n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/Beginning_Act_1894  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey r/Emudev, per your advice I've started working on a chip8 emulator (in C++) for my first project, and its been been good fun. As far as modeling the CPU, memory, and other system components, I've had little trouble thanks to to some system programming classes I've taken in the past. However, I'm at a roadblock when it comes to rendering the video output. I've tried a few different approaches, first trying SDL and then moving on to just using OpenGL libraries and I feel a bit lost. Does anyone have any good resources for getting OpenGL or SDL working for someone with no background in graphics programming? I would even be open to other approaches but preferably staying in C++ and something that could also be used in later projects.\n PS: I am currently just developing in a Windows 10 environment\n    submitted by    /u/Maras59_  \n [link]   [comments]",

The following is a description of the events that unfold, together with debug information:\n  \nThe bootrom Nintendo logo is loaded and carried out. Then the game loads as usual. \n IE: 0b0000'0001 | IF: 0b000'0001\n JOYP [FF00]: 0b1111'1111\n \n I press the mapped \"Start\" button: \n IE: 0b0000'0001 | IF: 0b0001'0000\n JOYP [FF00]: 0b1101'0111\n \n I release the mapped \"Start\" button: \n IE: 0b0000'0001 | IF: 0b0001'0000\n JOYP [FF00]: 0b1111'1111\n \n  \nAnd nothing happens. IE never becomes 0b0001'0001 in order to enable the interrupt. One source I read claims that that most games do not use this interrupt for joypad inputs.\n Interestingly, if I keep pressing \"Start\", at some point, the game registers that it has been pressed, and the screen advances. I have done the same with the other buttons, where the game loads, and I will, for example, press \"Left Arrow\" and the character will move, after like 50 button presses.\n Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated!

I'm not sure what exactly the expected behavior is supposed to be.\n I've seen multiple sources say that, after enabling the LCD, the very first scanline on the first frame has different timings from other scanlines, but I can't find timing documentation for this anywhere.\n Here's what I've gathered so far:\n  \nThe PPU starts in mode 0 (HBlank) after the LCD is enabled. There is no mode 2 on the first scanline.\n After mode 0, PPU advances to mode 3, which is unusual.\n The PPU advances from mode 3 to mode 0, and remains in this mode until the end of the scanline.\n After scanline 0, the PPU resumes normal operation (mode 2, mode 3, mode 0, etc)\n The PPU starts 2 t-cycles \"late\"?\n The LCD is blank for the first frame after it is enabled\n  \nWhat is the timing for scanline 0? How long does the PPU stay in each mode?\n Are any interrupts requested during the first frame after enabling the LCD?\n How is the PPU started 2 cycles \"late\" if it starts in mode 0 and jumps straight to mode 3? How can it be late if it starts in HBlank?\n Is there any documentation out there that describes this behavior?\n I had a look at Higan, and it runs mode 0 for 72 clocks, then mode 3 for 172 clocks (according to Kevtris this might need to be 173.5), then back to mode 0 until 456 clocks have elapsed.

Should the emulator just ignore it and increment (by 2) the PC?\n The PC is greater than 4096 (CP overflow).

          "description": "I have an idea that I have never seen implemented or discussed anywhere and I wonder if it would be possible to do it. I'm not talking about motion interpolation for 2D video which you hear a lot about these days. I'm thinking about calculating extra frames by interpolating the 3D coordinates of triangle vertices to boost the framerate of any 3D game without modding it. Even the 60Hz video output of many game consoles would not be a limit, you could just calculate more frames to reach 144Hz or any value your computer can keep up with.\n One crucial thing that needs to be done for this is to identify which vertex in one frame belongs to which vertex in the next. I don't know how the GPU of consoles usually work with triangles and vertices on a technical level. Maybe the games just send the updated coordinates for each vertex, then it would be easy. If games send completely new triangle information (with color and texture information) every frame, then I guess it would be a lot harder. But I think it should still be possible by using some heuristic that looks at the size, texture and change in position and finds a mapping that results a (approximated) minimal overall change in size and position (and no texture change) of triangles. And if the changes become to big (when an object moves or grows really fast) and the mapping becomes too ambiguous, it would not do the interpolation for the affected triangles. That calculation would of course create a performance overhead but I feel like with modern GPUs it should work for old games.\n I understand that creating 60 fps hacks gives better results and is a cleaner approach, but it has to be done individually for each game and is not trivial and I don't know if you even can go beyond 60 fps with this, so I think it would be nice to have this automatic fps increase option in emulators (or even old non-emulated games) to play everything with 144 fps.

I just can't seem to figure out the correct way to draw Pac-Man though! (Testing with Midway arcade ROMs)\n I'm getting the tile data. If I use the two bits per pixel I get from character ROM and just treat that as a grayscale image, I get a totally recognizable display! I see the words on the title screen, I see the maze. That part's working.\n  charval = ROM_gfx[val * 16 + idx]; pixel[0] = (charval & 0x01) | ((charval & 0x10) >> 3); pixel[1] = ((charval & 0x02) >> 2) | ((charval & 0x20) >> 4); pixel[2] = ((charval & 0x04) >> 3) | ((charval & 0x40) >> 5); pixel[3] = ((charval & 0x08) >> 4) | ((charval & 0x80) >> 6); \n Where val is a byte out of the char RAM and ROM_gfx[] is the character ROM array. No problem!\n But what's the correct way to get the full color? There's color RAM just above char RAM. I believe I'm supposed to use the same offset in there for the tile as I do for the char RAM. Then left shift it by 2 and OR the values from the pixel array above?\n Then there's a color ROM and a palette ROM. I thought I was supposed to index palette ROM from the result I got from the above, and then I use that value to index the color ROM which gives me the RGB values?\n That's what I'm trying, and it just looks like a mess.

While previous projects have brought many games to a playable state over the years, many audio and visual effects end up getting lost lost in translation. With these recops projects, were now able to get fully intact ports of these games in all their glory with plenty of enhancements as well.\n  \nZelda64 Recomp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywWwUuWRgsM\n  \nWith there now being a healthy interest for N64 from both fans and developers regarding these recent projects, it got me thinking about other consoles such as the OG Xbox and Sega Saturn that also have a troubled history with emulation progress over the years. How cool would it be to have decomp/recomp projects for games like Jet Set Radio Future and Panzer Dragoon Orta?\n For those of you with experience working on such consoles, how feasible do you see this? Is this something that has piqued the interest of anyone in these communities?\n Looking forward to hear what you guys have to say. Recompilation looks to be a much more accessible alternative to the undertaking that a full decomp entails.\n    submitted by    /u/Agent_Buckshot  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, I'm using that clock to determine when to generate the next audio sample. Is there a better way to do this?\n Currently I generate an entire frame of audio data and then sending that data to SDL when it renders the video frame (~60 audio frames/sec). But I'm having issues finding a good sample rate that divisible by the machine cycles. I did find 264 machine cycles/audio sample, which gives 266 audio samples/frame -> 15,960 audio samples/sec. But this doesn't seem optimal. Any suggestions on how I could improve this?\n  \nEdit: Fixed units in 1. from cycles/sec -> cycles/frame\n    submitted by    /u/dajolly  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys,\n Right now I have several different UI apps which are on different domains.\n I want to move them all to a single domain and separate them by an url path, for example:\n www.foo.bar/grafana\n www.foo.bar/rabbitmq \n The way I've envisioned this is that I'd be using nginx proxy_pass to forward requests to local services with a config like that:\n location /grafana/ { proxy_pass https://grafana.local/; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host; proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding; sub_filter_types *; sub_filter_once off; sub_filter \"src=\\\"\" \"src=\\\"grafana/\" } \n , but I've encountered 2 problems: \n  \nHtml is trying to download resources from base domain, not from domain + path. So for example if there is some element in html having src=\"path/style.css\" browser will try to download from www.foo.bar/path/style.css and not www.foo.bar/grafana/path/style.css. This will obviously fail as nginx won't know what to do with this request.\n This can be dealt with using \"sub_filter\" directive (with some pain) so it's not that bad. However, the next problem is much worse. \n \nRedirects\n The problem is very similar to the previous one. When I go to the grafana index page it redirects me to /login path. The issue is that it will take me to www.foo.bar/login and not www.foo.bar/grafana/login. I haven't found any way of dealing with this and it's preventing me from proceeding. Grafana is kind enough to give you root_url config which is made for situations like these, but rabbitmq or kafka-ui and other services simply don't. \n \n Anyone has any experience with stuff like this? \n    submitted by    /u/Present_You_5294  \n [link]   [comments]",

My current role exposes me to a wide range of tech (AWS, CI/CD, Terraform, GitHub/GitLab, ECS/Docker, Datadog, scripting, etc.) and even some Python work with Data and Analytics teams. However, the one thing missing is that feels substantial (to me?) is Kubernetes (k8s) experience – at a previous role I used it for just over 1 year. Our tech stack is composed mostly of EC2/ASG (bootstrapped with poorly written chef from a company we bought, bleh), Lambda, CDNs, some ECS and API GW.\n I’m 29, and while my current company offers room for advancement to senior roles and beyond, I’m worried that not having more k8s experience, right now, could impact my career for the worse. There’s a possibility we might use Kubernetes in the future as we are in the early stages of migrating most of our applications to containers and ECS, and if the use case for orchestration arises, but it’s not certain.\n Would you recommend jumping to a new job where k8s exposure is guaranteed, or should I stay put and hope for future opportunities with k8s at my current company?\n Looking forward to your advice!\n TL;DR:\n Enjoy my current DevOps job with good pay and growth potential, but lacking Kubernetes exposure.

          "description": "Hi all - \n Started as a Junior 3 years ago, getting ready to switch companies for the first time, and wanted to ask the community's opinion.\n The company I'm leaving has recently (within the past year or so) hired two very senior DevOps Engineers. Both have 10+ YOE. One was hired at a managerial level, one as a Senior (though not staff) Engineer.\n Both have, frankly, struggled. I'm not a typical Junior (had 20+ years of experience in management outside of Tech before moving into an IC role), so even though I've still got a lot to learn about IT, the director and VP have come to me about people management issues, and I keep suggesting caution and patience.\n Every DevOps Engineer that I've seen start with us, it takes about 6 months to get to a level of proficiency where you can start producing individually across the organization. I think that Seniors (and Managers) get a lot shorter of a leash when it comes to this kind of thing - they have higher expectations to 'hit the ground running.' But my experience is that they do not 'ramp' any quicker, and may in fact ramp up more slowly.\n I don't think this is an ageist thing on my part (again: am old), and our most productive DevOps by FAR is a guy who is a 'Super Senior' - he's staff level, has been here for 10+ years, and is a master. But again - he's been here for ten years.\n I was reading a book where a physicist decries that he's 'too old' at 30 to make any major discoveries, and the paradigm of an athlete (where you're cooked after 10-15 years professionally) fit a little too well onto the DevOps Engineers I know.\n TL;DR - Do DevOps's have an expiration date? Is it harder to join a new team when you're more experienced? Or am I just seeing outliers and trying to draw a trend line that doesn't exist?\n    submitted by    /u/BigNavy  \n [link]   [comments]",

My company are transitioning from a monolithic architecture to breaking this up into microservices for future scaling and deployment of individual components. \n We already have broken a few services out of the monolith into independant microservices, but there are now plans to do all.

Is the best route to break up the monolith and after everything is running as its own docker container, port this to k8s, or is it better to transition the current microservices to k8s and the break up the monolith and add to the kubernetes cluster as I go? \n I ask because both routes involve a lot of work, and anyone with a bit of experience of doing something similar in the past can share any knowledge or do's/don'ts when approaching this.

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I'm investigating how to set up integration tests in our project, we do not have any tests in place at the moment. We are using NodeJS/NestJS on the backend side, and everything is deployed as AWS lambdas using a serverless framework. We use Postgres SQL database.\n What I've discovered so far is that there are a couple of ways how can you implement integration tests but there are still some uncertainties.\n First option: Running integration tests during CI/CD\n  \nThe issue here is that our build already takes ~10-15-20 minutes. So it would additionally slow it down even more. Also, we would need to spawn a new environment (not all services, part of the services that are needed for integration tests, database, etc.) before the PR gets merged (since you can not run integration tests with new code since the code is not yet deployed). The issue with spawning environments is the serverless framework which does not have an option to do it in regular way (at least I haven't found it). For these purposes, we could use Terraform or AWS SAM but it takes time to switch to these IAAC tools and we need to start using integration tests as soon as possible.\n  \nSecond option: Running integration tests nightly\n  \nThis looks like a better option to me personally since we would use the existing test environment and every night with deployed code we would run integration tests and fix them tomorrow. The downside is that the code that does not work might be deployed anyway, but I don't see an issue with it since we have weekly releases and once code is deployed to a specific environment we leave it there for ~7 days.\n  \nI would appreciate your opinion or advice on which practices to implement and apply and if you think that my favorite option (second option) is not the best approach here.\n Also, I assume for NodeJS/NestJS we should just Jest testing framework?\n    submitted by    /u/vidara15  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "BACKGROUND\n I've been a (Windows) software developer a long time (decades) and now work, by choice, in DevOps\n My responsibility has been a set of important corporate legacy apps running on Windows (.Net/IIS/SQLServer)\n Everything is on AWS and deployed via Jenkins/Terraform/Ansible/PowerShell scripts, all under source control\n I'm dealing with Linux systems more and more as components of the old system are rewritten/replaced\n CURRENT ISSUE\n I'm finding writing Linux BASH equivalents of Windows PowerShell scripts frustrating\n BASH feels like Windows Command line (BAT) in comparison to PowerShell. Ancient, arcane, not a proper \"language\"\n Having learned Groovy through its use in Jenkins it seems like a great option. Modern, proper \"language\". How can BASH compete with the power of {closure}.delegate?\n But it looks like Groovy has had its day and other than Jenkins isn't widely used. r/Groovy is nearly dead\n (I also have the prospect of our DevOps stack being moved to GitLab in future)\n What would you suggest is a way forward that maximizes my learning effort? (And my learning becomes my teaching for juniors in the department)\n A) Learn BASH. It IS a proper language once you understand it. Its never going away, the skill will always be in demand\n B) Use Groovy. Rumours of its demise are greatly exaggerated.\n C) Get PowerShell on the Linux nodes It's cross-platform for this exact reason. It's 'widely' used (in both Windows and Linux world) The Linux DevOps might roll their eyes but f&*k those insular assholes\n D) Learn \"XYZ Language\" (eg PYTHON?) - that's the thing that fills this gap you're describing and will remain so for a decent amount of time. How did you not know this?\n E) Something else... tell me, eg \"Stop thinking like a developer... DevOps coding is different to Application coding\" (we're gonna have an argument about this are we? ;)\n Because this is Windows v Linux I'm expecting trolls, but I really appreciate any serious replies\n    submitted by    /u/psyFungii  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can now run Brisk yourself both locally (for development/testing purposes) and in your own cloud for free.\n Currently we have dedicated support for Node JS, Ruby, Python and Go test suites and we integrate with Github Actions, CircleCI etc, Bitbucket etc. Adding additional test runners for other languages is also straightforward. \n We also integrate with your IDE so you can access the full power of your CICD pipeline from your local machine after each save. \n Let me know what you think.\n https://github.com/brisktest/brisk\n https://docs.brisktest.com/\n    submitted by    /u/reillyse  \n [link]   [comments]",

While yes there are still cases where you need to debug the control plane, it's extremely rare and 99% of the time, the associated cloud provider has support. \n And yes, it's extremely important to know how the control plane component works.

The only issue is customers of Operations Technology despise Internet Connectivity. Without Internet Connectivity, working with Cloud-Native technologies like Containers is a massive pain.\n So as a common way to solve such a problem I was working with Ansible to setup systems with a Docker Registry and then using container tarballs to do the following:\n  \ndocker pull images from registries\n docker save to create tarballs\n docker load to extract them on the main gateway\n docker tag to make sure I rename it for making it compliant with the registry\n docker push to registry\n cleanup etc.\n  \nThis works well for a single architecture system e.g. amd64. Now I have devices which also are arm64 based and the registry isn't smart enough to generate manifests to let devices determine which blobs to pull based on the underlying architecture.\n I tried Skopeo today and in the lab I was able to sync an Image from Docker Hub to a testing registry in 10s.. No docker gymnastics involved.\n If i need to create tarballs - Skopeo can do that. If I need to push tarballs to a registry it can do that too. Cherry on Top, no need to have docker installed on your local machine where some development is needed.\n I will combine Ansible and Skopeo to get a large leap on the product I am working on.\n The only thing I need to figure out is to generate a Manifest List for multi-arch container images available on Docker Hub\n Amazing tool, would recommend for air-gapped scenarios.\n    submitted by    /u/dugindeep  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My company is choosing OTel as the telemetry framework we are going to adopt. I've been reading about the Otel SDK and Grafana Alloy, and a bit about Prometheus and Loki and I'm trying to understand how these elements reasonably work without any practical experience with them and would appreciate any feedback you have.\n Application w/ SDK --- Collector --- Data backend = This seems to be the recommended components.\n Application w/ SDK - Can push to Collector which will transform the data to export to the data backend.\n The recommended configuration for an Application w/ SDK is to host an agent, which is basically a Collector, on the same host as the application, to handle transmitting OTel to the Collector. \n Q. How bad is it really to run the Application without the agent, and just push with the SDK?\n Q: Is the push model much worse than the pull model? At what level of scale does pull make more sense?\n Q. Does it make sense to mix and match pull metrics, and push traces and logs? The service discovery for pull seems like just another thing to deal with.\n Collector - Can be configured to pull metrics , can it pull logs and traces too?\n Q. Is it as simple as putting a load balancer in front of Collectors, and just have everything blast things to Collectors?\n I would really appreciate any answers to this.

For example, I know how to build docker images using Docker Compose and push them onto DockerHub. I understand how networking works and how to setup persistent volume storage. Would you say this is adequate knowledge for a DevOps role, or should I dive deeper into certain topics?

          "description": "Hi so I've seen a lot of posts discussing similar questions about the best CI/CD but what confuses me is that people a lot of times suggest GitLab CI and GitHub Actions, are they meaning that they should change SCM providers as well? Or are they saying they should create a copy of their repository in GitLab/GitHub and pay the costs of two providers just to use the pipeline? Currently I'm in a team using Jira and Confluence so I think it makes sense for us to go with BitBucket since code review can easily be done in a way that ties to user stories and it is discounted with our other Atlassian products. Why don't more people that use Jira use BitBucket? And what is the best option for a company using Jira? Do we copy our BitBucket repo to GitLab, do we use GitLab and use a Jira integration but still not have our code review be able to be tied to user stories, or do we use a CI/CD manager like Jenkins which most people agree is complex to manage? What are other people doing for this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/carlordvr  \n [link]   [comments]",

A 15YOE replacement was hired and it was immediately obvious they could only deliver at a junior level. I advised the manager to get rid of them before their probation period was up. They wanted to give them a chance to improve, which hasn’t come to fruition. Once they pass probation, you can’t fire people without cause in my country.\n Start of the year, budget cuts happen and the remaining two seniors (who were contractors) have their contract ended. A fresh grad devops engineer is recruited. Team now consists of: myself as lead, mid with ~6YOE, junior with ~3YOE, junior with 15YOE, junior with ~0.5YOE.\n I’m getting smashed from all sides. Interacting with the business, being the sole senior engineer, handling a lot of the devops work since it’s moderately complex and a fresh grad is way over their head here. I’d hoped the mid level would rise up but it’s becoming clear that mid level could potentially be their peak. Struggling to keep the lights on let alone have time to grow the other members. Recent feedback from the engineers is that they need cards to have more detail for implementation (which is part of my role) so I feel like I am struggling to perform my core responsibility.\n Recent restructuring has brought in a new manager who asked if I want to go back to being an IC. Do I throw in the towel and wait for an opportunity with better support to dip my toes into the leadership path again? Or continue; but focussing on my core roles and letting the cracks I’ve been papering over widen?\n    submitted by    /u/hallucinogen_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know it's a lot of work for a single person, but just creating a an hello world example of a distributed system with basic functionality from each component. \n Or is system design mostly theoretical thing and designer should delegate implementation to other people/teams with their expertise in each part of the system?\n What are your thoughts on this and did you actually try to do it for yourself (ie. learning purposes)?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/SherbetOrganic  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also, test that an existing system (old version) can be upgraded with the latest version of your infra-code.\n But those deployments can take a long time.

He also has a great sense of humour, and this talk is much funnier to me that stand-up comedy. \n https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/05/11/please-stop-calling-databases-cp-or-ap.html\n This is an article by the great Martin Kleppman, the author of Designing Data Intensive Applications where he basically criticizes the existing strange marketing-based treatment of the CAP theorem. This is also coverredt in the book, but in a slightly less detailed way. \n I have more articles that I come back to occasionally, but this is the one that I immediately thought about. \n What are your favorites and, most interestingly, why?\n    submitted by    /u/dondraper36  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some don't even really understand JOINs apart from the inner one. \n My personal source of shame is how I used deployed a service that repeatedly executes fat queries in BQ, but didn't really introduce any retries, backoffs and alerting. Needless to say, the queries turned out to be costly. \n What are your observations?\n    submitted by    /u/dondraper36  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since I've started getting more comfortable in our code base i feel like I am holding back our Merge Request process by addressing various problems in my colleague's MRs. Sometimes the discussions go on for days or weeks before we come to a consensus. My personal feeling is that my colleague is sometimes very shortsighted in what he is developing and is focussing on solving symptoms instead of root causes. I prioritize code quality and try to enforce certain standard throughout our code base in order to make maintenance work easier. Should I trust my colleague's work more?

Out dev environment is essentially a large number of pods spun up, each representing a service or service component. Seems simple enough — unfortunately in practice it’s not.\n I need 350 pods spun up to do feature development. In a best case scenario, this takes about 20 minutes. In a usual case scenario, this takes 20 minutes + 1 hour of troubleshooting random regressions/pods spinning up wrong/etc. In a bad case scenario, this takes literally days.\n For simple features I’ve taken to just testin’ in prod, but this isn’t sustainable. Simple feature work is hamstrung by the hell I have to go through to get anything working locally, which is infuriating because by the time I have a testing env setup stuff is usually trivial. Anyone here gone through anything similar? 8YOE, this is clunkiest setup I’ve ever had to deal with \n EDIT: clearing up a misconception I’m seeing — there are not 350 microservices, there are 350 pods. Some services have different pods, ie DBs etc etc. there are probably around 50 different services. My service doesn’t talk to all of them — think of it as a dependency DAG, where if service A depends on service B, and service B depends on service C, all three are spun up to access service A locally.\n    submitted by    /u/p_tk_d  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Ever since AI has hit the scene, we have been having issues where developers blame mistakes they are making on the AI generating the wrong code.\n I have people saying \"oh well chatgpt generated it wrong\" when a bug reaches prod instead of being accountable to their own work. And they can't debug their own work because they don't understand how it works either, so I have to troubleshoot it as well.\n Another issue I have is during code reviews, people cannot explain why they wrote their code a certain way. They just say \"that's what chatgpt output\". And it's usually just several long functions with minimal thought going into the design or how it will work in the bigger picture. One project is using 3 or 4 different libraries for making http requests at this point because chatgpt isn't consistent in which it uses and devs arent checking to see what is already in place. \n The other thing people started doing is responding with a copy paste from chatgpt explaining the design when answering my PR comments. Even if the explanation feels nonsensical from my perspective, they just copy paste spam clearly generated replies until I give up and pass the review over to someone else.\n Ive talked to my boss but hes drunk on AI hype and thinks this is the future. I explain these issues but he thinks I am just trying to force people into doing things the old way. His favorite thing to say is that people originally opposed using compilers and wanted to hand write assembly for a long time, which i find pretty annoying.

Hopefully, based on the upvotes, this is fine :) \n I have finally read all the responses in that thread about the tips for writing better code. A lot of people mentioned testing, but the opinions themselves were really different. \n My recent project proved to me that unit tests are very tricky to get right. It's very simple to write them and increase the coveted code coverage so that fellow devs can applaud and be confident that something good is happening. That said, a lot of tests are either meaningless in that they pass whatever what, or so flaky that maintaining them becomes such a burden that you just want to delete them. \n Recently, it has happened several times that I just ditched all unit tests and mocks and fired testcontainers with a real PG instance. \n Of course, unit tests have their place for business logic where no external dependencies are involved. In such cases, it also helps to use fuzzy testing and property-based testing. \n Now I am rereading the wonderful article by Fowler on tests, but I am sure some of you might have a lot of insightful things to say on the topic.\n    submitted by    /u/dondraper36  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm of the mind that if you have 2 variables or sets of data that should ALWAYS be the same, that you SHOULD (assuming some huge hurdle) that you should have a source of truth that feeds both or one passes it to the other.\n For example, if you click a button (\"foo\") and need to call a method (\"bar\") that passes that button's value to somewhere else, you should change the code so \"foo\" is in a variable somewhere and passed to \"bar\" as opposed to hard coding \"foo\" inside \"bar\"\n But this can obviously end up with writing more code so that the foo variable is getting passed around.\n So this tech lead seems to be of the mindset that you should always change the least amount of code possible regardless of anything else. I mean I get this perspective, but it seems insanely short sighted.\n Am I the crazy one here?

I was allocated two other developers (3 and 5 YOE respectively) in addition to myself. I have been having trouble with both. One has taken several months to do something that would normally take tops two weeks. I have been constantly allocating time to help him. I eventually gave up around a month and a half in and asked my manager to step in and help. For the other developer, he will always say he will help in team channels, but when it comes to picking up task that aren’t interesting or that I specifically asked him to do he will try and do other things. So I had to ask my manager to have him not deviate from the plan as well. \n The problem is, I’m still stuck in the same boat and where I have one bad developer who doesn’t care and another one who I have to specifically delegate to. He knows there is work to do. I have made the tasks ahead of time and broken the project into small chunks. He also knows what the priorities are and how much work is left. I have a weekly meeting with them to discuss that. \n I’m at a point where I told my boss that I don’t think it’s my job to babysit the developers on the team. We have a plan, a schedule and they are adults. If the project is delayed, you have heard explicitly why.\n How do I manage this situation better because it’s driving me bonkers. I honestly don’t want to work with these developers, because they don’t respect that I’m trying to do a good job at work and they are inadvertently impacting me. \n    submitted by    /u/ChangeShortage  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Okay, let me clarify. In the thread about overrated concepts, several people mentioned Uncle Bob and clean code. Again, the principles behind the rules are very useful. After all, software engineering is fighting complexity almost by definition. \n That said, because of the tone and Uncle Bob's authority, those out-of-nowhere rules like \"methods can't be longer than 5 LOC\" or \"methods can't have more than one parameter\" became associated with clean code. \n A much better book on writing great code is A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout. What I like the most is that John has a very nuanced view on software design, and instead of magic numbers and prohibitions he comes up with useful ideas like deep/shallow modules. This single chapter made me rethink how I write code and think about complexity. \n As for less philosophical rukes, there's a favorite of mine that in my opinion tremendously improves average code. It's guard clauses or, simply speaking, early returns. I know, there used to be the opinion rooted in old programming languages that a routine must have only one return. This is fortunately no longer true, and in the language I use 99% of the time (Go) , returning early is one one of the common best practices. \n What are your favourites?\n    submitted by    /u/dondraper36  \n [link]   [comments]",

Many things I've read there continue to echo in my head.\n So this is a book about decision making. The authors researched business decision making primarily, but many of the findings make sense in the context of decisions that developers, especially lead devs regularly make.\n The book mentions common known biases in decision making, such as the famous sunk cost fallacy or loss aversion. But what I like really about the book is that it goes way beyond that and focuses on the process of decision making.\n One of the recommendations is to apply a wide context. For example, instead of asking whether the team should do a certain refactor and discussing pros and cons, a better question is: what can the team do in the X engineering hours granted to code maintenance.\n Another interesting advice was that decision makers should actively reach out for opinions that oppose their preferred choice. If you don’t see any disadvantages with the decision, then chances are you didn’t spend enough time to discover your blind spots, and efforts should be made to at least give a chance for counteropinions.\n Another practice mentioned is preparing for failure: what happens if the decision doesn’t bring the expected outcome? If we start this refactor, what do we do if it gets more complicated than we anticipated? When do we stop it? Do we have a clear way of undoing changes, if necessary? What if our changes designed to improve performance turn out to have a catastrophic effect in production?\n I also really like the pragmatic approach they’ve taken: they collected and analyzed hard data to see what decision making practices correlate with better outcomes.\n Have you read other books that are not really focused on software engineering, but contributed to your practices?\n    submitted by    /u/my_dev_acc  \n [link]   [comments]",

The thread has some insightful stories and arguments, but I still feel like the hype around microservices did the industry a bad favor. \n MongoDB (closely related to the PG point below). I have several times heard my colleagues discuss MongoDB and want to use it at work. Every single time, my immediate reaction was to ask why and suggest using Postgres instead with its JSONB columns.\n Clean/hexagonal architecture - I think that the underlying ideas (dependency inversion, single responsibility and the rest of SOLID) are great ways to reason about architecture. That said, the marketing hype about clean architecture seems to have created a cult of religious fans to the point where abstractions and layers of indirection are created just because that follows what Uncle Bob wrote in his article. Also, the popular argument of \"now we can swap the database every day\" is so unrealistic in my opinion. I don't really remember ever needing to unexpectedly swap a database. Maybe, I'm wrong. \n Underrated: \n Postgresql - even though it has a great reputation these days, I still think a lot of people would benefit a lot from knowing more about its features and potential. My personal favorite is using PG's FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED feature to implement a simple queue. Whenever I need a task queue, I immediately reach for it. \n Presentation/writing skills: I am not a great presenter and speaker myself, but the more I work as a software engineer, the more I realize that being concise, accurate, and engaging in your writing/speaking is a valuable asset.

The goal is to develop an abstract API that centralizes payment requests and forwards them to the appropriate payment gateway for processing. Essentially, this is similar to what Adyen does with various payment processors.\n One of our senior developers suggested using a microservices architecture for this project. In this setup, one microservice would receive the payment requests, and there would be separate microservices for each payment method we use. These microservices would then communicate with the respective payment gateways.\n I believe that Adyen and other payment gateways might use a similar approach in their systems.\n Here are my questions:\n  \nHow do payment gateways handle communication between their internal services?\n Is the communication entirely synchronous, with microservices calling each other using HTTP?\n Do they use message queues? If so, how do they ensure the process appears synchronous to the client? For example, when I make a payment request to Adyen, they return the status in the same response.\n  \nThanks for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/RaphaS9  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can handle the technical stuff, I can figure out solutions and paths to complex problems and code them, or if I can't, I know how to find the right people and the right knowledge to see my project through.\n The problem is that there are only so many things one can do, eventually, if the task is monumental, you become a bottle neck. This is where this whole \"scaling through others\" comes in.\n A good \"senior\" or \"lead engineer\" is a force multiplier greater than 1. A bad one is a bottle neck.\n So I was in the unfortunate situation where i had to lead a team who overall lacked the right kind of skillset for what the project demanded. We did deliver on time, but it was very stressful for me, and there's still a lot of things that need to be refined yet. \n So I guess the question is, how do help your team deliver when they lack a lot of the basics for the given domain? My team was mostly backend and infrastructure engineers, and they now need to work on something related to compilers and software analysis.\n Had it been just me, the project would have taken a month, but with a team it took 4 times longer, and there's still too much friction in certain areas. Granted long term there are 5 engineers who can work on it vs 1, which is positive, but still, it was a struggle.\n I have the hunch that building a core / skeleton and then having people explore / solve isolated problems is the right way to go, but then people find excuses or avoid diving in the codebase. \n    submitted by    /u/dangling-putter  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now this sounds simple enough: All records in a set of known tables (ie our event tables) with timestamp age > 5 years should be hard deleted. Plus any associated blob storage NoSQL dbs as well (using ids from the relational database). Let's ignore the implications of distributed systems and stay solely within a singular db.\n The tricky part was, how do you stop engineers submitting code that breaks this rule? For a more concrete example, a dev adds a new or modifies an existing sql table FOO with no foreign key to the previously concerned tables, but on event creation, FOO will now have some event related data (possibly transformed/hashed so it's completely unrecogniseable from original event data, but must still be deleted)?\n It's simple to say Code Review, but I'm looking for basically as robust a solution here, preferably as part of the CI pipeline (eg github actions). Here are some things I thought of, but kind of got stumped towards the end when data can't be recognised.\n  \nStatic Analysis to recognise new tables -> code review carefully\n Static Analysis to see if the inputs, are eventually used on any tables not in an existing 'vetted' list (I assume this is possible)\n Stand up a db via docker, then see what tables change when an event is created, if not on a vetted list, alert. This might be through inspection of logs, or using some Change Data Capture lib to help.\n  \nI really liked the last one, but maybe there's some fundamental stuff I'm missing.

There's one group of (sharp) senior devs that have been working with it a long time, and a second off-shore group that is significantly less experienced. Experienced group likes one IDE; new group has been told to use a different IDE (and a few rebels (me!) use a third).\n I have two main concerns that I'm hoping the tool can help with: code formatting consistency across multiple IDEs (PR noise), and coding apprenticeship factors (\"Don't copy that, it's not a good example\"). I am tired of PRs where I'm looking for NPEs, seeing 'if' statements that are 8 levels deep, and getting distracted by code moving from one line to the next because the line continuation moved. I'm hoping a lint-as-you-type tool would help with these types of issues, but I'm a bit overwhelmed on how to push it out. The new group is probably amenable, but the old group maybe not so much.\n Likely a phased approach is best, carrots over sticks, but what to prioritize in phase 1? Server side counts, or just let early adoption happen locally amongst the willing? Identifying & disabling the rules that generate too much noise?

          "description": "This is mainly for people working at a large company, as I imagine this would be less of an issue at a startup where everyone knows each other.\n My name is circulated semi-often as someone to contact when help is needed to fix issues in testing environments. From time to time, when someone reaches out to me for help, this is the entire message they send:\n  \nHello u/idemockle\n  \nI have never talked to or heard of this person before, let alone know what they work on, so naturally I don't respond immediately. This greeting message is left to sit for hours before the person tries to reach out again, and most of the time, when they do reach out again, they still do not give any introduction or background into what they want.\n Any tips on how to deal with this behavior? I feel kind of bad just not responding, but I also find it incredibly rude to reach out to someone you don't know for help then make them have to pull teeth to get any information about it. Usually, I don't respond until they give more context (if they ever do).\n I'm curious if others on here have encountered the same thing, if you think not responding is justified, and if not, then what you do to get the information you need in order to help without wasting a bunch of time on a back and forth.\n    submitted by    /u/idemockle  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I say PM I need the one who is supposed to do requirement analysis and translation. Whatever the title is -- sometimes it's called Business Analyst too I think.\n Basically, I have never met even one good PM (or whatever you call it) in my 6+ years of experience. I think a good PM should worth the salary of one dev + one business side, and probably more if applicable.\n Sometimes I wonder why it is so difficult to grow one good PM. I suspect it has something to do with how corporations grow. In the beginning there is usually no middle man, and devs directly talk to the business. This is fine when it is still small -- but then business grows and experienced devs/business either leave or just care about their own stuffs. Then corp realizes that it needs some middle men -- but they rarely hire devs/businesses from the rank, instead hiring from externals -- those people might be good PM in their previous companies, but they are sort of useless in the new environment because each one has its own communication \"flavors\". Then it needs another 2-3 years to grow those PMs, but how can they learn effectively if they neither go through business nor dev? It's going to take much longer to learn the rope -- and that's why we see so many echo chambers instead -- it's not their fault, because they are not experienced in this specific environment, what else can they do?\n That leaves my conclusion that a company should always hire PM from experienced internal business or devs instead, and PM should be a senior position -- there should be no \"junior\" PM positions.

          "description": "Encountering this problem a lot lately:\n Say I have an entity and a kafka topic related to that entity.\n I need to publish an event related to that entity once, and prevent further attempts to publish.\n I can have a \"published\" column in my db that I check before publishing the event.\n If !published, proceed to publish the event, then update published = true for that row.\n The problem: if my publish succeeds, but my update fails, the column remains false for that row. If another publish attempt occurs, I will read !published again and try to publish when I shouldn't.\n I could update the published column before the publish has occurred, but 1) this is an anti pattern since the publish hasn't occurred yet and 2) if the db update succeeds but the publish fails, I'll again have a column that is inaccurate.\n I suppose in this particular circumstance I could just roll back the db update - but that could also fail.\n If this happens 25,000 times in one day, I need to know which ones are inaccurate etc.\n Are there more sophisticated/elegant ways for handling this sort of problem?\n Edit:\n Thanks everyone for all the feedback. I guess I should add: there is UI involvement here where we want to allow the user to take the action that causes the publish only once. We want to disallow taking that action on the UI more than once. We also want to enforce the constraint in the backend. IMO it is bad design to let the user believe they can take action when they can't. We could let them sit there and click buttons all day and just let the backend decide and return an error code when they shouldn't have initiated the action, or we could stop them from taking the action in the first place which is what we're doing.\n    submitted by    /u/lsrwlf  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a non-tech company in a lucrative industry.\n The work is generally easy but I am the only developer in the organization. As such, the work I do is often glueing their SaaS products together in some way or building small internal tools for my stakeholders. Don't really exercise my dev muscles often and the easiest (least complicated) solution is often the best one for their needs.\n The pay is great and generally the WLB is comfortable, but I don't work with any other devs and really feel my skills deprecating over time. The pay is at the top-end of what my expected range would be like so it's difficult to make a change without taking a pay cut. I worry that whenever this engagement ends (they always do), I will be a much worse dev than I was prior to working here.

          "description": "So we have a fairly new CTO thats pushing for various different process changes in dev teams. \n Two of these is trunk based development and full time pair programming to enable CI/CD. \n For context my team looks after a critical area of our platforms (the type where if we screw up serious money can be lost and we'll have regulators to answer to). We commit to repos that are contributed to by multiple teams and basically use a simplified version of Gitflow with feature branches merging into master only when fully reviewed & tested and considered prod ready. Once merged to master the change is released to prod. \n From time to time we do pair programming but tend to only do it when it's crunch time where necessary. The new process basically wants this full time. Devs have trialed this and feel burned out doing the pair programming all day everyday. \n Basically I ran my team on the idea of trunk based development and they're heavily against it including the senior devs (one of whom called it 'madness'). \n The main issue from their perspective is they consider it risky and few others don't think it will actually improve anything. I'm not entirely clued up on where manual QA testing fits into the process either but what I've read suggests this takes place after merge to master & even release which is a big concern for the team. Devs know that manual QA's capture important bugs via non-happy paths despite having a lot of automated tests and 100% code coverage. We already use feature flags for our projects so that we only expose this to clients when ready but devs know this isn't full proof.\n We've spoken about perhaps trialing this with older non-critical apps (which didn't get much buy in) and changes are rarely needed on these apps so I don't see us actually being able to do this any time soon whereas the CTO (and leadership below) is very keen for all teams to take this all on by this summer.\n    submitted by    /u/rjm101  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately there is zero data locality, everything is layered horizontally (persistence service, entity A logic service, entity B logic service, etc) and everything depends on everything else. Services keep each in other sync via synchronous RPC over network. In short, it's a distributed monolith.\n The project has progressed too far to make major architecture changes, and we need to move fast.\n We will soon have the foreseeable issue that keeping state synchronized across multiple distributed services and databases is hard. I shudder to think how the current system would behave during outages, and the many inconsistent states it will get in. I fear that if we don't intervene now, it will turn into a maintenance nightmare on release.\n If you've been in a similar situation, which eventual consistency pattern did you go with, and what was your experience? My main concern is keeping implementation overhead as low as possible. I've thought about the usual at-least-once event-driven + idempotency route, but I'm worried about the overhead during day-to-day development, and amount of changes required to even get started with that.

When teams have changing managers, they might end up having to explain basic things about their work to the newcoming manager.

While doing this, I realised the more junior dev had missed a lot of functionality and requirements in his build. So he was taken off the project and I was assigned to do a non-billable rework.\n For context, I am a Salesforce developer and the project is complex integration. The client insisted we use a 3rd party tool and deliver the project using SSIS packages. I was not involved at the start or in the sales cycle so had no opportunity to argue against this. I have no experience using SSIS packages and neither does anyone in our company. This isn't a project we should have taken on. \n I have been working for a couple of weeks to try to save the project but at this point I don't think I can do it. I don't have enough knowledge on SSIS packages and the 3rd party software the client wants us to use. I have learned a lot about them but at this point, the skills required to deliver are not ones I have and I don't have a lot of time to really learn them. \n Does anyone else have experiences like this? I pride myself on being able to teach myself and adapt so it doesn't feel great to admit I'm not capable.\n UPDATE: There is some really great advice in this thread and it's good to know I am not the only one this has happened to. I took some of the advice here on board and had a meeting with my deliver director and PM lead where I explained the problem and gave some solutions rather than a flat out \"I can't do this\". These included me taking extra time to learn about SSIS, hiring a contractor or restructuring the project into a more manageable phased approach.

For almost a year I've been a part of a leadership program to help get me promoted to lead. I've gotten a lot of positive feedback along the way and told that I'm making great progress. According to my manager, because of some of the work that we have coming up in the near future 1. that senior role that I mentioned got bumped to lead (we already have a lead) and 2. they made a pitch for me but ultimate was denied by my skip because there's a \"local\" candidate in the pipeline.\n All things considered I'm taking it in stride. I wasn't expecting to be promoted this soon anyway and this unfortunately lines up with the company direction of moving to more in-office / hybrid. There are a bunch of people that were hired (and still are) remote - seniors / leads / principals / managers / directors - one of whom is my manager. Most people still don't go into the office except on rare occasions like vertical get togethers where remote folks fly in too.\n I really enjoy working for the company that I do, so the game plan for now is just to keep kicking butt and make myself undeniable for promo. Looking elsewhere for a lead / staff job has crossed my mind, but I have an agreement with myself that I'll wait until 5 years before doing that (currently sitting at 3 and some change at my current level). Moving back to where the company is based out of has also crossed my mind - I used to live there, but moved back to my home state to be closer to family during the pandemic.\n I'm curious - have y'all run into similar situations? How have you handled it? Also, I have a 1 on 1 with my skip level in a month who denied my promo. Any tips? They're new to me because of a re-org, so it'll be the first time we've met.

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n I'm just a solo developer who at the end of last year, released my first game called \"Fableverse\" and it was definitely a tough but very fun experience. I definitely learned a ton from the process. I built my own framework in JavaScript + React + Electron, which is something I haven't done before. I learned how to integrate into Steam and build something from start to finish (which is something I REALLY struggled with). \n I know everyone loves numbers, so I wanted to provide a few for those who find it interesting. To date, I've sold about 4,400 copies of my game, with currently 4K wishlists. That's about $13.4K in gross revenue and about $9380 is what I see of that. Of that amount, I'm saving about $2345 (~25% of what I earned) for taxes. I think that's about $7K I actually…",

I feel like the game is now a much different product than what it was 3 years ago when it was first released, with a ton more features and contents included in the base game (not counting the contents added in the six DLCs). \n Also since the game has been out for three years, most of the videos/screenshots people have been sharing are of the \"old looks\", so I'd love to distinguish from that.\n Now that I feel like I am done updating this game and ready to move on to the sequel, I wonder whether it makes sense to give the game a new \"identity\" by calling it XXXX: XXXXX Enhanced Edition. Do you think this is a good idea, or has this practice been used too much in the gaming industry? It's like every other 5-year old game out there has an \"Enhanced Edition\", \"Director's Cut\" etc. lol\n    submitted by    /u/Rotorist  \n [link]   [comments]",

One in perticular that still makes me chuckle is telling us we'd failed as game devs because we insisted we should include a mouse sensitivity slider for our game. We were told that the mouse sensitivity should be perfect! and no one should have any need to adjust their mouse sensitity for the game.\n We had to explain that people prefer different mouse sensitivities and not one setting fits everyone. We had a perfect example among our dev team. Me using a edpi of around 2400 and another developer using a edpi of around 400. Needless to say we were never allowed to add a mouse sensitivity slider because according to that senior staff member we were wrong in thinking we needed one. The company is now closed down.\n In general it was like they hated the idea of giving the player any way of changing anything in options, and this is only one example. I just thought that this was a hilarious one that got brought up.\n    submitted by    /u/Plus-Pie3898  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can confidently say it had no impact whatsoever. I did get a huge spike in direct navigation, but the sales yesterday were actually at some of the lowest of the week. I saw someone say in the comments \"I can't buy it because it costs 100.000\". Which translates to $3.7. The normal price of the game is $7 in USA. This is Steam's auto conversion which they recommend. I suppose this is a Vietnamese thing, but still so strange to see literally no one buy it when the youtuber is having a great time.\n Edit: As a commentor said, Steam is currently banned in Vietnam. I'm devastated.\n Edit2: People told me to put the name and link in the post.

          "description": "Take the most simple idea you can possibly imagine.\n Simplify it more, it's still way too complicated.\n Don't start from making art. Do a playable prototype using most basic 2d or 3d shapes. Gameplay first. There are some exceptions, but this approach wouldn't hurt them either.\n Make sure the prototype you've made is good enough to reflect your desired gameplay on 80-90%.\n After - look at your prototype with a very new look, and think once again of the MOST simple art style that could represent your idea \"well enough\". Replace simple shapes with some assets. Don't be afraid of using Assetstore or other places to buy/get your assets if they fit. No-one really cares about their originality as long if it fits and it's fun.\n Register pages for all important social media the day you start. Post everything you do there, start getting some followers. Remember, making a game is always much longer process then you expect, the game you want to make in 2 weeks may take 2 month, may take 2 years. Before you finish - you'll have some audience to start with. If you start late - you will regret not starting at once. It will take months of daily posting just to make it a habit, so it's much better to start at day 1.\n The hardest thing in making a game is 'completing and releasing' it. Make this your main goal and priority. Everything else goes second.\n  \np.s. This strategy works not only for the 1st game, but I'd stick to it in general.

You still have to pay them!\n Answer: Of coarse I have to pay them. I already did. I need to know whether the art is AI or not because submitting AI art can get me in trouble with certain platform holders, especially if I don't disclose it on the AI survey form which is required for game submissions. If it is AI, then I would simply hire another person to replace the images with a new batch.

          "description": "I recently stumbled upon a Reddit post where someone was struggling to come up with a name for their game. It got me thinking about our own journey to naming “Castle of Blackwater” and the memories came flooding back. Naming a game is no small feat, and it was quite challange for us too. \n We knew from the start that we wanted to create a social deduction game. During the Christmas holiday, I traveled to Spain and spent some time working on different concepts. I explored a few ideas: one had a medieval theme, another was more temple-like, and the last concept revolved around a magical castle. The magical castle vibe resonated with us, so I immediately started writing the backstory and drafted the first two chapters. It was during this process that I envisioned a magical river with black water, which became a key element in the lore. \n After returning from my trip, I sat down with my co-founder to brainstorm the name. This process took quite a while. We thought “Blackwater” sounded catchy and had a certain allure and mystery to it. Our first idea was “Battle of Blackwater,” but a quick Google search led us straight to a Game of Thrones episode. Clearly, we couldn’t use that. \n Finally, we landed on “Castle of Blackwater,” and it just felt right. It’s been quite some time since then, and now we’re gearing up for our Steam launch at the end of 2024. It’s funny to think back on those days and see how far we’ve come. \n Now, I’m curious how did you come up with the name for your game or username? Or maybe you have a funny story about how you created your online identity?\n Curious to know!\n    submitted by    /u/Castle_Of_Blackwater  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I had been working in a company for about 2 years. We tried to develop two different projects, but the projects never saw the light of day because there were problems with project and team management. About 2 weeks ago, I started treatment for 3 hernias in my lower back, during this process, the doctor told me that I shouldn't sit for too long, but I still tried to close the deficiencies in the project. And this morning I learned that I was fired from work with a phone call. I'm not angry about being fired, but I'm angry that the project I worked on was taken away from me, I was suddenly removed from the organisation on github, I was kicked out of the discord server, there are really very bad people in this world. By the way, although my main job is Game play programmer, I was also working in 3d modelling, animation and texturing to cover the deficits in the company. I just wanted to get it off my chest.\n EDIT Thank you good people thank you\n    submitted by    /u/trueeeebruhmoment  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just to give some background, it's a freemium mobile word game with $5 premium option (includes extras, ad removal and access to an extra game mode). \n I'm just having trouble understanding that mentality... Why does it seem like most people will pay $10 for a Frappuccino they'll enjoy for five minutes but expect a mobile game they can theoretically play forever to be free? And then if it is free, they complain about the ads?\n Is it the mobile game market that has set those expectations? Is it the non-traditional casual gamers who are less willing to pay for games in general (which doesn't make logical sense to me - if you like something, you should be willing to pay for it, imo). Is it something else?\n Admittedly, I'm not the most savvy business person... just a designer/developer who enjoys making stuff. But I feel the product is worth way more than $5 so it's really disappointing when I read a paradoxical review that simultaneously raves about the quality of the game and treats it like it's worthless.

Is there a certain stage of development where it makes sense to start releasing footage of it for marketing purposes? Is it paranoid to be afraid of one's idea getting stolen? Please share any thoughts on this subject.\n I have been developing a game full-time for almost a year by myself. The game is an idea that I have had for a while and that I believe to be both original and eye-catching. I myself enjoy playing what I have created so far, and friends and family that have played have also had the reaction that I was hoping for.\n As of now I have been keeping my game very close to the chest. But I am currently considering looking for investments in my game and then I would obviously have to share everything about it. I am not super scared that a potential investor would steal it, since I would try to only approach serious actors but if you have any thoughts on this please share them.\n Edit:\n Thank you all for your input! But all I see is a bunch of people trying to convince me to share my idea so they can steal it.. /s No, but for real, I really appreciate all your views and I hear what many of you are saying about the importance of exposure and the low likelihood that anyone will put in the effort to steal something that has not yet been proven. I will rethink my approach and will share my game sooner than I intended. But first I want to have a few more features in place and some minimal polishing as well.

          "description": "I've been working on my game for around 2-3 years. There were times when I was anxious about negative feedback and the lack of wishlists. But 2 days ago, I launched my game. Here's what I'm feeling right now.\n Firstly, I feel relaxed and calm. I'm also missing the sense of \"I have work to do\", which was a huge part of my life every day for the last few years. All that tension is gone. I feel empty, but in a good way. I'm still getting used to the feeling of having nothing to do.\n Yesterday, a few hours after launch, I went out and met some friends and had a good time. I didn't think about my game at all (which was weird to be honest). Today, I cleared out some old junk in my \"studio\". I also wiped clean the white board I used to write my daily to-do lists. It's blank for the first time in many years. That's exactly how I am feeling.\n I know there's still work to do with regard to promotions and fixing game issues as and when they come up. But I know for a fact that the actual mountain of gamedev work has been conquered. This feeling of knowing I've reached my goal is incredible. Guys, I'm not saying it's a high, but it's a high. Not an intense high. But a high nonetheless.\n IMO completing my game and releasing it is the conclusion of my game dev journey, or at least the first of many journeys. Although, the sales have been so-so thus far (don't ask about it), it does feel immensely rewarding to just know that my creation is out there, and that people are playing it! \n Regardless of what happens, I know my future self will look back on these post-launch moments fondly. I think whatever I'm feeling makes the struggle worth it. I also know that if there existed a club for indie devs who have completed and published a game, I'm officially in it.\n Anyway, if you're a new solo indie game developer reading this, trust me when I say that completing an indie game and publishing it is an awesome feeling. In fact, it's a huge achievement in and of itself.\n    submitted by    /u/cs_ptroid  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As a solo dev, I have a commercial game on Steam that hasn't even made back 10% of my investment. Despite being a financial failure, I'm quite proud of the quality and depth of the game. Its genre is a bit hard to describe, so let's go with \"an innovative roguelike/RPG where conflicts are resolved through various, procedurally generated word puzzles\".\n Since the first version, I have published three free content updates (and hotfixes) and responded to all support questions, either by email or on the Steam forum. However, I cannot afford to spend more effort on this game, and I've moved on to other projects.\n Today, a fan asked on the Steam forum if they can expect new stories and game events. I'm not sure how to express that, due to the poor sales, I am unable to provide support beyond bug fixes. I'd rather not ignore the question because it would make the game look completely abandoned.\n    submitted by    /u/SandorHQ  \n [link]   [comments]",

You lose yourself in the flow, and the world fades away and find yourself repeating stuff like: \"Can't hang out, I'm on the verge of a breakthrough\", \"Can we do it tomorrow? Or maybe a week after that?\", \"I'd love to, but i just need to finish something first\". Your friends and loved ones might think you've gone MIA, but you're in your happy place, building something incredible. What do you mean i spend too much time on my computer? Why would i want to go outside? \n Days blend into a blissful blur of code, creativity, and caffeine. What year is this? Who's the president? Did you eat today? Who knows! I really don't have time to think about stuff like that.\n And let's talk about the focus. Anything that pulls you away from your game feels like a distraction from your true calling. A ringing phone? How rude! An unexpected visit? The nerve! Your game demands your full attention, like an engrossing novel you can't put down. \n Finishing and polishing a game? Oh, that's a whole new level of self-inflicted torture. It's a hands-down personal crisis every time. You start questioning your intelligence, your life choices, your sanity. I AM NEVER DOING THIS AGAIN, EVER! You look in the mirror and wonder who that haggard, sleep-deprived zombie is. But as you trudge through the endless bugs and polish sessions, the dust eventually settles. And what do you do? You find yourself prototyping the next game. Because why not repeat the cycle of pain and questionable decisions?\n So here we are, fellow indie devs, riding the rollercoaster of our self-imposed addiction. Here’s to another round of sleepless nights, endless debugging, and the faint hope that this game will be the one.

I understand big gaming companies have a lot of money and resources, but it just baffles me that they can put together such a good looking game. For context I use UE5 for all my projects; have a 4090 RTX, super high quality monitors, and 16GB ram. As soon as I start adding foliage to a large, somewhat open world, my FPS slows down like crazy. To the point that I have to choose trees over grass sometimes as an example. I use LODs, low draw distance, but it doesn’t seem to help. I don’t know how a big company like Ubisoft can throw that much high quality foliage in their game alongside exceptional lighting without destroying the games performance? If any of you work for a company like this can you shed some light on this for me??

          "description": "And finally I got a demo on Steam.\n A little context\n About two years ago I decided to try making a game. It was decided to do a small, but not entirely microscopic project that would bring me satisfaction from its implementation.\n So, throughout these two years, as development progressed, I acquired and improved my skills in order to create something useful. I’m not sure that I expected to do everything much faster, I don’t even remember my initial plans and deadlines, but I already registered the game at 3 demo festivals and successfully canceled the registration, deciding that I could do better. And finally the demo appeared where I had long wanted to see it.\n What is the game about?\n “Defeat/beat people” was conceived as a mixture of tabletop warhammer (in terms of scale it turned out to be more of a kill team offshoot), Xcom and Battle brothers. Naturally, not the ultimate version, but what I can put together on my own, trying to isolate what I like about these games.\n In concept, this is a fairly simple turn-based tactics, without overload with numbers, with customization of units and quick battles that affect the balance of forces within the star system.\n Most of the game was made by me alone. My girlfriend helped with the music, and she has been putting up with this development with me from the very beginning. I was also helped by several people who tested the game and caught bugs when I was no longer physically able to sit at the computer.\n There is still a lot of work ahead. I hope to complete the full version of the game within a few months, but so far the actual development time has always been several times longer than planned.\n    submitted by    /u/reegamesglobal  \n [link]   [comments]",

I watch Captain Planet as a kid, I was a boy-scout and topic of nature preservation is important to me but I wouldn't call myself an activist and my priority is to make this game fun. I setup Steam page and I gather Wishlists. I don't have marketing budget so I post about my game on various social medias. Most of the times feedback is positive but there are some people who really don't like the idea. But not only that. They call me \"leftist r*tard\" \"NWO shill\" and \"pinkhair soyboy\". Someone even suggested that I should make \"H*mas t*rrorist Simulator\" next. I don't take those words lightly. All I wanted is to make a game about rescuing animals, I wouldn't in a million years assume that this will be controversial.\n    submitted by    /u/kamolescu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I did all the basics of math in school and I took an upgraded course before I could study comp. science at university.\n I was bad at it, and Math doesn't actually interest me. The sciences never did, so it's weird I've landed myself in Computer science, and truth be told, I'm not a particularly skilled programmer either. My field of interest lie in the aesthetics, the creative, and the collaboration of thinking of, and implementing games. I did just well enough in projects that I didn't feel discouraged from the entire field, and now I still want to be a contributor in game dev. That said, I feel like math or just my inattention to detail is a problem.\n During the higher education I encountered a few instances where I would tell someone \"Err, so I don't actually know how to write this\" and they'd say \"It's just phytagoras. I can't tell you what to do.\" and I had to figure something out on my own to make a cube move on the screen or something, and I ended up kinda not figuring it out, and I think eventually whoever said something about pythagoras did something on his own.\n And it's not like I don't know the pythagoras sentence, it's just that in practice I suck at math and barely know how to apply it. I remember some shit we drew on a blackboard but it doesn't come naturally to me to think mathematically.\n But now I'm facing specific needs like, I wanna figure out how to make an eye shader, cuz I have a 3D model where I'm dissatisfied with how glassy the eyes look. But people give me math stuff to figure it out. I'll be running in circles with some design I'm trying to code until some smart guy shows me some x = y2 + i > 0 ???? math that apparently solves it in one sentence.\n So I'm a bit agitated by my lack of appliccable knowledge. Do you find that Math is important to your average game work? And if I were to learn about how to develop my own shaders, is there some kind of book that could help me?\n    submitted by    /u/linkenski  \n [link]   [comments]",

I should probably just slap on a working title and go.\n I am reading advice that says \"Keep the game name short and not to use words a 7th grader cannot spell\", but the problem is essentially this:\n 1) Every freaking combination of common words are taken and potentially trademarked items (much like you can't get the web domain name you want)\n 2) Common words don't fare well as a search term.\n 3) Lots of successful games historically have featured a non-word or made up name.\n The title really makes or breaks the game in terms of mood or seriousness. Naming it something ambiguous like Nox Arcanum or Ultima sorta has the benefit that they don't really \"say\" anything about the game, and do not constrain the developer in terms of story or design.\n And of course I don't want to get sued if something is \"too close\" to something else. I have this paranoia that corporate behemoths are always going to try to squash indies that aren't inside their financial tent. :D\n What do you guys do? Does anyone else find this decision absolutely paralyzing?

The steam shop page exists for a few months, not resulting in many wishlists, which I would expect for a hobby project without marketing (except for a few YouTube shorts (~100-400 views each)).\n So the daily wishlists were around 0-1, mostly 0. Then, a few days ago, I checked the tags again, and compared them to the tags to \"The Escapists\", since the gameplay is pretty similar.\n Here is my little/big fuck-up: The tag I initially set with the highest priority is (in german) \"Ausbruchssimulation\", which can also be understood as a game where you/the player has to break out of somewhere. I was kinda wondering why \"The Escapists\" is not tagged with the same tag, as I would imagine it is the most fitting for this kind of game.\n I looked at the games that were tagged with \"Ausbruchssimulation\", saw stuff like Pague Inc. etc., and had an epiphany: changed the language to english, \"Ausbruchssimulation\" is the translation for \"Outbreak Sim\".\n Yeah, so i removed the tag and (at least for the four days since) this also had an impact on daily wishlists: https://ibb.co/GHgBXxh\n    submitted by    /u/projectbreakout  \n [link]   [comments]",

Without understanding market, game design and mechanics, scope and cost. It's especially irritating because mostly family and friends have that \"great ideas\" and I can't tell them to go away (usually).\n To anyone doing this and not understanding why gamedev usually don't pick up your ideas.\n Everyone have \"ideas\". I can literally from the top of my head in 1h give you 20 games ideas. 1 idea every 3 minutes. But ideas without full context, are not worth much. It's because every idea need days or weeks of actual work to create a design and validate if it's a good to make a game from it. With mechanics working together, with story, with scenario, with checking if similar games exist, with validating if mechanics are really working, if they are fun. And most of the time because of details in game design it will turn out \"the idea\" is not working. If you come to a gamedev with an \"idea\", understand that what really gamedev sees is not a solution, but a problem. You are basically asking someone to spend dozens of hours, maybe days or weeks to validate if \"the idea\" makes sense.\n If you want to cooperate with someone making games, make a full game design instead**.** Do the leg work. Prepare full concept. Check market. Play many games in genre of game from your \"idea\". Validate the concept as much as you can. Find assets. Learn what GDD is. If game is story driven - learn how to write. Write short stories first and check with audience your writing. Then write a story for your \"idea\". I mean - depending on the game type, spend at least 100-300h of work before you start talking to someone making games. Then be prepared to put another hundreds of hours of working closely with a gamedev.\n Ideas are cheap. 1 \"idea\" is created in 3 minutes.\n Full concepts are worth much more.

I'm actually not joking, If I had a time machine to 15 years ago, sigh\n Though if the hubris does overwhelm, pick an easier game genre, Something one person can do, no matter how brilliant you think you are, you really are not. Still it could of been worse I could of chosen a MMORPGGGGGH\n Don't make a major gameplay change midway (I done 2 on this game adventure, turn based -> realtime & dungeons -> Open World). Lesson learnt, If the game ain't happening, scrap it and start something new, don't try to shoehorn what you have into this cause it will bite you in the ass later \n Don't roll your own code. i.e re-invent the wheel, Sure this is oldhat advice. But take it from an oldfart, dont. I went from my own engine in c++/opengl & my own physics engine -> my engine + ODE -> Unity & C#. I wasn't cool rolling my own, I was just a dick wasting hours, hours that could of been useful realizing my dream \n  \nPositive advice:\n  \nOnly 2 rules in programming\n #1 KISS - Always keep it simple, you may think you're smart doing some shortcut or elegant solution, but 50% of the time you're creating problems down the track, why roll the dice, play it smart. OK this is a mantra but #2 is not well known\n #2 Treat everything as equal. AKA - don't make exceptions, no matter how much sense they appear to make, inevitably it will bite you in the ass later\n Now I still violate both the rules even now (after 40 years of programming) So this is do as I say, not as I do thing\n Don't be afraid to go out of your comfort zone.

I know little to nothing about how to write shaders but i think that it detects the edges of objects, selects some points with a set distance from each other and draws a straight line between them. I am not sure if it works like that but that's my best guess.\n Anyways, i would like other people to share their thoughts on this and some insight on where i could learn to write shaders. I will take a look at the docs in the meanwhile.\n    submitted by    /u/Glebzard  \n [link]   [comments]",

I started following tutorials as well and at the time I was bad and wished someone had helped me sooner understand how to overcome the problem I was facing.\n I am trying to help as much as I can here but I see a lot of posts that could be easily done by just looking at the documentation and it would be easy for me to look down and just say something like \"but look here, your answer is written in plein sight\" but I know the doc is also a technical intimidating document that beginners don't use as much.\n All of that to ask : \"Would you as a beginner be interested to know how to use the Godot documentation ?\"\n    submitted by    /u/tfhfate  \n [link]   [comments]",

I must say, it's sadly not very populated.\n I'm not sure why as the UI and site layout is perfect for it's role, I'd really love to see it used more.\n Are people aware of this site? If so are you willing to donate shader code to it?\n I've seen 20-30 posts sharing shader code over the past 2 days and I feel it rather sad that that code will practically vanish once the posts are thrown to the bottom of the reddit post stack. A lot of them just don't get enough attention to show up in search result so for all intents and purposes they're gone.\n I'd like to urge players to post their shaders on the site - it really is a great archive and I feel it would add a lot more permanency to your contribution.

          "description": "Hi r/godot,\n I've been working on a project called GodotInGameBuildingSystem, aimed at helping developers easily integrate building mechanics into their Godot games. It’s straightforward, open-source, and I hope it can be useful to some of you!\n Features:\n  \nDynamic Building: Add robust building functions that allow players to construct and customize their environments.\n Customizable: Adjust it to suit your game’s unique style and needs.\n Written in C#: Currently available in C#, ensuring robust performance and integration.\n Open Source: Free to use and modify under the MIT License—contributions are welcome!\n  \nWhy consider it?\n It’s built specifically for Godot, making integration smooth, and it’s a great way to add interactive elements to your game. I’d love for you to try it out and share any feedback or suggestions!\n Future Plans:\n I am planning to develop a version in GDScript based on community interest. The sooner I see significant interest, the faster I'll work on releasing the GDScript version!\n 👉 See it on Asset Store\n Thanks for checking it out, and happy developing!\n https://preview.redd.it/zeuwv7ap0xzc1.png?width=1909&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7965ac479b01febc11ec936a41a26f9834f1b42\n https://preview.redd.it/0ejea6ap0xzc1.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf4bd2c92bcfbbbd5a25dcf673401113043b2e47\n https://preview.redd.it/zsz2b7ap0xzc1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=57c6a919e2442096810898033963b6f90b2c434f\n https://preview.redd.it/9kz3s6ap0xzc1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bb891adf24bbdab584384b6a7100f283cbc0f7b\n https://preview.redd.it/i0ye79ap0xzc1.png?width=1910&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9fd5bafb4e69be8bd3953b53a355f2aaa25a30f\n    submitted by    /u/MaliciusD  \n [link]   [comments]",

Course is about WEB vulns, and I need to use BurpSuite and FoxyProxy.\n When both Foxy and burp are on, and the intercept on, pages won't load. The thing is that everything is correctly configured, like 127.0.0.1 port 8080, no exceptions on both Foxy/Burp. CA Port Swigger Certificate in place.\n But pages won't load, or they will load without interception. The worse thing is that my localhost page refuses to load when Foxy and Intercept are functioning, because my Labs are on localhost page, and I can't even have access to my labs.\n I tried and configured everything possible, I even changed ports to try. I also tried on seceral browsers : same thing. I updated/upgraded, restarted. Nothing. Tried with BurpSuite's built-in browser (Chromium) : same.\n I'm stuck for 1 (full) day and can't fin a solution. I always had some trouble with Foxy/Burp in the past except 1 time where it worked fine.\n I need to keep the intercept on because it's a part of my labs.\n Worse, when I decide to put the intercep off and stop foxy I have to restart my VM to get internet functioning.\n I can't work on my very last labs, and I'm afraid about my cert exam.\n Please do you have a solution ?

          "description": "I recall many moons ago when there were many full software versions that were trial-ware and held back by only a serial number. We could use a dis assembler and mod the assembly serial check to not jump out of the code when a bad serial was entered. We could reassemble and enter anything into the serial and had a full working software. Oh, them days was fun. Then the software programmers became smarter and they started checking for the disassembler. A ugly prompt would open up saying the disassembler software being used could not be used. I was sad. It was fun for a while just to see how things worked. Then it became hard. Doh. \n    submitted by    /u/Silent_Cup2508  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically I've found that one of the biggest wifi providers in my country uses a combination of a set prefix and the last few letters of the wifi name as a default password. I think that's still okay AS LONG AS THEY TELL PEOPLE TO CHANGE IT. I remember when we got our wifi, they just gave us the password and said that that was the one we needed to use. No recommendation to change the password or how we could do so. I had to do it myself once I realised that anyone could easily log into my wifi. Now I've tested this default password on every wifi network of the same provider I've come across. I've connected to around 20 of them and only one had changed their password. This is extremely dangerous because it's a (basically) open port to any wifi(one of the largest providers here btw) that can easily be exploited...\n So are the default passwords similarly set up where you live?\n I'd love to hear from you guys. I can say that as far as I've seen, in europe the passwords are randomly generated.\n Any advice is welcome!\n    submitted by    /u/Obviously_Special  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm wanting to unlock it so I could disable secure boot and boot anything that isn't just Windows or some Linux distro already signed with MS keys to allow for secure booting. I already know how to dump the BIOS chip (or the EC chip, rather) since I believe the password (or a hash of one) resides there. I already have a dump but I can't really write back since my SOIC8 clip is wearing off and doesn't want to stay attached at all anymore; I could hold it in place except that I have to be very steady with it (hard when it actively tries to pops off lmao) and will basically become unrecognized after around 10-15 seconds.\n Anyway, I'm wondering if it's possible to somehow extract the password (or a hash of it) from the dump I…",

Feel free to check it out and provide some feedback :)\n https://github.com/tomLamprecht/OTPPayloadInjector\n Disclaimer: I'm well aware that by publicly uploading this encoder it might get flagged by the windows defender soon as well but who cares, it's all about the fun! \n    submitted by    /u/Lampard557  \n [link]   [comments]",

So mods, if you delete this post, I would appreciate anyone letting me know a more appropriate place to post this.\n For background: I initially learned Java 8 years ago and it got me hooked on computer science. I've gone down a traditional path for the most part as I now do back-end IT work focused on cloud migration, though have done a number of ad hoc projects that go beyond that and worked in a more data-analyst-esque position before I ended up in this job 8 months ago. I have professional experience in Python, R, SQL (Redshift, SQL Server, MySQL, and MS Access for whatever that might count for...), VBA, and some familiarity with bash and PowerShell to the extent that I could use the internet to help me automate some recurring processes.\n I discovered ethical hacking recently and I think it's something I want to pursue. But, if I'm being honest, learning this feels pretty daunting and I'm not really sure where to begin (I've got a Linux VM booted up at the very least). \n More or less, I'm looking for someone with experience that I can learn from and get support from. If anyone is interested and wants to chat, I'd be more than happy to compensate with my own hourly wage if it becomes long-term (my hope) .\n Really, I'm just looking for quality resources for a complete beginner because, while I can code, I'm definitely lacking in the knowledge required here.\n    submitted by    /u/BeanPaddle  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd like to put Linux on it and I managed to install OS swapping the HD on another machine, problem is I really want to get rid of that password for future updates. Now I know I can probably buy an unprotected eeprom chip ans swap it but I'm not this good at soldering and I'd prefer to explore software solutions. \n HP has a command line tool (part of its client management tool set) called bios configurator utility. My understanding is that it requires the old password to replace it with a new one and it may accept plain text options for both (although I'm not sure if it only accept hashed versions in bin files at least for the old one. My questions are - may a bruteforce approach be viable? What would you suggest me to use first (e.g. Dictionary, rainbow tables...)in a hypotetical powershell script to cycle through, considering that I'm not a skilled programmer and it would be run on a slow machine? - are there other no-solder approaches I should also consider? Like, can I dump the eeprom chip and try to decode the password from there? \n Other things I tried: CMOS battery is not an option: it ran out but password is still there and if I input the wrong passwords I don't get to read the code that can be used for retrieving hard-coded backdoors\n    submitted by    /u/Jarngreipr9  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "tl;dr - What do you use with THM or HtB to help you remember what they've taught you (specifically when you're early on)?\n  \nI've been doing Try Hack Me for about a month or so. I've done enough to start to get at the meat and potatoes of hacking, but still far from being able to do it on my own.However, I do have a concern. As I'm continuing my journey on this website, I'm finding that I'm forgetting some things. I'll know the general idea, but not the exact bits of information I'd need in the moment.\n I know the default answer to this is just study, but even if I strap myself to a chair and pin my eyelids open like I'm in Clockwork Orange, I still struggle to remember stuff. I learn best by doing and repetition of the doing, but I'm not sure what I can use aside from THM and Hack the Box. I'm still not at a point to be doing an CTF challenges (as far as I know), so those aren't really an option.\n What I want to know, is what do you guys use in conjunction with these? I looked at the wiki, and I plan on trying some of them out, but I worry that they're going to be too dense/technical for me. Are there any other resources to help familiarize yourself with hacking concepts/tools? Key word being \"familiarize\". I've done the lessons, but need reminders before I can fully commit it to memory.\n EDIT: I should mention that I do takes notes as I go through the lessons, and it does help, but it doesn't help me full grasp these concepts when it's just simple tidbits of information\n    submitted by    /u/MakeMoreFae  \n [link]   [comments]",

Money is a big concern for me, especially since my dad is retiring soon leaving me in-charge of being the breadwinner of the family, taking care of both my parents and my sibling who will at one point sooner or later also be going to university...\n Here's the deal: I'm not exactly a math whiz, and the thought of getting tangled up in complex equations in a CS program is daunting. I've heard that Cybersecurity might be a bit lighter on the math, which sounds like a relief.\n But I also want to make sure I'm setting myself up for a solid career path with good job prospects and financial stability on a global scale. So, which field do you think offers a more secure role and better opportunities in the long run?\n Any insights or experiences you can share would be super helpful.

There is zero identifying details on my fob, no text or markings. Please see the attached pictures.\n After looking into a bit it, it appears the promark3 or a service such as “clone my key” / a key duplicating kiosk could work.\n What would be the simplest / not super expensive path forward?\n    submitted by    /u/UniversitySeeds  \n [link]   [comments]",

Recently, I've been doing some code reviews and playing CTFs, all of which I'm doing on the provided machine over an SSH connection. However, whatever I do on the provided SSH server is getting logged in a file and somewhere else as well, but I don't have access to read or write these logs. Now, every single command that I run on their machine gets logged, and there's a challenge where I have to initiate an SSH connection or run any UNIX commands without them being logged into that file.\n Is there any way to do this? Also, I was thinking if I write a Python or Bash script and then perform tasks on the provided machine, maybe only the execution of the script with its name will get logged.\n Does anyone have an idea or suggestions on HOWTO do this?\n    submitted by    /u/RoninPark  \n [link]   [comments]",

I could download the module, and it even showed up when I used pip freeze. But I couldn't import it. \n I watched the video by Python Programmer and learned how to make virtual environments on my PC to control my Python projects. I also learned you could use Python in the command prompt and test simple commands, which is pretty sick. \n I now have more control over my projects, a better understanding of the command line and its usefulness, and my programs aren't broken in half anymore. Also, I ran a program that imports the pyperclip module and I didn't get the error telling me the module can't be found. I've been seeing this error nonstop for 4 days dude.

The course consisted of a bunch of lessons and exercises between each lesson. You were expected to finish the exercises BEFORE watching their resolution and proceeding to the next lesson. \n After finishing that course, I decided I wanted to try Web Development, because so far all I was doing were programs that would run on terminals and not look very presentable. I wanted to start building things that I could show to friends and ask their opinion on, not to mention I really value the web environment in general since personally I wouldn't have learnt much in this field if it wasn't for its existence (since I'm self-taught). \n So I started the freeCodeCamp path.

I am a junior front end developer currently working with mainly react and have been at this job steadily for 4 months now. \n For a bit of context before learning to code seriously, I was always interested in coding but thought I was not smart enough. I started learning multiple times in the past and gave up because I didn't believe in myself. I think this is very common, because of the stereotypes that programmers are inherently gifted or obsessed with computers - there's the mindset of if you're not obsessed you shouldn't be a developer, which is nonsense!\n At the beginning of 2023, I was miserable in my current job, wanted a challenge and a better life.

I have applied internships in the past and last year I got an interview with conEdison about an internship opportunity for computer science but I did not get it. I reached out to other companies but I never got an answer back. So I am just lost and unmotivated. I also have a fear to do interviews now because Im not an expert in programing yet, I dedicated my time doing well in school and doing other subjects in classes that my focus in being a good programmer shifted to just getting work done. I want to have a place in the field because I feel that if I am in a tech working environment, then I will thrive and do more in that aspect of the career. \n I worked on several small projects like database management project, some small python projects, web development (html, css, javascript) when I made a grocery store website. and my latest project was making an android app in regards to finding a visa. So I have some experience but not enough to answer any technical questions such as problem solving and algorithms. But I really want to and I feel like all of that motivation I had faded a little bit. \n After I completed my bachelors and when I also finished my finals I felt so drained that I did not feel like getting up from bed, going out, I could not focus on my planning. so I am very demotivated, but I had some time to rest and reflect, my mind feels bit clear.

          "description": "I started my programming journey 5 years ago in frontend development. I was so happy when I got my first job. As the only female developer in the company, I was scared that I wouldn't fit in, but it was completely the opposite! Three years later, the company is shutting down, and I will soon be out of a job.\n After I started applying for jobs a few months ago, I realized how much I don't know. I can build something, and most of the time I'll find a solution and complete the task, or the app. I felt like I understood most of the things I was working with.\n A few months ago, an interviewer asked me about state management in Angular, and I looked at him like he came from another planet.\n Of course, that didn't go well, and I didn't get a job offer. I decided to ask the team lead at my current job about this question, and he told me that we never really used state management in the apps we were building.\n Not to mention that the latest version we were working with was 12.\n This is all my mistake. Complaining about the amount of work I had to do, or the overtime work would be a bad excuse. Instead of focusing only on the tasks, I should have kept learning in my free time. Now that version 18 is out, I am missing a lot, and I feel so embarrassed. I am scared of applying for jobs now and am even reconsidering working in a coffee shop until I catch up on all the missing concepts we never covered at my soon-to-be ex-company. I should have found a mentor a lot earlier.\n Enough of this.\n To everyone entering the world of programming and learning: don't give up if you're passionate about it. Continuous learning is essential in this field, and I learned it the harder way.\n    submitted by    /u/DullMoment_1  \n [link]   [comments]",

And how do they do this? Is this a special file I access or a library in a programming language? How does this work? * When I use, let‘s say an USB device from my app, how do I access it? Do I use such an API of the driver (e.g. an USB HID driver)? Must I interpret USB packets / HID reports?\n A concrete example would be greatly appreciated.

          "description": "Comming from data science learning OOP (with C#) is actually not easy for me and I wonder if other people feel the same:\n Want to print \"Hello World\"? You need a class for that. What is a class? A class can instantiate objects and has fields and methods. Ok. What are fields? A field is a Variable of any type that is declared directly inside a class or structure. Fields should not be accessed directly but always through Properties. Ok what the fuck is a property? A property is a member of a class that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field. Huh? Private fields? And then you go from there to accessors, getters setters, encapsulation, Interfaces, abstraction, Abstract classes, delegates, SOLID, KISS, etc. etc.. Compared to, say Python, C# feels like it puts many hurdles purposefully in front of you to execute seemingly easy tasks.\n Or in other words: It feels like watching Harry Potter part 5 without any knowledge of the previous parts. You can appreciate the film for its value but have no clue why things are happening. The level of abstraction in C# if you were to start learning today puts a huge backlog of concepts and things to learn on you.\n More specific: my main gripe at the moment is that it is actually not trivial how to communicate between classes and that I still never know when I need to instantiate an object or not to get the functionality I need. Accessor types are also still a mystery for me in practice although I know everything I need to know in theory.\n In Data science the whole process of writing code is much more sequential and I feel I get more oportunities to actually write the juicy parts where as in C# I am constantly held back by code structure and architecture.\n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/Mafiale  \n [link]   [comments]",

Additionally, I found him to be quite unapproachable when it came to asking for help. All around me were coding geniuses, and I couldn't understand anything. It made the classes hell for me, and overall, it just distanced me from coding.\n A few weeks ago, I started to try to learn again by enrolling in the Harvard CS50 course on EdX. But I can't seem to find time to do it, and again, coding just doesn't seem interesting. Plus, I'm really burned out from school right now. The only motivation I have for coding is its pay. I want to like it and I want to learn, but I can't pick up on anything, and I still haven't developed an interest in it. \n I really needed to get all of this off my chest, as my sister doesn't understand why I don't want to do it, and I'm just really stressed right now with exams coming up and schoolwork in general. \n I really want to know if anybody was in a similar situation. \n Thanks for reading all of this\n    submitted by    /u/yuzzy21  \n [link]   [comments]",

Go through the documentation, browse Stack Overflow, and struggle to build your project. It's okay to write subpar code in the beginning. Build the project first, then fix and optimize the code later. This process will help you become a better engineer.\n Expert engineers, what are your thoughts on this advice? Is it good? Is there anything you would like to add?\n Thanks in advance! \n    submitted by    /u/AccomplishedPie1255  \n [link]   [comments]",

I ran into an issue where my code was producing unexpected results, but not crashing.\n I considered adding print() statements in my code, but I thought it would be hard to toggle all of them on and off using individual comments. Then I thought I might use a Boolean variable, and if that variable was True, it would allow all the print() functions to fire. But this adds a lot of lines of code to a project, 1 line for the if statement and then another line for the print. So that's 2 lines every time I want to check, and if I have 50 things I want to check that's 100 extra lines of code.\n I don't know what this is called but I feel like being able to print out the precise steps a program is executing is important information and I haven't seen it discussed in the book yet. \n My IDE is Notepad++. I am specifically using Notepad++ because it doesn't have any autocomplete and it forces me to type everything out by hand--but I'm wondering if another IDE might have something that allows this print() debugging thing to be easier for me.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/glide_bro  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am pretty new to coding, and have been doing two courses these last two or three months and am now doing projecta from Big Book Small Python Projects. I am having a LOT of fun, and learning a lot I didn’t know I could do. \n Anyways, I am struggling with shite memory sometimes and just wanted some input on what level of ”forgetfulness” is ”normal” and if you feel it has improved with practice. \n When I write a project that is a bit longer (for me that is maybe 200+ lines) I always make extensive docstrings, doctests/examples of use and write comments next to most expressions. I might be doing this too much, but if I don’t I just forget how the expression or loop or whatever works. \n I often look at something the next day and think (why the hell does it say (x + y + 1) here? Is it the index position or why did I need that +1 again. Or for example, ”what data type was this variable now”? (Well maybe not the last one but it is just an example) If I am working on something during friday I will keep working one or two hours during the weekend too or come monday I am so out of the mindset I just have to basically relearn my code.\n I am not really looking for a guide on when and how to comment your code, I could google that (but it is still welcome if anyone feels like sharing their process) but more input on what level of forgeting the project and how the code works is normal, and how you have developed this ability over time or if you rely almost entirely on comments. \n What do you think about this? \n Edit: the use of x + y is just an example.

I guess experience will help with that, but what resources do experienced people turn to? Documentation? How do you find what you need without reading everything?

I'm seeing people say udemy is good. Would you guys recommend? a coupon code seems to be attached with the link already too. https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/?couponCode=LEADERSALE24B\n I did try YT and search for people teaching python, but there's so many people doing it, is there one specific channel / guide you guys would recommend if not taking an online course?\n EDIT AGAIN: So after spending a few hours trying out Python vs GDScript. I'm going to be going with GD script. I'm loving how it works just slightly better then Python, but both are good.

          "description": "Hello, everyone! I recently returned from the war, in which I participated for more than 2 years (I am an officer of the Armed Forces of Ukraine), and it so happened that I decided to change my profession. I have always been interested in IT and technology, how everything works \"under the hood\". Now I'm studying the Python programming language, everything seems to be okay, I understand how it works, what is involved and the specifics, but when it comes to performing some independent task, I just get stuck. It doesn't seem like a very difficult task, but I can sit for days and think about how to do it, and eventually I start doing a lot of googling and using artificial intelligence to solve it, and everything works out. But there is no such thing as me realizing how to do it better on my own. Although other people in my study group do it much faster than me, so I sometimes lose motivation, but I keep doing it. And I feel stupid all the time. Maybe I'm not studying very effectively, what would you advise me to do in such a situation? Thank you all for your response.\n    submitted by    /u/spa7id  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dependencies for languages, specifically python\n I was downloading Python today and was wondering the general rules for what is needed to actually make a language work. So I see this\n So is \"Python 3\" a complier or something? What actually is \"Python 3\" from their website? Is it a compiler? If its just \"the language,\" what actually is that? Obviously, VS Code is just the IDE. But then what is VS Code Python extension? Is that just preparing the IDE for using Python? What would happen if you just get the VS Code Extension and not actually Python 3? \n TLDR; What are the needed tools for setting up and using a coding language? Difference between the actual download from their website(Python, Oracle, Jetbrains) and the extension in the IDE? \n    submitted by    /u/FlashyEnvironment534  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm a university lecturer in Switzerland, teaching web development basics to my students. As part of their coursework, they need to create a small web app using real-world data from APIs.\n While searching for reliable and relevant APIs, I stumbled upon the famous Public API List on GitHub. While checking out the list, I found that many of the APIs are no longer free, no longer public or have been discontinued.\n To address the problem of outdated APIs, I created a small website called freepublicapis.com, which contains my collection of APIs and tests all endpoints every four hours. The site logs responses and measures metrics such as response time and error rate. Currently, there are 28 APIs available, many of which are from Swiss public institutions.\n If you know any cool APIs from your city or country, that helped you learn programming, it would be fantastic if you could contribute them to the website. Your participation could make this website relevant to students learning web development around the world.\n    submitted by    /u/Gotopik  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Not a big thing really, but i thought i'd share.\n Part of my job is running Updates on customer systems with ansible. The includes 2 things: \"Initiate\" the Update by selecting an environment to work with (this ensures you don't have to attach the -i flag to every ansible-playbook command) and then running 4-6 playbooks. Additionally, i do \"custom\" rollouts with any subset out of 30 or so playbooks, which are all contained in a folder.\n I was growing tired of having to type the path to customer inventorys and autofilling playbook names. This is tedious and with playooks often having similar names, i tended to have to type them out almost completely.\n So today, i spend a grand total of 20 minutes putting together two scripts that pipe either the environments or playbooks into fzf and the runs the needed command. So i now get interactive fuzzy search through our customers and playbooks. All of that without having to get a software approved by IT and all done in 10 lines of bash total.\n This then also made me realize i can just push my entire ssh config with some grep and filtering into fzf to get an interactive \"ssh launcher\".\n So really, 30 minutes spend wipping up 3 scripts that will now make my job easier and nicer every day. And that's possible because so many awesome tools are made to \"just work\" with each other through text input and output. That's why i love working on Linux every day.\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

I won't bother you with the reasons since they're irrelevant for this discussion.\n Anyway, I switched to LM precisely because it was touted as a good distro for \"beginners\". In the time since I switched, I've been educating myself a bit on the whole Linux ecosystem and I can't help but think that the label \"for beginners\" is actually a mislabel and that it gives off the wrong impression.\n The general advice more or less goes: If you're new to Linux, get a beginner's distro like LM or Zorin or Pop. And then when you 'learn' Linux, you can step up to the 'real' deal (i.e. distro-hop) with the end-destination usually being Arch.\n But, from …",

And the great thing is that FOSS developers don't gatekeep their software from Windows/macOS (unlike the other way around), so they can install pretty much every free and open source software out there.\n How do I know this method works? Because it's how I fell in love with FOSS and Linux. I needed a way to remux a video file and all the options out there were paid. Until I came upon ffmpeg, which allowed you to not only remux video, but to do pretty much anything with it. It seemed too good for something that good to be free. That's when I looked into it and learned about free and open source software. After that I slowly switched all of my software to free and open source alternatives, until the only proprietary thing left on my PC was Windows itself.\n    submitted by    /u/crosspacelayer  \n [link]   [comments]",

After that every Steam game not using OpenGL failed to open, but after opening Steam through terminal I realised it's because 'Steam could not initalize Vulkan' (or something to that effect). After a few hours of troubleshooting, thinking it was my drivers, or the Vulkan installation and considering just reinstalling the OS, I seen a post where someone said to reinstall Steam. After manually adding the repository and reinstalling it, lo and behold everything worked absolutely fine. I believe it's because installing it through apt, it installs 32-bit drivers that you don't get with the App Center version. This is a very dumbed down version of events, I was troubleshooting for a while.\n Perhaps it's my fault, I'm not sure. But, to my knowledge, I did what any typical user would do. Install OS - Update OS - Install drivers - Install Steam (through apt), which failed, so I chose to install through the App Center. So, I'm going to put fault on Ubuntu for this one.

Mind you, that I'm using NixOS Stable channel, so I only get Plasma 5.27, but even I'm well satisfied. I used GNOME for about 3 years, before switching to KDE Plasma.\n People say KDE Plasma is too much like Windows, it's too much customization, or it's too buggy. I can argue that GNOME isn't enough. It's great for simple users who don't want to customize anything, but over time, it became annoying that the DE had limits, which you could only modify if you added extensions.\n The only bugs I've seen are graphical glitches that causes some stuttering. But it's not really a deal breaker.\n Graphically, KDE Plasma is very impressive. There's a charming affect whenever this DE interacts with you. There's especially a lot \"fading\" effects, like pressing meta key, dragging different open windows, or opening things on the taskbar. But their selection of desktop backgrounds, even their \"start button,\" and even starting it up where it shows the Plasma icon; it's all so charming. Even their notification sounds are very distinguishable.\n Whereas in GNOME, you get some irrelevant sounds like \"dog bark\" or \"glass\" or \"pop\" sound. None of these sounds have style, nor are they memorable.\n It feels really nice when DEs not only make something nice and snappy, but also put some thought and effort into the branding. In GNOME, all you see is the \"activities\" corner, and that doesn't really help, and I can hardly remember the \"foot print\" logo.\n I do have to say, GNOME has made some very useful software that's hard to pass on: GNOME Disks and Disk Usage Analyzer to say the least. I still use some of the default GNOME programs in my systems.\n But overall, KDE Plasma is very impressive.\n    submitted by    /u/nPrevail  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "With the introduction of the Recall feature for Windows, there is renewed interest in the Linux desktop. With that renewed interest, comes renewed hate toward the Linux desktop by people who feel personally confronted by the privacy + freedom oriented philosophy most Linux users subscribe to.\n \"Privacy doesn't matter to me\" is the common response.\n That is fine. What should matter to users is reliance. Plenty of potential Linux users forgoe the switch because their favorite big tech software doesn't run on Linux.\n \"I have built spreadsheets that don't open in LibreOffice/OpenOffice\"\n \"I need Adobe to edit pictures/create music/read my DRM protected books\"\n These are statements that should give you pause. Is it acceptable that you are reliant on a piece of software to the extent that it ties you to an operating system and set of apps that could be taken away from you at any second? Let us focus on the first statement; how much will you pay for Excel (either in cash or your privacy) so that you can continue editing your favorite spreadsheet? Is there a point at which you would force yourself to learn how to program or translate these spreadsheets into LibreOffice?\n You may not care about Privacy or Freedom, but Microsoft and Apple will at some point set a price that will have you wishing you were Independent.\n No one who switches to Linux should expect the transition to be easy. There will be quirks on your system that you will have to iron out and there are just fundamental differences between Windows and Linux that you will have to get used to. In other words you will need to learn. If you think that is a waste of time, that's fine. In my eyes, and in many others', learning a new skill is never a waste if time.\n I hope this provides a useful perspective.\n    submitted by    /u/wallbucks  \n [link]   [comments]",

I spent a day debugging this and installed ~5 different distros but still found no solution.\n Being done I got up from my computer, turned on my TV and saw my desktop on the TV. The computer was connected to the TV via HDMI and would make it a primary display despite it being turned off... Having 5 years of experience with Linux I started exploring drivers, looking into logs etc. and it didn't occur to me to check the connected displays.\n Do you have any stories with Linux where you turned out to be a complete idiot when in reality the solution was as simple as unplugging a cable?\n    submitted by    /u/Mrkaniclol  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Here's what I believe Microsoft (and partners) have in store for the future: they are going all-in on pulling an Apple-style switch to ARM on the PC hardware market. This move has several concomitant side-effects:\n  \nMaking AI a mandatory feature on the PC, with all the juicy free data they will be able to harvest from it. Requiring an NPU (i.e. an AI-capable chip) as a standard on all future PCs.\n Herding all the PC Gamer market onto the XBOX (which will still be Intel/AMD based) and possibly onto other upcoming compatible consoles (there's been talk of allowing Steam and Epic marketplaces on the XBOX platform, which would be HUGE... also, a Steam console, anyone?) It's possible that the x86_64 architecture will remain in wide use as gaming hardware.\n (Possibly) Locking down the ability of booting Linux or any other OS on such ARM hardware. This should be contested with all the Anti-Trust legal recourse available everywhere. (EDIT: disproved here)\n Setting back the advance of the Linux marketshare at least for a while. \n  \nThis last point is the one I would emphasize the most: currently, Linux on ARM seems to be kind of an afterthought among developers, and most distributions have builds targeted at the Raspberry Pi and such small platforms. To my knowledge, only RHEL (and its community clones) offer an ARM build with full desktop capabilities, but these seem to be targeted at servers.\n How long until the major Linux distributions catch up with the switch to ARM, and become ready to deliver the current level of software reliability onto the new PCs?\n Easy with the downvoting, people!\n I am presenting my concerns here, I believe these issues should be discussed.

          "description": "I've heard a lot that a benefit for using terminal software over GUI apps is that they use much less resources. And that's why its better to SSH into servers rather than have them use up resources for a display server, Quartz X11 Wayland etc.. But terminals aren't just outputting raw text, they have text and background colors per character, TUI frameworks have been made for them to essentially have GUI-like elements, like Neovim and Ranger. Things like the Kitty Graphics Protocol seem to blur the lines. While I don't know the technical details (please explain if you can!), it's nice that it can render images in the terminal, but how is it different, especially the technical details and resource demand (CPU GPU RAM etc.) to display servers?!

Yes, I am aware that there already are some on the market, but they might or might not be the next big thing. I wanted informed opinions to what extent this is a threat to the current non-professional use of Linux. As things currently stand, you can pretty much install Linux easily on anything you buy from e.g., BestBuy, and, even more importantly, you can install it on a device that you purchased before you even had any inkling that Linux would be something you'd use.\n Feel free to correct me, but here is as I understand the situation as a non-tech professional. Everything here with a caveat \"in the foreseeable future\".\n  \nIntel/AMD are not going to disappear, and it is uncertain to what extent ARM laptops will take over. There will be Linux certified devices for professionals regardless and, obviously, Linux compatible-hardware for, say, for server use.\n Linux has been running on ARM devices for a long time, so ARM itself is not the issue. My understanding is that that boot systems for ARM devices are less standardized and many current ARM devices need tailored solutions for this. And then there is the whole Apple M-series devices issue, with lots of non-standard hardware.\n  \nSince reddit/the internet is full of \"chicken little\" reactions to poorly understood/speculative tech news, I wanted to ask to what extent you think that the potential new wave of ARM Windows laptops is going to be:\n a) not a big deal, we will have Linux running on them easily in a newbie-friendly way very soon, or\n b) like the Apple M-series, where progress will be made, but you can hardly recommend Linux on those for newbies?\n Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/nongaussian  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone!\n Something a bit wild happened to me, and I wanted to share the story. So, a few days ago, I bricked my laptop during a routine system update. I'm not sure what happened, my guess is it hibernated at a critical time of the system update.\n So, I pull out my trusted USB Arch installer, mount my ssh, arch-chroot, rerun the update to try and fix it, it runs successfully, all well and good. \n I reboot, and the boot sequence welcomes me with a message about my lvm partition being corrupted. I try to let the repair tool run, but to no avail: my system has about 0.5% of my blocks corrupted. Instead of trying to repair it, I decide that the easiest way forward is to do a fresh install. \n Here's the catch. I had a 10h plane trip planned for months 2 days later. Well, if I have 10h to kill, maybe I can use it to reinstall Arch? I check online, and internet access on the plane is not too expensive, so... Why the heck not. \n Fast forward today, as soon as we take off, I start the install, using my mobile phone as a hotspot (to avoid having to deal with signing into the plane wifi website directly) and a Arch Wiki browser. As usual, it takes me a few tries to get a bootable system, but I get there! \n It was a very interesting experience, because with a very slow connection, I had to be very careful and minimalistic about which packages I install. I now have a simple KDE Plasma + a browser running on Arch, all at 30k feet above ground. \n    submitted by    /u/Skasch  \n [link]   [comments]",

What are you people doing to your system where you have to constantly fix it? What kind of maintenance are you doing all the time that requires you to be a super advanced user? \n I use TimeShift to backup my system prior to updating anything important (OS, Nvidia drivers, or anything related to Gnome, etc) or messing around with anything important (grub, specific apps, etc). If an issues occur, I revert back. It really isn't that complicated.\n Is this just gatekeeping? Am I completely missing something? For an average Linux user, is Arch REALLY that difficult?\n For reference, I have been using Arch for a few months now (before that, I used ZorinOS and Ubuntu). My system runs Gnome on Wayland with a Nvidia RTX 4080 graphics card. I have experienced zero lag, rubberbanding, or any other display issues.

It drives me nuts!\n There's fix available but it appears to me I need to apply some patches into my Linux Zen kernel. Is there a better way of applying this fix? Do I need to recompile the whole kernel? What's the right way of doing this?\n Patches are available at the end of the issue report and are already in amd-staging-drm-next, but I'm not sure what that is... Is it the latest stable kernel with bleeding-edge AMD DRM patches or is it a totally new & future unstable kernel version?\n (i'm not a total linux noob and know how to code, just never did this)\n    submitted by    /u/oiledhairyfurryballs  \n [link]   [comments]",

This weekend I loaded Arch up into a KVM/Qemu VM and was blown away on how freaking fast and customizable it was with only the pittance of resources I gave the VM.

Let me explain.\n For every single application I have tested, (Web browser, the KDE sound test, Discord, basically all of the apps that I need to not have delayed audio, for the desktop to be smooth-sailing) and all of them weirdly showed the same problem. (Playing audio for the first time would show a ~0.4s delay before playing, and after pausing/having zero sound being played in the moment, would \"reset\" the timer and give me more delay.) Weirdly, this did not have an affect with the sync as you'd might expect, but that's made it significantly more difficult to find a solution to the problem I've been facing, this also seems to only be happening with my built-in laptop speakers, and not with any bluetooth/wired headphones.\n If any other information is needed I'll gladly bring it up, but I believe (currently) that this is the best I can do.

          "description": "I got pissed off at Windows for being so slow and awful for the last time. I couldn't change anything and OneDrive was clogging up my file explorer. So I decided to install Mint. Then I found out that Mint was running Kernel version 5.15 which couldn't support my network card (6 month old laptop). I downloaded windows again and realized their installation tool didn't have a working built in network driver. At that point panic started to set in. I couldn't update my driver because that meant connecting to the internet which I couldn't do! But apparently a few minutes of searching led me here. It just works! Wow! The Windows installation tool was 7GB and it still didn't have a working driver inside. Thanks debian. \n    submitted by    /u/Eurodancing  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then tried fedora, I actually liked it, but the KDE spin is too bloated and dnf is pretty slow for me even after adding parallel downloads and fastestmirror, even using dnf5, the speeds are really REALLY shitty in my country, I guess it's a mirror and region problem not a dnf one. Besides why does it use so many resources on idle??? 2.8gb RAM, that's literally MORE THAN THRICE of what Arch used, Battery Life was also much worse compared to arch, also those ugly windows-esque offline updates at boot really irked me, although I did turn them off. Throw in RedHat/IBM and the excitement goes away. Finally ended up installing a minimal debian and installing pipewire, ufw etc. and the minimal kde desktop on top of it. Debian is where I'm gonna stay, been using it for 3 months and I love it. The workload on my laptop isn't as intense and debian handles it pretty well (I'm a law student, I just open documents and a web browser, I have no time for tinkering or trying out new stuff.

I've tried setting up dropbear with initramfs so I can decrypt remotely via SSH and have a PiKVM as a backup method, but I still look upon Windows systems with envious eyes that BitLocker just works and allows a system to boot up automatically whilst still being protected against physical access.\n I realise that a secure passphrase that must be typed in every boot will always be the most secure option and some TPM's can be sniffed, but for my threat model this is more than acceptable. My TPM is CPU embedded and my server isn't in a shared space.\n I guess my main questions are:\n  \nHow do you go about configuring LUKS to decrypt itself using the TPM?\n What things do I need to do to prevent root access to someone who steals the machine?

          "description": "I'm trying to do a minimal Gnome install, so I installed gnome-core. However it includes a few packages I don't care about, such as totem, gnome-sushi, yelp. But uninstalling those also tries to uninstall gnome-core.\n My first thought was to create a new deb package called gnome-core-overrides that includes those 3 packages in the \"provides\" field, but that didn't work. Neither did including it in the \"replaces\" field. This reddit comment implies this is possible, but it's not working for me. I also followed the steps from this tutorial.\n I also tried creating blank packages called totem, gnome-sushi, yelp, but when installing them, apt tries to be smart and tells me it's going to install the repo version rather than my local .deb file. I didn't try installing it directly with dpkg though, maybe that's worth a try (but even then, this wouldn't be my preferred way since then I would have to create a dummy deb for each package I don't want).\n    submitted by    /u/that_leaflet  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am running debian 12 on my old HP laptop without a battery as a personal server that I SSH into. The laptop is designed in such a way that it does not use a CMOS battery which is supposed to be supplimented by power from the battery. Everything works all smooth considering that the laptop is always powered. Any blackout requires me to manually set the time every time. This only happened after I switched to Debian, before I was running Kali (I know its a dumb using Kali as a server) and the time auto updated itself.\n 1. what could I have gone wrong when doing the Debian setup?\n  \nCould the battery really affect the time setup?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Odd_Astronomer309  \n [link]   [comments]",
